# Architecture Map

## Status

- Version: 1.0
- Status: Stable
- Audience: Architects, Contributors, Maintainers

# Purpose

The Architecture Map provides a global view of the FamilyOS architecture and
describes how the different architectural capabilities interact.

Its purpose is to provide a common understanding of architectural boundaries,
relationships and dependency directions across the FamilyOS platform.

This document does not define individual architectural responsibilities.

Individual responsibilities are defined by dedicated architecture documents.

---

# Architectural Role

The Architecture Map represents the structural overview of FamilyOS.

It connects the different architecture capabilities into a coherent platform
model.

The Architecture Map helps contributors understand:

- where responsibilities belong;
- how components communicate;
- which dependencies are allowed;
- how the platform evolves.

The Architecture Map does not replace detailed architecture definitions.

Each architectural component remains responsible for its own boundaries.

# Architecture Layers

FamilyOS architecture is organized into multiple layers with clearly defined
responsibilities.

The architecture layers provide separation between business capabilities,
platform capabilities and technical execution.

---

# Core Architecture

The Core Architecture defines the fundamental business and platform concepts
that support FamilyOS.

It includes:

- Domain Architecture;
- Application Architecture;
- Identity Architecture;
- Security Architecture;
- Data Architecture.

The Core Architecture represents stable capabilities that define FamilyOS
behavior and information boundaries.

---

# Platform Architecture

The Platform Architecture provides capabilities that enable communication,
extension, automation and intelligence across FamilyOS.

It includes:

- API Architecture;
- Event Architecture;
- Notification Architecture;
- Workflow Architecture;
- AI Architecture;
- Integration Architecture;
- Observability Architecture;
- Plugin Architecture;
- Generation Architecture.

The Platform Architecture enables FamilyOS capabilities to evolve while
preserving architectural boundaries.

---

# Supporting Capabilities

Supporting capabilities provide technical and operational foundations for the
platform.

They include:

- infrastructure execution;
- runtime capabilities;
- deployment mechanisms;
- configuration management;
- monitoring capabilities.

Supporting capabilities enable the execution of FamilyOS without defining
business behavior.

# Architecture Relationships

FamilyOS architecture components communicate through explicit boundaries and
controlled dependencies.

The relationships between architectures define how capabilities collaborate
while preserving separation of responsibilities.

---

# Domain and Application Relationship

The Domain Architecture defines business meaning and rules.

The Application Architecture coordinates business capabilities through use
cases.

Relationship:

~~~text
Application
        │
        ▼
Domain
~~~

Application depends on domain capabilities but does not define business rules.

---

# Event and Notification Relationship

The Event Architecture represents significant occurrences within FamilyOS.

The Notification Architecture transforms relevant events into communications
for actors.

Relationship:

~~~text
Domain Events
        │
        ▼
Event Architecture
        │
        ▼
Notification Architecture
        │
        ▼
Actors
~~~

Events represent facts.

Notifications communicate those facts.

---

# Workflow and Application Relationship

The Workflow Architecture coordinates complex multi-step processes.

The Application Architecture uses workflows to orchestrate activities that
require multiple interactions.

Relationship:

~~~text
Application
        │
        ▼
Workflow
        │
        ▼
Domain / Events / Notifications
~~~

Workflows coordinate execution without replacing business rules.

---

# AI and Data Relationship

The AI Architecture provides intelligence capabilities using authorized
information.

The Data Architecture defines information ownership and lifecycle principles.

Relationship:

~~~text
Data
        │
        ▼
Authorized Knowledge
        │
        ▼
AI Services
~~~

AI uses information but does not own business data.

---

# AI and Application Relationship

The AI Architecture proposes candidate actions; it does not execute them.

The Application Architecture receives, mediates, and evaluates proposals
before any effect occurs.

Relationship:

~~~text
AI
        │
        ▼
Application
~~~

AI conveys no authorization. Application mediates; it does not itself
authorize (see Security and Identity Relationship).

---

# Security and Identity Relationship

The Identity Architecture defines actors interacting with FamilyOS.

The Security Architecture protects access and information.

Relationship:

~~~text
Identity
        │
        ▼
Security
        │
        ▼
Protected Capabilities
~~~

Identity answers who is interacting.

Security determines what access is allowed.

---


---

# Dependency Model

FamilyOS follows controlled dependency directions to preserve architectural
independence and long-term evolution.

Dependencies should always respect responsibility boundaries.

The global dependency model is:

~~~text
Presentation
        │
        ▼
Application
        │
        ▼
Domain

Platform Capabilities
        │
        ├── Events
        ├── Notifications
        ├── Workflows
        ├── AI
        ├── API
        └── Integrations

Supporting Capabilities
        │
        ▼
Infrastructure
~~~

Each architecture component communicates through explicit contracts.

---

# Allowed Dependencies

FamilyOS allows dependencies following architectural responsibility.

Allowed examples:

~~~text

        │
        ▼
Domain Capabilities


Workflow
        │
        ▼
Application Services


Notification

Authorized Data


AI
        │
        ▼

API

Application Capabilities
~~~

Dependencies must preserve the separation between business meaning,
orchestration and technical execution.

---

# Architectural Rules

The following rules apply across FamilyOS architecture.

## Rule 1 — Domain Independence

The Domain component defines business meaning.

Other components may use domain capabilities but must not redefine business
rules.

---

## Rule 2 — Explicit Contracts

Architectural communication must happen through explicit contracts.

Hidden dependencies should be avoided.

---

## Rule 3 — Security Boundaries

All access to protected capabilities must respect Identity and Security
boundaries.

No component may bypass authorization requirements.

---

## Rule 4 — Data Ownership

Data ownership belongs to the responsible domain or data capability.

Components must not create uncontrolled copies of authoritative information.

---

## Rule 5 — Traceable Evolution

Changes affecting architectural boundaries must follow FamilyOS RFC and ADR
processes.

Architecture evolution must remain documented and understandable.

---


---

# Evolution Guidelines

The FamilyOS Architecture Map should evolve while preserving architectural
clarity, responsibility boundaries and dependency rules.

Future architectural changes should:

- preserve separation of responsibilities;
- maintain explicit communication contracts;
- protect domain independence;
- respect security and privacy requirements;
- document significant architectural changes;
- evolve through RFC and ADR processes.

Architecture evolution should remain understandable for contributors and
maintainers.

---

# Architecture Governance

FamilyOS architecture governance ensures that architectural decisions remain
consistent over time.

Governance activities include:

- architecture reviews;
- RFC evaluation;
- ADR documentation;
- dependency validation;
- boundary verification;
- architectural consistency checks.

Changes affecting architecture relationships or responsibilities should be
reviewed before implementation.
