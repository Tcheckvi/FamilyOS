# Release Framework

## 19 Release Security

### Overview

EPIC-REL-001 — Release Framework defines Release Security as the set of architectural, operational, and governance controls used to protect FamilyOS releases from unauthorized, unintended, ambiguous, or malicious modification.

Release security applies across the entire release lifecycle.

It does not begin only when artifacts are published.

The protected release chain includes:

```text
Source
  ↓
Build
  ↓
Candidate
  ↓
Validation
  ↓
Approval
  ↓
Version
  ↓
Tag
  ↓
Publication
  ↓
Distribution
```

A weakness at any stage may compromise trust in the final release.

Release Security therefore protects:

* source integrity;
* candidate identity;
* release credentials;
* build environments;
* CI/CD workflows;
* release approvals;
* artifact integrity;
* provenance;
* tags;
* publication targets;
* distribution channels;
* release evidence;
* historical release identity.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of Release Security is to establish requirements for:

* release trust boundaries;
* identity and authentication;
* authorization;
* least privilege;
* release credentials;
* secret handling;
* source integrity;
* repository protection;
* branch protection;
* tag protection;
* CI/CD security;
* runner trust;
* dependency security;
* candidate integrity;
* artifact integrity;
* provenance protection;
* release signing;
* software supply-chain security;
* publication authority;
* distribution security;
* security evidence;
* incident response;
* release withdrawal;
* emergency security releases.

The objective is to ensure that an official FamilyOS release can be trusted not only because it passed functional validation, but because the release path itself was sufficiently protected.

---

## Core Security Principle

The central principle is:

> A release is trustworthy only when both its contents and the process that produced and published those contents are trustworthy.

The following is insufficient:

```text
tests passed
```

if:

```text
release credentials were compromised
```

or:

```text
published artifacts were replaced
```

or:

```text
the release tag was moved
```

or:

```text
the candidate provenance cannot be established
```

Release security must therefore protect both software correctness and release integrity.

---

## Security Scope

Release Security covers the following domains:

```text
Release Security
├── Source Security
├── Repository Security
├── CI/CD Security
├── Credential Security
├── Candidate Security
├── Artifact Security
├── Provenance Security
├── Dependency Security
├── Approval Security
├── Tag Security
├── Publication Security
├── Distribution Security
├── Evidence Security
└── Recovery Security
```

These domains interact.

No single control is sufficient by itself.

---

## Security Objectives

FamilyOS Release Security has the following primary objectives.

### Confidentiality

Sensitive release information must be protected where disclosure could create security risk.

Examples include:

* release credentials;
* private signing keys;
* undisclosed vulnerability details;
* restricted security release metadata.

---

### Integrity

Release-related data and artifacts must be protected against unauthorized modification.

This includes:

* source;
* candidate artifacts;
* release metadata;
* checksums;
* provenance;
* tags;
* release notes where security-sensitive;
* distribution aliases.

---

### Authenticity

The release system should provide confidence that release operations were performed by authorized identities.

---

### Authorization

Only explicitly authorized actors or automation should be able to perform privileged release operations.

---

### Traceability

Security-relevant release activity should remain attributable and reconstructable.

---

### Availability

Release systems should remain sufficiently available to support release and recovery operations.

Availability failure must not cause insecure bypass.

---

## Trust Model

Release security relies on a chain of trust.

Conceptually:

```text
Trusted Maintainer / Automation
        ↓
Trusted Repository State
        ↓
Trusted Build Environment
        ↓
Trusted Candidate
        ↓
Trusted Validation
        ↓
Authorized Approval
        ↓
Protected Publication
        ↓
Verified Consumer Artifact
```

Trust in the final release depends on the integrity of this chain.

---

## Trust Boundaries

Release operations cross several trust boundaries.

Typical boundaries include:

```text
developer workstation
        ↓
source repository
        ↓
CI/CD platform
        ↓
artifact storage
        ↓
publication registry
        ↓
distribution system
        ↓
consumer
```

Crossing a boundary may require:

* authentication;
* authorization;
* integrity verification;
* provenance verification;
* audit evidence.

---

## Threat Model

FamilyOS release security must consider threats such as:

* unauthorized source modification;
* compromised maintainer account;
* stolen release credentials;
* malicious CI/CD workflow change;
* compromised runner;
* dependency substitution;
* artifact replacement;
* candidate mutation;
* tag manipulation;
* unauthorized release approval;
* package registry compromise;
* release metadata tampering;
* malicious or accidental channel promotion;
* provenance falsification;
* secret disclosure;
* supply-chain attack.

The framework should evolve as the threat model matures.

---

## Release Identity Security

Every privileged release operation should identify the release or candidate being affected.

A release operation must not ambiguously target:

```text
latest
```

when an explicit immutable version or candidate can be used.

The preferred model is:

```text
candidate: 5.2.0-rc.3
release: 5.2.0
```

This reduces accidental operation against the wrong release state.

---

## Human Identity

Privileged human release actions should originate from identifiable authorized accounts.

Shared anonymous accounts should be avoided for sensitive operations.

Identity should support determining:

```text
who performed the action
```

without relying only on informal team knowledge.

---

## Automation Identity

Release automation should also have identifiable identities.

Examples include:

* release bot;
* CI service account;
* workload identity;
* dedicated publication identity.

Automation actions should not appear indistinguishable from arbitrary users where platform capabilities allow stronger attribution.

---

## Authentication

Privileged release systems must require appropriate authentication.

Authentication strength should reflect the sensitivity of operations.

Examples may include:

* strong account credentials;
* multi-factor authentication;
* hardware-backed authentication;
* short-lived workload identity.

The exact mechanism may evolve.

---

## Multi-Factor Authentication

Maintainer accounts with direct release publication authority SHOULD use multi-factor authentication where supported.

This is especially important for:

* repository administration;
* package publication;
* signing systems;
* secret management.

---

## Authorization

Authentication establishes identity.

Authorization determines allowed release actions.

The framework must distinguish these concepts.

An authenticated user MUST NOT automatically receive release publication authority.

---

## Least Privilege

Release systems MUST follow least privilege.

Each actor or automation should receive only the capabilities required for its responsibilities.

Conceptually:

```text
validate
approve
tag
publish
promote
withdraw
```

may represent separate privileges.

---

## Separation of Duties

Higher-risk release profiles SHOULD support separation between critical responsibilities where practical.

For example:

```text
candidate creator
        ≠
release approver
```

or:

```text
validator
        ≠
publisher
```

Separation may reduce the risk of a single compromised identity controlling the complete release chain.

---

## Small-Team Governance

FamilyOS may initially have a small maintainer group.

Strict organizational separation may therefore not always be practical.

Even when one maintainer performs multiple roles, the roles should remain conceptually explicit.

This preserves a path toward stronger governance later.

---

## Privileged Release Operations

Sensitive operations include:

* creating stable release tags;
* publishing artifacts;
* promoting stable channels;
* signing releases;
* withdrawing releases;
* changing release permissions;
* modifying protected pipeline definitions.

These operations should receive stronger controls than ordinary development operations.

---

## Release Credentials

Release credentials include any secret or identity capable of performing privileged release operations.

Examples include:

* API tokens;
* package registry credentials;
* repository tokens;
* signing keys;
* cloud credentials;
* deployment credentials;
* private certificates.

---

## Credential Principle

The central credential rule is:

> Release credentials must never become ordinary project data.

Credentials MUST NOT be stored directly in:

* source files;
* committed configuration;
* documentation;
* shell scripts;
* release notes;
* generated artifacts.

---

## Secret Storage

Release secrets should be stored using an appropriate secret-management capability.

Potential implementations include:

* CI/CD secret stores;
* operating system keychains;
* cloud secret managers;
* dedicated vault systems.

The Release Framework does not require one provider.

---

## Credential Scope

Credentials should be narrowly scoped.

For example:

```text
validation identity
→ read-only

package publishing identity
→ package publication only

repository tagging identity
→ release references only
```

Broad administrative credentials should not be used where narrower credentials are available.

---

## Credential Lifetime

Short-lived credentials SHOULD be preferred for high-value release operations where supported.

Advantages include:

* smaller exposure window;
* improved revocation;
* reduced persistent secret storage;
* stronger workload identity.

---

## Credential Rotation

Long-lived release credentials must be rotatable.

Rotation should be planned before compromise occurs.

A release process that cannot rotate publication credentials safely creates operational security risk.

---

## Credential Revocation

When a credential is suspected of compromise:

```text
revoke
      ↓
assess exposure
      ↓
replace
      ↓
verify publication integrity
```

should occur according to security incident policy.

---

## Credential Logging

Release credentials MUST NOT appear in logs.

Automation should redact:

* tokens;
* passwords;
* private keys;
* signed secret material;
* sensitive environment variables.

---

## Environment Variables

Environment variables may be used to inject release credentials.

However, they must still be protected from:

* debug output;
* process listings where relevant;
* child process leakage;
* crash reports;
* artifact collection.

---

## Source Security

Release security begins with source integrity.

The candidate source must originate from the expected repository and revision.

Relevant controls may include:

* protected branches;
* code review;
* signed commits;
* commit identity;
* repository access control.

---

## Repository Protection

The authoritative repository is a critical release security boundary.

Controls SHOULD protect:

* release branches;
* release tags;
* administrative settings;
* CI/CD workflow files;
* secret configuration.

---

## Branch Protection

Release-relevant branches SHOULD use appropriate protections.

Possible controls include:

* restricted direct push;
* required reviews;
* required status checks;
* force-push restrictions;
* deletion restrictions.

The exact policy depends on repository maturity.

---

## Force Push Security

Force-pushing release history can undermine traceability.

Protected release branches SHOULD prevent casual history rewriting.

---

## Tag Protection

Official release tags SHOULD receive strong protection.

Controls may restrict:

* creation;
* deletion;
* movement;
* overwrite.

A stable release tag is part of release integrity.

---

## Tag Security Principle

The relationship:

```text
official tag
→ exact release commit
```

must remain trustworthy.

Unauthorized movement of an official tag should be treated as a release security incident.

---

## Signed Tags

Future FamilyOS security policy MAY require cryptographically signed release tags.

Signed tags can help verify that the release reference was created by a trusted signing identity.

They do not replace:

* release validation;
* approval;
* artifact signing;
* provenance.

---

## Signed Commits

Release commits MAY eventually require signatures for high-assurance release profiles.

Signed commits can strengthen source identity.

The signing trust model must still define trusted keys or identities.

---

## CI/CD Security

CI/CD infrastructure is part of the release supply chain.

A compromised pipeline can alter release artifacts even when source code is correct.

Release CI/CD therefore requires strong security controls.

---

## Pipeline Definition Security

Release-critical pipeline definitions should be version-controlled and reviewed.

A change such as:

```text
publish from another branch
```

or:

```text
disable checksum verification
```

can change release security materially.

Pipeline modifications must not be treated as harmless configuration changes.

---

## Workflow Review

High-impact workflow changes SHOULD receive appropriate review before they can affect official releases.

---

## Trusted Runners

Privileged release jobs should run on trusted environments.

Untrusted runners MUST NOT receive:

* release secrets;
* signing keys;
* stable publication authority.

---

## Ephemeral Runners

Ephemeral runners SHOULD be preferred for sensitive release workflows where practical.

Benefits include:

* reduced persistent compromise;
* cleaner state;
* lower secret retention;
* reduced cross-release contamination.

---

## Runner Isolation

Release environments should isolate jobs from unrelated workloads where appropriate.

Shared mutable environments create opportunities for:

* secret theft;
* artifact replacement;
* dependency contamination.

---

## Untrusted Contributions

Code originating from untrusted contributions must be isolated from privileged release credentials.

For example, pull request code MUST NOT normally execute with stable publication credentials.

---

## Pipeline Trigger Security

Release workflows must validate who or what may trigger privileged jobs.

The existence of a matching Git tag or branch name must not by itself provide unconditional publication authority.

---

## Pipeline Dependency Security

Release pipelines may depend on:

* third-party actions;
* plugins;
* scripts;
* container images;
* package managers.

These dependencies form part of the release supply chain.

They SHOULD be version-controlled or pinned appropriately.

---

## Mutable Pipeline Dependency Risk

A release workflow depending on mutable references such as:

```text
third-party-action@latest
```

may unexpectedly change behavior.

Release-critical dependencies SHOULD use controlled versions where practical.

---

## Candidate Security

A Release Candidate must be protected against unauthorized or ambiguous mutation.

Security objectives include:

* source identity preservation;
* artifact stability;
* configuration stability;
* dependency integrity;
* evidence binding.

---

## Candidate Mutation

A material candidate change after validation begins should be visible and trigger requalification.

Silent candidate mutation is both a validation failure and a security concern.

---

## Candidate Access Control

Candidate artifact stores should prevent unauthorized replacement.

Where candidate artifacts are promoted directly to stable release, candidate storage becomes a critical trust boundary.

---

## Candidate Digest

Checksums or digests SHOULD identify candidate artifacts where practical.

This helps detect replacement between:

```text
validation
```

and:

```text
publication
```

---

## Artifact Security

Release artifacts are the consumer-facing outputs of the release process.

They must be protected against:

* unauthorized replacement;
* tampering;
* wrong-version publication;
* malicious injection;
* corrupted transfer.

---

## Artifact Integrity

Cryptographic digests SHOULD be used for significant packaged artifacts where practical.

Example:

```text
SHA-256
```

or another approved secure algorithm.

---

## Integrity Verification

The preferred relationship is:

```text
candidate digest
=
publication digest
=
consumer artifact digest
```

where technically possible.

---

## Artifact Signing

FamilyOS MAY introduce artifact signing as release security matures.

Signing can establish stronger authenticity and integrity than checksums alone.

---

## Signing Key Security

Private signing keys are highly privileged release assets.

They must be protected using controls appropriate to their importance.

Potential mechanisms include:

* hardware-backed keys;
* managed signing service;
* protected secret store;
* short-lived keyless signing.

---

## Signing Authority

Governance must define who or what may sign official FamilyOS releases.

The existence of a signing key must not automatically establish release approval.

---

## Signature Verification

Where signing is required, release validation and consumer tooling should support signature verification.

A signature without a defined trust model provides limited assurance.

---

## Provenance Security

Provenance itself is security-sensitive.

An attacker able to rewrite provenance may make a malicious artifact appear legitimate.

Provenance records should therefore be protected against unauthorized mutation.

---

## Provenance Binding

A strong provenance record binds:

```text
source revision
build identity
artifact digest
candidate
release version
```

This relationship should be difficult to alter silently.

---

## Signed Provenance

Future FamilyOS releases MAY use cryptographically signed provenance or attestations.

This provides stronger evidence that provenance claims originated from trusted release infrastructure.

---

## Supply-Chain Provenance

FamilyOS should progressively support standards-compatible supply-chain provenance.

Possible future technologies may include:

* SLSA-style provenance;
* in-toto-style attestations;
* Sigstore-compatible signing.

Specific adoption requires dedicated implementation decisions.

---

## Dependency Security

Release artifacts often depend on external packages.

Dependency compromise can affect a release without direct modification to FamilyOS source.

Release security must therefore consider dependency integrity.

---

## Dependency Locking

Applicable releases SHOULD use controlled dependency resolution.

Potential mechanisms include:

* lockfiles;
* exact versions;
* package hashes;
* reproducible environment definitions.

---

## Dependency Drift

A build using:

```text
dependency version A
```

during validation and:

```text
dependency version B
```

during publication may produce different artifacts.

Dependency drift must be prevented or captured through renewed provenance and validation.

---

## Dependency Verification

Future release policies may verify:

* package checksum;
* registry origin;
* signature;
* known vulnerability state.

The required depth depends on release risk.

---

## Software Bill of Materials

An SBOM can improve security visibility by recording release dependencies.

FamilyOS MAY progressively require SBOM generation for significant executable releases.

---

## Vulnerability Management

Release Security should integrate with vulnerability detection.

Relevant sources may include:

* dependency vulnerability scanners;
* static security analysis;
* secret scanning;
* software composition analysis.

Findings must be classified by release policy.

---

## Critical Vulnerability

A known critical vulnerability affecting the candidate SHOULD normally block stable publication unless exceptional governance explicitly determines otherwise.

Some security controls may be defined as non-exceptionable.

---

## Security Findings

Security findings may be classified as:

```text
INFO
LOW
MEDIUM
HIGH
CRITICAL
```

or another governed severity model.

The severity model must remain explicit.

---

## Security Blocking Policy

The release profile should define which security findings block publication.

Example:

```text
CRITICAL
→ BLOCK

HIGH
→ BLOCK or explicit security exception

MEDIUM
→ risk evaluation
```

This is illustrative rather than a universal threshold.

---

## Secret Scanning

Release readiness and validation SHOULD include secret exposure checks where applicable.

Secrets accidentally committed into the release source may require:

* credential revocation;
* source cleanup;
* incident assessment;
* candidate invalidation.

Removing the secret from a later commit alone may not eliminate exposure.

---

## Approval Security

Release approval is a privileged governance decision.

Approval records should be protected against unauthorized creation or modification.

---

## Approval Binding

Approval must bind to:

```text
candidate
release version intent
release scope
```

An approval must not automatically apply to a materially changed candidate.

---

## Approval Replay

A previously valid approval must not be replayed against a different release state.

Material candidate change invalidates approval.

---

## Approval Audit

A privileged release should be able to identify:

* approver;
* candidate;
* approval time;
* accepted exceptions;
* risk acceptance.

---

## Publication Security

Publication systems represent one of the highest-impact release security boundaries.

A compromised publication path can distribute malicious artifacts to consumers.

---

## Publication Authorization

Only authorized identities may publish official releases.

This applies to:

* Git tags;
* package registries;
* plugin registries;
* documentation publishing;
* release metadata;
* stable channels.

---

## Registry Security

Package and artifact registries should use controls such as:

* scoped publish permissions;
* MFA where appropriate;
* immutable releases;
* audit logs;
* token rotation;
* namespace protection.

---

## Namespace Security

Official FamilyOS package and plugin namespaces should be protected from:

* impersonation;
* dependency confusion;
* unauthorized registration;
* naming collision.

---

## Dependency Confusion

FamilyOS should consider the risk of dependency confusion when package names may resolve from public and private registries.

Release tooling should use explicit repository configuration where appropriate.

---

## Publication Target Verification

Before publication, tooling should verify that the intended target is correct.

Publishing an official package to the wrong registry may create both operational and security incidents.

---

## Typographical Target Errors

Publication configuration should avoid relying on manually typed high-impact URLs or namespaces where deterministic configured targets are possible.

---

## Publication Immutability

Official package versions should be immutable.

A registry that allows replacement should still be governed to prohibit silent overwrite.

---

## Channel Security

Mutable aliases such as:

```text
stable
latest
current
```

are high-impact controls.

Unauthorized mutation could redirect consumers to malicious or defective releases.

Channel promotion authority must therefore be protected.

---

## Stable Channel Protection

Stable channel changes SHOULD require stronger authorization than development channel changes.

---

## Distribution Security

Distribution systems must preserve official artifact identity.

Mirrors and caches must not alter immutable release content under the same version.

---

## Transport Security

Release artifacts SHOULD be distributed through secure transport mechanisms appropriate to the environment.

Transport security reduces interception and modification risk.

Artifact-level integrity still remains valuable.

---

## Consumer Verification

Future FamilyOS tooling SHOULD allow consumers to verify:

* version;
* checksum;
* signature;
* provenance;
* official origin.

This reduces reliance solely on transport trust.

---

## Security of Release Notes

Release communication may contain security-sensitive information.

Release notes must not disclose:

* unpatched vulnerability details;
* secrets;
* credentials;
* sensitive infrastructure information;

unless disclosure is deliberate and governed.

---

## Coordinated Security Release

A security release may require coordinated timing between:

```text
fixed artifact
security advisory
release notes
stable promotion
public disclosure
```

The release workflow must support these synchronized transitions.

---

## Embargoed Release Information

Security release preparation may involve embargoed information.

Access should be restricted to authorized participants until disclosure.

---

## Security Advisory Integrity

Security advisories should accurately identify:

* affected versions;
* fixed versions;
* mitigation;
* severity;
* release status.

Incorrect advisory versioning can cause consumers to remain vulnerable.

---

## Release Evidence Security

Release evidence may influence later security investigations.

Evidence should therefore be protected from unauthorized modification.

Examples include:

* validation reports;
* checksums;
* provenance;
* approval records;
* publication records.

---

## Evidence Confidentiality

Some release evidence may contain sensitive information.

Not all evidence needs to be publicly accessible.

The framework should distinguish:

```text
public release evidence
```

from:

```text
restricted security evidence
```

---

## Audit Logs

Privileged release systems SHOULD retain suitable audit logs.

Useful information includes:

* actor;
* action;
* release;
* target;
* result;
* time.

Audit logs must avoid secret disclosure.

---

## Tamper Resistance

Higher-maturity release infrastructure should progressively strengthen tamper resistance for:

* release evidence;
* signatures;
* provenance;
* publication metadata.

---

## Security Incident Definition

A Release Security Incident is any event that creates credible uncertainty about release integrity, authenticity, authorization, or confidentiality.

Examples include:

* compromised release credential;
* unauthorized tag movement;
* incorrect package replacement;
* compromised CI runner;
* false provenance;
* leaked signing key;
* unauthorized stable promotion.

---

## Security Incident Response

A release security incident should trigger a controlled process.

Conceptually:

```text
DETECT
  ↓
CONTAIN
  ↓
ASSESS
  ↓
REVOKE / PROTECT
  ↓
VERIFY RELEASES
  ↓
WITHDRAW IF NECESSARY
  ↓
RECOVER
  ↓
DOCUMENT
```

---

## Credential Compromise

When release credentials are compromised, the response should include:

* revoke credential;
* replace credential;
* review audit history;
* inspect release operations performed during exposure;
* verify affected tags and artifacts;
* withdraw suspicious releases where necessary.

---

## Signing Key Compromise

Signing key compromise has especially serious implications.

Response may include:

* immediate key revocation;
* new signing identity;
* affected release assessment;
* consumer communication;
* re-signing policy where applicable.

Key compromise handling must be defined before signing becomes mandatory.

---

## CI/CD Compromise

A compromised release pipeline may require reassessment of every release produced during the suspected compromise window.

Release evidence should enable identifying those releases.

---

## Repository Compromise

If unauthorized repository modification is detected, release tags and commits must be verified against trusted evidence.

Historical release integrity may need re-establishment.

---

## Registry Compromise

If a package or artifact registry is compromised, FamilyOS should verify:

```text
expected release metadata
expected artifact digest
expected version history
```

against independent release evidence.

---

## Release Withdrawal

If release integrity cannot be trusted, the release may need to be withdrawn.

Withdrawal should preserve historical identity while preventing normal consumption.

---

## Security Withdrawal Example

```text
Release 5.2.0
Status: WITHDRAWN

Reason:
artifact integrity cannot be established

Replacement:
5.2.1
```

---

## Security Supersession

A corrected security release should receive a new immutable version.

Example:

```text
5.2.0
compromised / vulnerable

5.2.1
corrected
```

The defective release must not be silently overwritten.

---

## Emergency Security Release

Security incidents may require accelerated release.

The core principle remains:

> Fast security release does not mean insecure release.

Minimum controls should include:

* controlled source;
* candidate identity;
* focused validation;
* security approval;
* version integrity;
* artifact verification;
* publication authorization;
* consumer guidance;
* recovery capability.

---

## Break-Glass Access

Future governance MAY define break-glass privileges for exceptional emergencies.

Break-glass access must be:

* limited;
* logged;
* explicitly activated;
* reviewed after use;
* revoked when no longer needed.

It must not become a routine release mechanism.

---

## Security Exceptions

Security requirements may permit exceptions only where policy explicitly allows them.

An exception should identify:

```text
security control
reason
risk
approver
compensating controls
scope
expiration
```

---

## Non-Exceptionable Security Controls

Some controls may become non-exceptionable.

Potential examples include:

* known compromised release credential;
* conflicting immutable artifact identity;
* known tag identity conflict;
* inability to establish source identity.

The exact policy belongs to Release Governance and Security Governance.

---

## Release Security Profiles

Different release types may require different security controls.

Possible profiles include:

```text
documentation-release-security
framework-release-security
plugin-release-security
platform-release-security
security-release
emergency-security-release
```

Profiles may add requirements.

Core security invariants must remain common.

---

## Framework Release Security

A FamilyOS documentation framework release may focus on:

```text
repository identity
branch state
release commit
tag integrity
publication authority
remote verification
```

Traditional binary signing may not be necessary.

---

## Plugin Release Security

Plugin releases may additionally require:

* artifact checksums;
* plugin package integrity;
* platform compatibility;
* dependency security;
* compliance evidence;
* registry authorization.

---

## Platform Release Security

A full platform release may require the strongest controls, including:

* build provenance;
* dependency verification;
* artifact signing;
* SBOM;
* restricted publication;
* multi-stage validation;
* strong approval;
* channel protection.

---

## Documentation Release Security

Documentation release security should protect against:

* malicious link insertion;
* altered security guidance;
* incorrect release versions;
* publication takeover.

Documentation may influence security-sensitive operational behavior.

---

## Security Release Security

Security releases may require:

* restricted preparation;
* confidential issue tracking;
* limited candidate visibility;
* controlled disclosure;
* protected artifact handling;
* coordinated publication.

---

## Release Security Validation

Before publication, the release process should evaluate security readiness.

Example:

```text
Source Integrity          PASS
Repository Protection     PASS
Candidate Integrity       PASS
Dependency Security       PASS
Secrets                   PASS
Artifact Integrity        PASS
Provenance                PASS
Approval                  PASS
Publication Authority     PASS
Credential Security       PASS

SECURITY VALIDATION       PASS
```

---

## Security Evidence

A release security evidence set may include:

```text
security scan results
secret scan results
dependency assessment
artifact checksums
provenance verification
approval evidence
credential identity
publication audit records
```

Evidence requirements should scale with release risk.

---

## Security Automation

Deterministic security checks should be automated where practical.

Examples include:

* secret scanning;
* dependency scanning;
* checksum verification;
* signature verification;
* tag verification;
* protected branch checks.

Automation must not hide security findings.

---

## Security Automation Failure

Security checks that cannot execute must not automatically be treated as passing.

Possible outcomes include:

```text
BLOCKED
```

or:

```text
EXCEPTION_REQUIRED
```

according to policy.

---

## Release Security Observability

Security-sensitive release state should be observable.

Potential events include:

```text
release.security.validation.started
release.security.validation.failed
release.credential.used
release.signature.created
release.integrity.failed
release.security.withdrawal.started
```

Event details must avoid secret leakage.

---

## Security Metrics

Future FamilyOS release security metrics may include:

* security finding count;
* secret exposure incidents;
* credential age;
* signing coverage;
* provenance coverage;
* artifact integrity failures;
* unauthorized release attempts;
* security withdrawal frequency.

Metrics should support risk reduction, not superficial compliance.

---

## Release Security Maturity

FamilyOS may evolve through the following release security maturity levels.

```text
Level 1
controlled repository and manual release authority

Level 2
protected credentials and repository checks

## Supply-Chain Security Vision

The long-term FamilyOS goal is a release chain in which a consumer can establish:

```text
official source
      ↓
authorized build
      ↓
identified artifact
      ↓
validated candidate
      ↓
authorized release
      ↓
verified publication
      ↓
trusted artifact
```

This represents mature end-to-end release trust.

---

## Security by Default

Release tooling should make secure behavior the default.

Examples include:

```text
refuse conflicting tag
refuse checksum mismatch
refuse unapproved stable publication
refuse missing candidate identity
refuse accidental secret logging
```

Unsafe overrides should require explicit governance where allowed.

---

## Fail Closed

When a critical security property cannot be established, release tooling SHOULD fail closed.

For example:

```text
cannot verify artifact integrity
→ BLOCK
```

rather than:

```text
cannot verify artifact integrity
→ continue silently
```

---

## Security Usability

Security controls must remain usable enough to be followed consistently.

Overly complicated release controls may encourage manual bypass.

The framework should seek:

```text
strong protection
+
clear workflow
+
automation
```

rather than unnecessary ceremony.

---

## Security Documentation

Security-sensitive release procedures should be documented.

This includes:

* credential use;
* emergency access;
* signing;
* withdrawal;
* security release process;
* incident recovery.

Sensitive secrets themselves must never appear in documentation.

---

## Release Security Review

High-impact changes to release security architecture SHOULD receive review.

Examples include:

* changing signing authority;
* changing publication credentials;
* weakening protected tag rules;
* changing release runner trust;
* modifying supply-chain provenance behavior.

---

## Security Architecture Evolution

Security requirements will evolve.

New capabilities may introduce:

* hardware security modules;
* keyless signing;
* transparency logs;
* policy engines;
* attestations;
* trusted build services.

These improvements should strengthen the existing Release Security model without redefining core release identity.

---

## Security Invariants

The following invariants apply.

### SEC1 — Privileged release actions require explicit authorization.

### SEC2 — Release credentials must not be committed to source or documentation.

### SEC3 — Least privilege applies to human and automated release identities.

### SEC4 — Candidate and artifact integrity must be protected.

### SEC5 — Official release tags must be protected against unauthorized mutation.

### SEC6 — Untrusted workloads must not receive privileged release credentials.

### SEC7 — Published immutable release artifacts must not be silently replaced.

### SEC8 — Security validation must correspond to the actual release candidate.

### SEC9 — Release provenance must not be treated as trustworthy if it can be silently altered.

### SEC10 — Security incidents affecting release trust must be investigated and recorded.

### SEC11 — Compromised release identity may require withdrawal or corrective release.

### SEC12 — Security semantics remain independent from specific security vendors or CI/CD providers.

---

## Security Anti-Patterns

### Shared Release Token

Using one unrestricted token for every release operation and every maintainer.

---

### Secrets in Repository

Committing registry tokens or private signing keys.

---

### Privileged Pull Request Pipeline

Providing stable release credentials to untrusted contribution jobs.

---

### Mutable Official Tag

Allowing an official release tag to be moved after publication.

---

### Unsigned Trust Assumption

Assuming an artifact is authentic solely because its filename and version look correct.

---

### Pipeline Trust by Default

Assuming every CI runner is trusted simply because it belongs to the CI platform.

---

### Dependency Latest

Using uncontrolled mutable dependency versions in release-critical workflows.

---

### Security Scan Means Security

Treating one automated scanner as proof that the complete release process is secure.

---

### Silent Security Exception

Ignoring failed security controls without formal risk acceptance.

---

### Compromise Without Historical Review

Rotating a credential after compromise without determining which releases may have been affected.

---

## Minimum Release Security Requirements

At minimum, a FamilyOS official release should establish:

```text
controlled source identity
authorized release actor
protected release credentials
release version identity
tag integrity
candidate identity
applicable artifact integrity
secure publication authority
release evidence
```

Applicable executable releases should additionally consider dependency and artifact security.

---

## Minimum Framework Release Security

For current FamilyOS framework releases, the minimum practical security model should include:

```text
known repository
controlled branch
known HEAD
clean release state
authorized commit
annotated official tag
tag target verification
authoritative remote verification
protected repository credentials
```

This provides a strong baseline without requiring premature signing infrastructure.

---

## Target Release Security Experience

At higher maturity, a release security report may look like:

```text
FamilyOS Release Security

Release               6.0.0
Candidate             6.0.0-rc.2

Source Identity        VERIFIED
Repository Protection  PASS
Candidate Integrity    PASS
Dependencies           PASS
Secrets                PASS
Artifacts              VERIFIED
Provenance             VERIFIED
Signatures             VERIFIED
Approval Identity      VERIFIED
Publication Authority  VERIFIED
Stable Channel         PROTECTED

Critical Findings      0
High Findings          0

SECURITY STATUS        PASS
```

---

## Target Consumer Security Experience

A consumer should eventually be able to answer:

```text
Is this an official FamilyOS release?

Is this artifact the expected artifact?

Has the artifact been modified?

Which source state produced it?

Was it released through an authorized FamilyOS process?
```

The framework should progressively make these answers independently verifiable.

## Relationship With Release Architecture

`04-Release-Architecture.md` defines the release domains and trust boundaries.

This document applies security controls across those boundaries.

---

## Relationship With Release Lifecycle

```text
VALIDATED → APPROVED
APPROVED → RELEASED
RELEASED → PUBLISHED
```

Release Security protects the identities and permissions controlling those transitions.

---

---

## Relationship With Release Governance

`21-Release-Governance.md` defines who may authorize sensitive release actions and approve security exceptions.

---

## Relationship With Release Compliance

`22-Release-Compliance.md` may evaluate whether required release security controls were applied.

---

## Relationship With Release Risk Management

`24-Release-Risk-Management.md` evaluates security risks together with other release risks and governs acceptance where permitted.

---

## Final Statement

The FamilyOS Release Security model establishes security as an end-to-end property of release engineering.

It protects source identity, candidates, artifacts, provenance, credentials, CI/CD environments, approvals, repository tags, publication targets, distribution channels, and release evidence.

A secure release is not simply software that passed a vulnerability scanner.

It is a release whose complete path from controlled source to consumer-facing artifact remains sufficiently authenticated, authorized, traceable, integrity-protected, and recoverable.

By establishing these controls early, FamilyOS creates the foundation for progressively stronger software supply-chain security without coupling the Release Framework to one security technology or provider.
