# Release Framework

## 09 Release Readiness

### Overview

EPIC-REL-001 — Release Framework defines Release Readiness as the formal determination that a prepared FamilyOS release is sufficiently complete, stable, understood, and controlled to enter release candidate qualification.

Release Readiness answers a fundamental question:

> Is this release ready to become a formal release candidate?

Readiness occurs after Release Planning and preparation, but before candidate creation and final release validation.

It provides the transition between:

```text
PREPARED
   ↓
READY
```

A release must not enter formal candidate qualification merely because implementation work appears complete.

It must demonstrate that all applicable prerequisites for candidate creation have been satisfied.

---

## Purpose

The Release Readiness model establishes:

* readiness criteria;
* readiness domains;
* readiness gates;
* readiness evidence;
* readiness evaluation;
* blocking conditions;
* exception handling;
* readiness ownership;
* readiness reassessment;
* release profile integration;
* automation expectations.

The objective is to prevent incomplete or unstable release states from entering final qualification.

---

## Readiness Principle

The central principle is:

> Candidate qualification begins only after release readiness has been demonstrated.

Readiness is not based on confidence alone.

It must be supported by observable conditions and evidence.

The following is insufficient:

```text
development appears finished
```

The required model is:

```text
release requirements identified
        ↓
applicable readiness checks executed
        ↓
evidence evaluated
        ↓
blocking conditions resolved
        ↓
READY
```

---

## Lifecycle Position

Release Readiness governs the transition:

```text
PREPARED
   ↓
READY
```

The broader lifecycle is:

```text
PLANNED
   ↓
PREPARED
   ↓
[ RELEASE READINESS GATE ]
   ↓
READY
   ↓
CANDIDATE
   ↓
VALIDATED
```

Readiness therefore protects the candidate boundary.

---

## Prepared vs Ready

`PREPARED` and `READY` represent different states.

A prepared release means:

* release scope is understood;
* planning exists;
* expected validation is known;
* release materials are being assembled.

A ready release means:

* applicable prerequisites have actually been satisfied;
* no unresolved blocking condition prevents candidate creation;
* evidence exists to support progression.

Conceptually:

```text
PREPARED
requirements known

READY
requirements satisfied
```

---

## Readiness vs Release Validation

Release Readiness and Release Validation MUST remain distinct.

Readiness asks:

> Can this release enter final candidate qualification?

Release Validation asks:

> Has this exact release candidate demonstrated that it is suitable for release?

The relationship is:

```text
Release Readiness
        ↓
candidate may be created
        ↓
Release Candidate
        ↓
Release Validation
        ↓
candidate may be approved
```

---

## Readiness Scope

Readiness may evaluate several domains.

The canonical readiness domains are:

```text
Scope
Repository
Build
Testing
Quality
Security
Compliance
Documentation
Dependencies
Compatibility
Configuration
Artifacts
Versioning
Risk
Governance
Recovery
Publication
```

Not every release profile requires every domain.

Applicable domains must be explicitly determined.

---

## Readiness Profile

A Release Readiness Profile defines the checks required for a particular release.

Examples include:

```text
framework-release
plugin-release
platform-release
documentation-release
maintenance-release
security-release
emergency-release
```

Profiles prevent every release from applying an identical checklist regardless of scope or risk.

---

## Profile Principle

Release profiles may vary requirements.

They must not weaken universal release invariants.

For example, a documentation-only release may not require executable build validation.

However, it still requires:

* release identity;
* repository traceability;
* documentation validation;
* version consistency;
* release governance;
* publication planning.

---

## Readiness Evaluation Model

A readiness evaluation should produce an explicit result.

Canonical outcomes are:

```text
READY
BLOCKED
EXCEPTION_REQUIRED
```

A release should not remain in an ambiguous state such as:

```text
probably ready
```

or:

```text
ready enough
```

---

## READY

`READY` means:

* all mandatory readiness requirements passed;
* required evidence exists;
* no blocking condition remains;
* required exceptions are approved;
* candidate creation may proceed.

---

## BLOCKED

`BLOCKED` means:

* at least one mandatory readiness requirement failed;
* required evidence is missing;
* unresolved release risk prevents progression;
* required approval is unavailable;
* release state is inconsistent.

A blocked release MUST NOT become a formal release candidate.

---

## EXCEPTION_REQUIRED

`EXCEPTION_REQUIRED` means:

* a requirement is not satisfied;
* policy allows an exception path;
* explicit authority must decide whether progression is acceptable.

Until the exception is approved:

```text
release state != READY
```

---

## Readiness Gate

The Release Readiness Gate combines applicable readiness domains.

Conceptually:

```text
Scope                 PASS
Repository            PASS
Build                 PASS
Testing               PASS
Quality               PASS
Security              PASS
Compliance            PASS
Documentation         PASS
Dependencies          PASS
Compatibility         PASS
Configuration         PASS
Version               PASS
Risk                   ACCEPTABLE
Governance             PASS
Recovery               PASS
Publication            PASS
--------------------------------
RELEASE READINESS      PASS
```

The exact set depends on release profile.

---

## Scope Readiness

Scope readiness verifies that the release scope is sufficiently defined and stable.

Checks may include:

* release subject identified;
* in-scope components identified;
* out-of-scope work understood;
* unintended changes absent;
* release type selected;
* target channel selected where applicable.

A release with uncertain scope is not ready.

---

## Scope Readiness Example

```text
Release Subject        Release Framework
Release Type           Framework
Target Channel         Stable
Scope Defined          PASS
Unexpected Changes     NONE
Scope Stability        PASS
```

---

## Repository Readiness

Repository readiness verifies that the source repository is in an acceptable state for candidate creation.

Checks may include:

* expected branch;
* intended source revision;
* no unintended modifications;
* no unresolved merge conflict;
* required files tracked;
* repository structure valid;
* required baseline synchronized where applicable.

---

## Repository Cleanliness

For release profiles requiring a clean working tree:

```text
git status --short
```

should produce no unexpected changes.

A dirty working tree may indicate:

* uncommitted release content;
* accidental local modifications;
* generated files;
* missing candidate source identity.

Such conditions must be resolved or explicitly governed.

---

## Repository Identity

The release process should know the exact source state intended for candidate creation.

Conceptually:

```text
Repository:
FamilyOS

Branch:
feature/foundation-engineering-docs

Revision:
<commit>

Working Tree:
clean
```

The exact revision becomes increasingly important as the release approaches candidate qualification.

---

## Build Readiness

Where executable artifacts are involved, build readiness verifies that the release can be built successfully using the applicable Build Framework.

Checks may include:

* build completes successfully;
* build configuration is valid;
* required dependencies resolve;
* expected artifacts are produced;
* build failures are absent;
* reproducibility expectations are satisfied where applicable.

---

## Build Framework Relationship

EPIC-BLD-001 — Build Framework establishes how FamilyOS builds should be produced.

Release Readiness consumes Build Framework evidence.

Conceptually:

```text
Build Framework
      ↓
Build Evidence
      ↓
Release Readiness
```

The Release Framework must not redefine build architecture.

---

## Build Readiness Example

```text
Build Configuration     PASS
Dependency Resolution   PASS
Build Execution         PASS
Expected Outputs        PASS
Build Evidence          AVAILABLE
---------------------------------
BUILD READINESS         PASS
```

---

## Testing Readiness

Testing readiness verifies that required testing has completed successfully before candidate creation.

Applicable testing may include:

* unit tests;
* integration tests;
* functional tests;
* system tests;
* regression tests;
* contract tests;
* compatibility tests.

Testing requirements are defined by the release profile and Testing Framework.

---

## Testing Framework Relationship

EPIC-TST-001 — Testing Framework defines testing architecture.

Release Readiness consumes test results rather than redefining test methodology.

The relationship is:

```text
Testing Framework
      ↓
Test Execution
      ↓
Test Evidence
      ↓
Release Readiness
```

---

## Testing Readiness Example

```text
Unit Tests            PASS
Integration Tests     PASS
Regression Tests      PASS
Required Test Scope   COMPLETE
Known Failures        NONE
--------------------------------
TEST READINESS        PASS
```

---

## Quality Readiness

Quality readiness verifies that applicable Quality Framework gates are satisfied.

Possible checks include:

* static analysis;
* linting;
* type checking;
* quality gates;
* defect status;
* technical debt assessment;
* required quality evidence.

---

## Quality Framework Relationship

EPIC-QLT-001 — Quality Framework defines the authoritative quality model.

Release Readiness should consume quality status.

Example:

```text
Ruff             PASS
MyPy             PASS
Quality Gates    PASS
Blocking Defects NONE
---------------------
QUALITY          PASS
```

---

## Security Readiness

Security readiness evaluates applicable release security requirements.

Checks may include:

* known vulnerability review;
* dependency security state;
* secret exposure checks;
* release credential readiness;
* artifact integrity requirements;
* security approval where required.

Security-sensitive releases may require stronger readiness controls.

---

## Security Blocking Conditions

Examples of potential blockers include:

```text
critical unresolved vulnerability
exposed release credential
untrusted artifact source
missing required security approval
known integrity failure
```

Security risk acceptance must follow governance.

---

## Compliance Readiness

Compliance readiness verifies that applicable FamilyOS compliance requirements are satisfied.

For plugin releases, this may include the Plugin Compliance Framework.

Example:

```text
Plugin Structure       PASS
Metadata               PASS
Required Capabilities  PASS
Compliance Rules       PASS
Blocking Findings      NONE
--------------------------------
PLUGIN COMPLIANCE      PASS
```

---

## Compliance Findings

Not every compliance finding necessarily blocks a release.

Finding severity and applicable policy determine outcome.

Possible results include:

```text
PASS
WARNING
BLOCK
EXCEPTION_REQUIRED
```

Blocking findings must be resolved or formally excepted.

---

## Documentation Readiness

Documentation is part of the release, not an optional post-release activity.

Documentation readiness may verify:

* release documentation exists;
* changelog is prepared;
* release notes are prepared;
* migration guidance exists where required;
* compatibility notes exist where required;
* framework documents are complete;
* references are valid;
* documentation validation passes.

---

## Framework Documentation Readiness

For a FamilyOS framework release, documentation readiness may include:

```text
canonical numbered documents     COMPLETE
control documents                COMPLETE
empty files                      NONE
duplicate numbering              NONE
required headings                PASS
cross-document consistency       PASS
validation document              READY
release document                 READY
implementation checklist         READY
```

---

## Documentation Framework Relationship

EPIC-DOC-001 — Documentation Framework defines documentation architecture and standards.

Release Readiness consumes documentation validation results.

---

## Dependency Readiness

Dependency readiness verifies that required dependencies are known, available, and compatible.

Checks may include:

* dependency versions resolved;
* lock state valid;
* required platform version available;
* required plugin dependencies available;
* external release dependencies satisfied.

---

## Dependency Blocking Example

```text
Target Plugin:
Finance 3.0.0

Requires:
FamilyOS >= 5.0.0

Available Stable Platform:
4.9.0

Result:
BLOCKED
```

The release cannot become stable-ready until the dependency condition is resolved or the release plan changes.

---

## Compatibility Readiness

Compatibility readiness verifies that release compatibility expectations are understood and tested where required.

Areas may include:

* API compatibility;
* CLI compatibility;
* plugin compatibility;
* schema compatibility;
* configuration compatibility;
* data compatibility.

Known compatibility breaks must align with versioning and release documentation.

---

## Configuration Readiness

Configuration readiness verifies that release configuration is complete and valid.

Checks may include:

* release profile;
* build configuration;
* target channel;
* publication targets;
* environment configuration;
* required feature flags;
* version metadata.

Unresolved configuration ambiguity may block candidate creation.

---

## Artifact Readiness

Where artifacts exist before candidate creation, artifact readiness verifies that expected artifact production is understood and successful.

Checks may include:

* artifact set defined;
* expected artifact types produced;
* artifact names valid;
* artifact metadata present;
* checksums available where required.

Final artifact provenance is addressed in `11-Artifacts-and-Provenance.md`.

---

## Version Readiness

Version readiness verifies that the intended release version is valid.

Checks should include:

```text
version syntax
version sequence
version uniqueness
release type compatibility
tag availability where applicable
```

The version may still be candidate-specific at this stage.

---

## Version Readiness Example

```text
Previous Version        4.7.0
Target Version          4.8.0
Expected Increment      MINOR
Syntax                  PASS
Ordering                PASS
Existing Conflict       NONE
--------------------------------
VERSION READINESS       PASS
```

---

## Tag Availability

Before final release tagging, readiness may verify that the intended tag does not already conflict with repository history.

For example:

```text
v4.8.0-release-framework
```

should not already identify another release.

Final tag creation occurs later in the lifecycle.

---

## Risk Readiness

Release risk must be sufficiently understood before candidate creation.

Risk readiness does not require zero risk.

It requires:

* significant risks identified;
* blocking risks resolved;
* mitigations defined;
* accepted risks documented;
* required authority involved.

---

## Risk Outcomes

Possible risk states include:

```text
ACCEPTABLE
MITIGATED
ACCEPTED
BLOCKING
```

A `BLOCKING` risk prevents readiness.

---

## Governance Readiness

Governance readiness verifies that required release responsibilities and authorities are known.

Checks may include:

* release owner identified;
* required reviewers known;
* required approvers known;
* publication authority available;
* exception authority identified.

A release should not enter candidate qualification if no one has authority to complete its later lifecycle.

---

## Recovery Readiness

Recovery readiness verifies that the release has an appropriate response strategy if publication fails or the release proves defective.

Possible strategies include:

```text
rollback
forward fix
withdrawal
channel rollback
corrective release
```

The strategy must reflect the release type and operational environment.

---

## Recovery Readiness Example

```text
Rollback Possible      YES
Previous Stable        4.7.0
Withdrawal Possible    YES
Forward Fix Strategy   DEFINED
Recovery Owner         IDENTIFIED
--------------------------------
RECOVERY READINESS     PASS
```

---

## Publication Readiness

Publication readiness verifies that expected publication targets and mechanisms are understood.

Checks may include:

* publication targets identified;
* credentials available;
* permissions valid;
* target naming valid;
* expected ordering defined;
* verification procedure defined.

Publication execution occurs later.

---

## Publication Readiness Example

```text
Git Branch Push       REQUIRED
Git Tag Push          REQUIRED
Repository Release    NOT REQUIRED
Package Registry      NOT APPLICABLE
Credentials           AVAILABLE
Verification          DEFINED
--------------------------------
PUBLICATION READY     PASS
```

---

## Release Notes Readiness

Release notes should be sufficiently prepared before candidate qualification.

They may still receive final factual updates after validation.

However, core release information should already be known.

This includes:

* release purpose;
* major changes;
* compatibility;
* known limitations;
* migration requirements.

---

## Changelog Readiness

The changelog should reflect the intended release scope.

Checks may include:

```text
release entry exists
changes classified
version consistent
unreleased content reviewed
scope matches candidate intent
```

---

## Known Issue Readiness

Known issues must be classified.

A known issue may be:

```text
blocking
non-blocking
accepted
requires exception
```

The release must not progress while blocking known issues remain unresolved.

---

## Defect Readiness

Open defects should be reviewed against release policy.

For example:

```text
Critical defects    0
High blockers       0
Accepted defects    documented
```

The exact thresholds belong to release and quality policy.

---

## Readiness Evidence

Readiness decisions must be supported by evidence.

Evidence may include:

* command outputs;
* CI results;
* test reports;
* validation reports;
* repository state;
* documentation checks;
* compliance reports;
* approval records;
* risk records.

---

## Evidence Principle

The governing principle is:

> A readiness claim should be reproducible from evidence.

For example:

```text
Testing Ready
```

should be supported by identifiable test execution evidence.

---

## Evidence Freshness

Readiness evidence must correspond to the relevant release state.

Old evidence may become invalid after:

* source changes;
* dependency changes;
* configuration changes;
* build changes;
* candidate changes.

Evidence freshness must be considered before reuse.

---

## Evidence Invalidation

Material release changes may invalidate readiness evidence.

Example:

```text
tests pass
   ↓
source modified
   ↓
previous test evidence may no longer be sufficient
```

The affected readiness domain must be reevaluated.

---

## Readiness Dependency Graph

Readiness domains are not always independent.

For example:

```text
Source
  ↓
Build
  ↓
Artifacts
  ↓
Tests
  ↓
Quality
```

A source change may invalidate several downstream readiness results.

Future automation should model these relationships.

---

## Blocking Conditions

A blocking condition is any unresolved state that prevents progression to `READY`.

Examples include:

* failed required test;
* failed build;
* missing required documentation;
* invalid release version;
* unresolved critical defect;
* compliance blocker;
* unresolved critical security finding;
* incompatible dependency;
* undefined release scope;
* missing required authority.

---

## Blocker Record

A blocker should identify:

```text
blocker
domain
severity
required remediation
owner
status
```

This supports controlled release progression.

---

## Blocker Resolution

A release may transition:

```text
PREPARED
   ↓
BLOCKED
```

After remediation:

```text
BLOCKED
   ↓
readiness reassessment
   ↓
READY
```

The relevant checks must be rerun.

---

## Readiness Exceptions

Some requirements may permit exceptions.

An exception MUST:

* be explicit;
* identify the requirement being waived;
* explain the reason;
* identify the risk;
* identify the authority approving it;
* have an appropriate scope;
* be recorded as release evidence.

---

## Exception Example

```text
Requirement:
optional documentation link check

Status:
unavailable due external service failure

Risk:
low

Exception:
approved

Release:
may proceed
```

Exceptions must not become an informal mechanism for bypassing mandatory release controls.

---

## Non-Exceptionable Requirements

Some requirements may be defined as non-exceptionable.

Examples may include:

* release identity uniqueness;
* critical artifact integrity;
* prohibited credential exposure;
* required security restrictions;
* repository identity ambiguity.

The exact set is governed by release policy.

---

## Readiness Ownership

The Release Owner coordinates readiness.

Individual readiness domains may be owned by specialized authorities.

Example:

```text
Build            Build Framework / Engineering
Testing          Testing Framework
Quality          Quality Framework
Security         Security authority
Compliance       Compliance Framework
Documentation    Documentation Framework
Release          Release Owner
```

---

## Readiness Approval

Readiness confirmation is not necessarily the same as final release approval.

A release may be:

```text
READY
```

without yet being:

```text
APPROVED
```

Readiness authorizes candidate qualification.

Final approval authorizes official release progression.

---

## Manual Readiness Evaluation

At current FamilyOS maturity, some readiness checks may be manual.

A manual readiness evaluation may use commands such as:

```text
git status --short
```

```text
pytest
```

```text
ruff check .
```

```text
mypy src
```

along with framework-specific documentation validation.

Manual execution is acceptable when results remain explicit and reviewable.

---

## Automated Readiness Evaluation

Future FamilyOS tooling should automate deterministic readiness checks.

Potential automated checks include:

* repository cleanliness;
* branch validation;
* version validation;
* tag conflict detection;
* build execution;
* test execution;
* static analysis;
* documentation structure;
* compliance rules;
* artifact existence.

---

## Human Readiness Decisions

Not every readiness condition should be reduced to automation.

Human judgment may remain necessary for:

* risk acceptance;
* release scope quality;
* breaking change assessment;
* migration sufficiency;
* known issue acceptance;
* emergency justification.

Automation should provide evidence.

Governance should provide judgment where judgment is required.

---

## Readiness Report

A release readiness evaluation should eventually produce a structured report.

Example:

```text
FamilyOS Release Readiness

Release              4.8.0
Type                 Framework
Target               Stable

Scope                PASS
Repository           PASS
Documentation        PASS
Version              PASS
Quality              PASS
Risk                 ACCEPTABLE
Governance           PASS
Recovery             PASS
Publication          PASS

Blocking Findings    0
Exceptions           0

RESULT               READY
```

---

## Failed Readiness Report

Example:

```text
FamilyOS Release Readiness

Release              5.0.0
Type                 Platform

Build                PASS
Testing              FAIL
Quality              PASS
Security             PASS
Documentation        PASS

Blocking Findings    2

RESULT               BLOCKED
```

A failed readiness report must not be converted into a release candidate approval.

---

## Readiness Reassessment

Readiness must be reassessed when relevant release state changes.

Triggers may include:

```text
source change
scope change
dependency change
version change
configuration change
security finding
quality regression
documentation change
risk change
```

Not every change requires every readiness check to rerun.

Affected domains must be identified.

---

## Incremental Reassessment

A mature release system should support incremental reassessment.

For example:

```text
Documentation changed

Build            unchanged
Testing          unchanged
Security         unchanged
Documentation    RECHECK
Release Notes    RECHECK
```

This avoids unnecessary work while preserving correctness.

---

## Full Reassessment

Full readiness reassessment may be required after:

* major scope change;
* source baseline replacement;
* dependency graph change;
* release type change;
* target channel change;
* major version change.

---

## Readiness and Candidate Creation

Once the release reaches `READY`, candidate creation may proceed.

The candidate must capture the exact state to be validated.

Conceptually:

```text
READY
  ↓
freeze applicable release state
  ↓
identify source
  ↓
identify artifacts
  ↓
assign candidate identity
  ↓
CANDIDATE
```

---

## Ready Does Not Mean Immutable

A `READY` release may still require controlled changes before candidate creation.

However, material changes may require renewed readiness evaluation.

Candidate creation establishes a stronger identity boundary.

---

## Readiness and Release Freeze

Readiness may establish or strengthen release freeze policies.

For example:

```text
READY
  ↓
scope freeze
  ↓
candidate creation
```

Only release-critical corrections may be accepted after this point according to policy.

---

## Readiness and CI/CD

CI/CD should eventually enforce applicable readiness gates before release workflows can continue.

Conceptually:

```text
prepare
  ↓
readiness jobs
  ↓
all mandatory jobs pass
  ↓
candidate workflow enabled
```

CI/CD is an enforcement mechanism.

The Release Framework remains the policy authority.

---

## Readiness and Local Execution

Local validation may provide useful early evidence.

However, high-assurance releases may require authoritative CI evidence before candidate creation or approval.

The applicable release profile determines required evidence authority.

---

## Readiness and Release Profiles

A framework release may require:

```text
Scope              PASS
Repository         PASS
Documentation      PASS
Version            PASS
Quality            PASS
Governance         PASS
Publication        PASS
```

A plugin release may additionally require:

```text
Build              PASS
Tests              PASS
Plugin Compliance  PASS
Compatibility      PASS
Artifacts          PASS
```

A platform release may require the broadest readiness profile.

---

## Framework Release Readiness

For FamilyOS engineering framework releases, readiness should verify at least:

```text
canonical structure
document completeness
control document completeness
no empty files
no duplicate numbered documents
cross-document consistency
documentation validation
repository cleanliness
version intent
tag availability
release notes / changelog state
publication plan
```

---

## Current EPIC-REL-001 Readiness Model

For EPIC-REL-001 itself, the expected final readiness evaluation should eventually include:

```text
EPIC-REL-001 canonical structure       PASS
00–31 numbered documents               COMPLETE
control documents                      COMPLETE
empty files                            NONE
duplicate numbers                      NONE
framework terminology                  CONSISTENT
cross-references                       VALID
EPIC.yaml                              ALIGNED
MANIFEST.md                            ALIGNED
CHANGELOG.md                           READY
VALIDATION.md                          READY
Revision-History.md                    READY
repository                             CLEAN
version intent                         VALID
tag                                    AVAILABLE
```

The actual final result must be determined from repository evidence at release time.

---

## Readiness Metrics

FamilyOS may eventually track readiness metrics such as:

* number of blockers;
* number of exceptions;
* readiness lead time;
* failed readiness attempts;
* domain failure frequency;
* readiness-to-release duration.

Metrics should improve the release process rather than encourage bypassing controls.

## Readiness Quality

A high-quality readiness process should be:

```text
repeatable
evidence-based
profile-aware
fast enough for regular use
strict on critical controls
automated where deterministic
reviewable where judgment is required
```

---

## Readiness Invariants

The following invariants apply.

### RR1 — A release must satisfy applicable readiness requirements before candidate creation.

### RR2 — Readiness is distinct from final release validation.

### RR3 — Readiness results must be explicit.

### RR4 — Blocking requirements cannot be silently ignored.

### RR5 — Exceptions require explicit governance.

### RR6 — Readiness evidence must correspond to the relevant release state.

### RR7 — Material changes invalidate affected readiness evidence.

### RR8 — Release profiles determine applicable readiness domains.

### RR9 — Readiness does not imply final release approval.

### RR10 — Repository and release identity must be sufficiently defined before candidate creation.

### RR11 — Recovery must be considered before publication.

### RR12 — Readiness must remain auditable.

---

## Readiness Anti-Patterns

### Ready by Assumption

Declaring a release ready because development appears complete.

---

### Test-Only Readiness

Treating passing tests as sufficient evidence for the entire release.

---

### Stale Evidence

Using validation evidence generated before material release changes.

---

### Hidden Blockers

Allowing known blocking defects to remain undocumented.

---

### Exception by Silence

Ignoring a failed requirement without recording an approved exception.

---

### Candidate Before Readiness

Creating formal release candidates before prerequisites are satisfied.

---

### One Checklist for Everything

Applying identical readiness requirements to documentation, plugins, and platform releases regardless of scope.

---

### CI Equals Policy

Assuming that whatever CI happens to execute automatically defines the complete readiness policy.

---

### Local Success Equals Release Readiness

Treating successful local execution as sufficient for every release profile.

---

## Minimum Readiness Requirements

At minimum, every official FamilyOS release should verify:

```text
scope defined
release type defined
version intent valid
repository state understood
required validation identified
required checks passing
blocking issues resolved
documentation sufficiently prepared
risk acceptable
publication path known
recovery considered
```

Only then should the release progress to candidate creation.

---

## Target Readiness Experience

At higher maturity, a maintainer should be able to execute a release readiness evaluation and receive:

```text
FamilyOS Release Readiness

Release             5.2.0
Profile             Platform Stable
Source              VERIFIED
Scope               VERIFIED
Build               PASS
Testing             PASS
Quality             PASS
Security            PASS
Compliance          PASS
Documentation       PASS
Dependencies        PASS
Compatibility       PASS
Version             PASS
Risk                ACCEPTABLE
Recovery            READY
Publication         READY

Blockers            0
Exceptions          0

RESULT              READY

Candidate creation authorized.
```

The report should be reproducible from stored evidence.

## Relationship With Release Planning

`08-Release-Planning.md` determines what the release requires.

This document verifies whether those requirements are satisfied.

```text
Planning
   ↓
Prepared Release
   ↓
Readiness
   ↓
Ready Release
```

---

## Relationship With Release Candidates

`10-Release-Candidates.md` defines the next lifecycle boundary.

Once readiness passes:

```text
READY
   ↓
candidate creation
   ↓
CANDIDATE
```

The candidate then becomes the exact subject of final release validation.

---

## Relationship With Artifacts and Provenance

`11-Artifacts-and-Provenance.md` defines how candidate artifacts are identified and traced to source and build evidence.

Readiness ensures that artifact production can safely enter that stronger qualification model.

---

## Relationship With Release Validation

`12-Release-Validation.md` performs final qualification against the actual release candidate.

Readiness must never be used as a substitute for candidate validation.

---

## Relationship With Release Governance

`21-Release-Governance.md` defines:

* readiness authority;
* exception authority;
* risk acceptance authority;
* release approval authority.

---

## Relationship With Release Risk Management

`24-Release-Risk-Management.md` provides the detailed model for identifying, evaluating, mitigating, accepting, and monitoring release risk.

Readiness consumes the resulting risk state.

---

## Final Statement

The FamilyOS Release Readiness model establishes the formal boundary between release preparation and release candidate qualification.

It ensures that scope, repository state, build status, testing, quality, security, compliance, documentation, dependencies, compatibility, versioning, risk, governance, recovery, and publication prerequisites are evaluated before a release becomes a formal candidate.

By making readiness evidence-based, profile-aware, auditable, and progressively automatable, FamilyOS prevents incomplete release states from entering final qualification and creates a reliable foundation for controlled release candidate creation.
