# Release Framework

## 18 Rollback and Recovery

### Overview

Rollback and recovery are fundamental capabilities of the FamilyOS Release Framework.

Every production release introduces change into a running platform. Even when a release has successfully passed development validation, testing, quality gates, release readiness reviews, and deployment verification, unexpected behavior may still appear after deployment.

A release process must therefore provide a controlled mechanism for restoring the platform to a known safe state when a release causes unacceptable operational, functional, security, compatibility, or data integrity problems.

Rollback and recovery are not emergency improvisations.

They are planned release capabilities.

The FamilyOS Release Framework requires every production release to define how the platform can recover from release-related failures before the release is authorized for production.

The governing principle is:

> Every production release must have a known recovery path before deployment begins.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of rollback and recovery management is to ensure that FamilyOS can respond safely and predictably when a release does not behave as expected.

The framework establishes requirements for:

* rollback planning;
* recovery planning;
* rollback eligibility;
* rollback triggers;
* rollback decision authority;
* release state restoration;
* artifact restoration;
* configuration restoration;
* data recovery;
* compatibility management;
* rollback verification;
* recovery validation;
* incident coordination;
* evidence collection;
* post-recovery assessment.

The objective is not merely to return to a previous software version.

The objective is to restore an acceptable and verified platform state.

---

## Rollback and Recovery Principle

FamilyOS distinguishes between **rollback** and **recovery**.

A rollback restores one or more release components to a previously approved state.

Recovery restores the platform to an acceptable operational state after a release-related failure.

These operations may overlap, but they are not identical.

A rollback may be part of recovery.

Recovery may also require actions beyond rollback, including:

* restoring data;
* repairing configuration;
* disabling features;
* restarting services;
* rebuilding derived state;
* activating compatibility mechanisms;
* deploying a corrective release;
* restoring external integrations.

Therefore:

```text
Release Failure
      |
      v
Impact Assessment
      |
      v
Recovery Decision
      |
      +----------------------+
      |                      |
      v                      v
   Rollback             Forward Recovery
      |                      |
      +----------+-----------+
                 |
                 v
         Recovery Validation
                 |
                 v
         Stable Platform State
```

The selected recovery strategy must minimize risk while restoring acceptable platform behavior.

---

## Recovery Objectives

Rollback and recovery procedures must support the following objectives.

### Safety

Recovery actions must not create greater risk than the release failure they are intended to resolve.

### Predictability

Recovery procedures must be documented, understood, and reproducible.

### Speed

Critical release failures must be recoverable within an operationally acceptable timeframe.

### Integrity

Recovery must preserve or restore system, configuration, and data integrity.

### Traceability

All significant recovery decisions and actions must be recorded.

### Verifiability

The recovered platform state must be validated before the incident is considered resolved.

---

## Recovery Preparedness

Recovery preparation begins before release deployment.

Production deployment must not be treated as the point at which rollback planning begins.

Recovery readiness should be established during release preparation and evaluated as part of release readiness.

At minimum, release preparation must determine:

* which components are changing;
* which artifacts represent the previous stable release;
* whether the release can be rolled back directly;
* whether database or schema changes are reversible;
* whether configuration changes are reversible;
* whether external interfaces remain backward compatible;
* whether data transformations require special recovery procedures;
* whether feature flags can isolate the change;
* whether a corrective forward deployment is safer than rollback;
* how the recovered state will be verified.

A release without an understood recovery strategy carries unmanaged operational risk.

---

## Rollback Eligibility

Not every release can be safely rolled back.

Rollback eligibility must therefore be evaluated explicitly.

A release is considered directly rollback-capable when the previous stable release can be restored without creating unacceptable:

* data corruption;
* schema incompatibility;
* configuration incompatibility;
* API incompatibility;
* dependency conflicts;
* security exposure;
* state inconsistencies.

Rollback eligibility should be determined before production authorization.

The release record should classify rollback capability as one of the following:

```text
DIRECT_ROLLBACK
CONDITIONAL_ROLLBACK
FORWARD_RECOVERY_ONLY
```

### Direct Rollback

The previous stable release can be restored using the established rollback procedure.

### Conditional Rollback

Rollback is possible only after additional recovery actions.

Examples include:

* configuration restoration;
* schema compatibility handling;
* data restoration;
* feature deactivation;
* dependency restoration.

### Forward Recovery Only

Returning to the previous release would create unacceptable risk.

Recovery must instead occur through:

* a corrective release;
* configuration correction;
* feature isolation;
* targeted repair;
* another approved forward-recovery mechanism.

This classification must be visible during release readiness assessment.

---

## Previous Stable Release

Every production release must identify the previous stable release.

The previous stable release acts as the primary software restoration reference when rollback is possible.

The release record should include:

```text
current_release
previous_stable_release
release_artifacts
configuration_baseline
migration_state
rollback_classification
recovery_procedure
```

The previous stable release must correspond to an actual approved release state.

It must not be inferred during an incident.

---

## Artifact Preservation

Rollback depends on the availability of trusted release artifacts.

Artifacts required for recovery must therefore be retained according to the FamilyOS artifact retention policy.

Required recovery artifacts may include:

* application packages;
* container images;
* binaries;
* manifests;
* dependency locks;
* configuration templates;
* deployment descriptors;
* migration definitions;
* checksums;
* signatures;
* provenance information.

Recovery must use previously verified artifacts whenever possible.

Rebuilding an old release during an active incident should not be the default recovery strategy.

The preferred model is:

```text
Build Once
    |
    v
Verify Artifact
    |
    v
Release Artifact
    |
    v
Preserve Artifact
    |
    +------------------+
    |                  |
    v                  v
Deployment          Rollback
```

This preserves artifact identity across release operations.

---

## Rollback Triggers

Rollback or recovery evaluation should begin when a production release causes or is strongly associated with unacceptable degradation.

Potential triggers include:

* release verification failure;
* critical functional regression;
* severe performance degradation;
* service unavailability;
* security regression;
* authorization failure;
* authentication failure;
* data integrity problems;
* incompatible API behavior;
* dependency failures;
* configuration corruption;
* unexpected migration behavior;
* critical observability alerts;
* significant user-impacting defects.

Rollback must not depend solely on subjective judgment during an incident.

Where practical, measurable thresholds should be established before deployment.

---

## Automated Rollback Triggers

Certain deployment environments may support automated rollback.

Examples include automatic recovery when:

* health checks repeatedly fail;
* deployment readiness checks fail;
* startup probes fail;
* error rates exceed approved thresholds;
* critical service dependencies become unavailable;
* deployment verification cannot complete.

Automated rollback must itself be governed.

Automation must not perform destructive recovery operations without appropriate safeguards.

Automated rollback mechanisms should provide:

* clear trigger conditions;
* bounded retry behavior;
* audit logging;
* rollback status reporting;
* failure escalation;
* human override where appropriate.

Automation improves recovery speed but does not eliminate governance requirements.

---

## Rollback Decision Authority

Rollback authority must be defined before production incidents occur.

Depending on release criticality and organizational structure, rollback decisions may involve:

* release owner;
* service owner;
* engineering lead;
* operations owner;
* incident commander;
* security owner;
* platform governance authority.

For severe incidents, the priority is safe restoration rather than administrative delay.

The governance model should therefore allow authorized operational roles to initiate emergency rollback when predefined critical conditions are met.

All emergency rollback decisions must subsequently be recorded and reviewed.

---

## Rollback Decision Model

The rollback decision should consider:

```text
Observed Impact
      |
      v
Release Correlation
      |
      v
Severity Assessment
      |
      v
Rollback Feasibility
      |
      +---------------------------+
      |                           |
      v                           v
Safe Rollback?                  No
      |                           |
     Yes                          v
      |                    Forward Recovery
      v
Execute Rollback
      |
      v
Validate Recovery
```

The decision must consider both the impact of remaining on the current release and the risks introduced by recovery actions.

---

## Rollback Procedure

A rollback procedure must be deterministic and documented.

A typical rollback lifecycle is:

```text
Detect
  |
  v
Assess
  |
  v
Authorize
  |
  v
Stabilize
  |
  v
Rollback
  |
  v
Verify
  |
  v
Observe
  |
  v
Close or Escalate
```

The exact implementation may vary by component or deployment architecture.

However, the control model must remain consistent.

---

## Stabilization Before Rollback

Immediate rollback is not always the safest first action.

The affected environment may first require stabilization.

Possible stabilization actions include:

* stopping additional deployments;
* disabling automated promotion;
* preventing additional migrations;
* isolating affected services;
* disabling problematic features;
* limiting traffic;
* preserving logs and diagnostic evidence;
* preventing destructive operations.

Stabilization creates a controlled environment in which recovery can proceed safely.

---

## Application Rollback

Application rollback restores application components to a previous approved version.

The rollback must use known release artifacts.

The process should verify:

* artifact identity;
* artifact integrity;
* deployment target;
* configuration compatibility;
* dependency compatibility;
* migration compatibility.

After application rollback, the deployment must undergo recovery validation before normal operation is declared restored.

---

## Configuration Rollback

Release failures may result from configuration rather than application code.

Configuration rollback may therefore be sufficient to restore service.

Configuration recovery must identify:

* previous configuration baseline;
* changed configuration values;
* environment-specific overrides;
* secrets or references affected;
* configuration dependencies;
* restart or reload requirements.

Configuration rollback must preserve secret-management and access-control requirements.

Sensitive configuration must never be copied into release evidence in plaintext.

---

## Feature-Level Recovery

FamilyOS should prefer targeted recovery when a failing capability can be isolated safely.

Feature-level recovery may include:

* disabling a feature flag;
* disabling an optional integration;
* reverting a configuration switch;
* routing traffic away from an affected component;
* temporarily disabling a non-critical capability.

Feature isolation can reduce recovery impact compared with complete release rollback.

However, feature-level recovery is valid only when the remaining platform state is consistent and supported.

---

## Database and Schema Recovery

Database changes are among the most significant rollback risks.

Schema changes may make previous application versions incompatible with the current database state.

Database recovery planning must therefore be integrated into release design.

Migration strategies should favor compatibility whenever practical.

Examples include:

* additive schema changes;
* backward-compatible migrations;
* staged migrations;
* expand-and-contract patterns;
* delayed destructive changes;
* reversible migrations where safe.

A production release must not assume that application rollback automatically implies database rollback.

These are separate recovery decisions.

---

## Data Recovery

Data recovery must be treated with greater caution than software rollback.

Incorrect data recovery can cause irreversible loss or corruption.

Data recovery may involve:

* backup restoration;
* point-in-time recovery;
* transaction repair;
* reconciliation;
* replay of trusted events;
* reconstruction of derived state;
* corrective migration.

Data restoration must follow the relevant FamilyOS data governance, security, backup, and operational procedures.

Destructive data recovery operations require explicit authorization.

---

## Migration Recovery

Release migrations must define their recovery characteristics.

Each significant migration should be classified as:

```text
REVERSIBLE
COMPENSATABLE
IRREVERSIBLE
```

### Reversible Migration

The migration can be safely reversed through an approved operation.

### Compensatable Migration

The migration cannot be directly reversed but its effects can be corrected through a compensating operation.

### Irreversible Migration

The migration permanently changes state in a way that cannot safely be undone.

Irreversible migrations require stronger release controls.

They may require:

* backups;
* compatibility periods;
* staged deployment;
* additional approvals;
* expanded verification;
* forward-recovery planning.

---

## Dependency Recovery

A release may change dependencies or dependency expectations.

Recovery must therefore account for:

* runtime dependencies;
* infrastructure dependencies;
* external services;
* package versions;
* plugin dependencies;
* API dependencies;
* storage dependencies.

Rolling back one component while leaving incompatible dependencies at newer versions can create a secondary failure.

Dependency compatibility must be evaluated as part of the rollback procedure.

---

## Plugin Recovery

FamilyOS is a plugin-oriented platform.

Rollback and recovery must therefore consider plugin compatibility independently from core platform recovery.

Plugin recovery may require restoration of:

* plugin package;
* plugin configuration;
* plugin registration;
* capability declarations;
* contribution definitions;
* dependency state;
* plugin-specific migrations.

A plugin rollback must not violate the compatibility requirements of the active FamilyOS platform version.

The release framework must prevent recovery actions that restore a plugin version incompatible with the current platform.

---

## API Compatibility During Recovery

Rollback can reintroduce older API behavior.

This may affect clients or services that have already adapted to the newer release.

Recovery planning must therefore consider:

* API version compatibility;
* contract compatibility;
* schema compatibility;
* client expectations;
* integration behavior.

Backward-compatible release design significantly improves rollback safety.

Breaking API changes require explicit recovery planning.

---

## Security During Recovery

Recovery operations must maintain FamilyOS security requirements.

Emergency conditions do not justify uncontrolled security bypasses.

Recovery procedures must preserve:

* authentication;
* authorization;
* auditability;
* artifact integrity;
* secret protection;
* deployment permissions;
* environment isolation.

Temporary security exceptions, when absolutely necessary, must be:

* explicitly authorized;
* narrowly scoped;
* time limited;
* recorded;
* removed after recovery.

Security controls must return to their approved state before incident closure.

---

## Recovery Verification

Rollback completion does not prove recovery success.

The recovered state must be verified.

Verification should include appropriate checks for:

* service availability;
* application startup;
* health checks;
* critical workflows;
* API behavior;
* data integrity;
* configuration correctness;
* dependency connectivity;
* plugin functionality;
* security controls;
* monitoring signals.

The required verification depth depends on incident severity and release scope.

---

## Recovery Acceptance Criteria

Recovery should be considered successful only when predefined acceptance criteria are satisfied.

Typical criteria include:

```text
Platform operational
Critical services healthy
Critical workflows functional
Data integrity verified
Security controls operational
Error rates within acceptable thresholds
No unresolved critical recovery failures
Monitoring stable
```

The recovered state must be explicitly accepted by the appropriate operational authority.

---

## Post-Rollback Observation

A successful rollback must be followed by an observation period.

The observation period exists to detect:

* delayed failures;
* dependency instability;
* residual data problems;
* recurring errors;
* performance degradation;
* incomplete restoration;
* security anomalies.

The duration of observation should be proportional to release risk and incident severity.

A platform should not be declared stable immediately after the deployment command reports success.

---

## Failed Rollback

Rollback itself can fail.

The framework must therefore define escalation behavior.

Possible failed rollback conditions include:

* previous artifact cannot be deployed;
* configuration is incompatible;
* database state prevents restoration;
* dependency state cannot be restored;
* health checks continue failing;
* data integrity remains uncertain.

When rollback fails:

```text
Rollback Failure
      |
      v
Stop Repeated Unsafe Attempts
      |
      v
Escalate Incident
      |
      v
Activate Recovery Plan
      |
      v
Restore Safe State
```

Repeated uncontrolled rollback attempts must be avoided.

Each failed recovery action can further complicate system state.

---

## Forward Recovery

Forward recovery is the preferred strategy when rollback is unsafe or impossible.

Forward recovery may involve:

* hotfix deployment;
* corrective configuration;
* targeted migration;
* dependency correction;
* feature isolation;
* compatibility patch;
* emergency release.

Forward recovery must still follow controlled release principles.

Urgency may shorten normal release procedures, but it must not eliminate essential validation, authorization, security, or traceability controls.

---

## Emergency Releases

A corrective release produced during recovery is an emergency release.

Emergency releases must remain identifiable.

The release record should capture:

* incident reference;
* affected release;
* corrective change;
* validation performed;
* approvals;
* deployment evidence;
* recovery result.

Emergency release procedures must optimize speed while maintaining minimum mandatory safety controls.

---

## Recovery Evidence

Every significant rollback or recovery operation must generate evidence.

Evidence may include:

* incident identifier;
* affected release version;
* previous stable version;
* detection timestamp;
* trigger condition;
* impact assessment;
* recovery decision;
* decision authority;
* rollback or recovery actions;
* artifact identifiers;
* configuration changes;
* migration actions;
* verification results;
* monitoring results;
* recovery completion time;
* remaining risks.

Evidence supports both operational traceability and continuous improvement.

---

## Recovery Metrics

The Release Framework should measure recovery capability.

Useful metrics include:

* rollback frequency;
* rollback success rate;
* recovery success rate;
* mean time to detect release failure;
* mean time to rollback;
* mean time to recover;
* percentage of releases with validated recovery plans;
* percentage of releases classified as directly rollback-capable;
* failed rollback frequency;
* emergency release frequency.

Metrics should be used to improve release reliability rather than discourage teams from performing necessary rollback actions.

A fast, controlled rollback is preferable to allowing a damaging release to remain active merely to avoid a negative metric.

---

## Recovery Testing

Recovery procedures must be tested.

Untested rollback instructions are assumptions rather than proven capabilities.

Recovery testing may include:

* rollback in non-production environments;
* migration reversal testing;
* backup restoration exercises;
* configuration restoration tests;
* dependency rollback tests;
* disaster recovery exercises;
* simulated release failures;
* emergency release exercises.

High-risk release paths should receive proportionally stronger recovery testing.

---

## Rollback Drills

Periodic rollback drills should be used to validate operational readiness.

A rollback drill can evaluate:

* documentation accuracy;
* artifact availability;
* permissions;
* automation;
* operator familiarity;
* communication procedures;
* verification procedures;
* recovery timing.

Drills should produce findings that feed continuous improvement.

---

## Release Readiness Integration

Rollback and recovery readiness are part of release readiness.

Before production authorization, the release process should confirm:

```text
[ ] Previous stable release identified
[ ] Rollback classification established
[ ] Required artifacts preserved
[ ] Configuration recovery understood
[ ] Migration recovery understood
[ ] Data recovery requirements identified
[ ] Dependency compatibility evaluated
[ ] Rollback authority defined
[ ] Recovery verification defined
[ ] Recovery evidence requirements defined
```

A release with significant unresolved recovery risk should not pass the release readiness gate.

---

## Release Gate Integration

Rollback capability may be enforced through release gates.

Possible gate conditions include:

```text
rollback_plan_present == true
previous_stable_release_known == true
required_artifacts_available == true
migration_recovery_classified == true
recovery_verification_defined == true
critical_recovery_risks_resolved == true
```

Gate automation should verify machine-checkable requirements where practical.

Human review remains necessary for complex recovery risk.

---

## Incident Management Integration

Release rollback and incident management are closely related.

When a release causes significant production impact, recovery actions should operate within the established incident management process.

The incident process provides:

* coordination;
* decision authority;
* communication;
* escalation;
* timeline management;
* evidence preservation.

The Release Framework provides the release-specific recovery model.

Neither replaces the other.

---

## Communication During Recovery

Recovery activities must be communicated clearly to affected stakeholders.

Communication should provide relevant information about:

* incident status;
* affected release;
* observed impact;
* recovery strategy;
* rollback status;
* service restoration;
* remaining risks.

Communication must avoid unverified conclusions.

Technical investigation and stakeholder communication should remain synchronized.

---

## Post-Recovery Review

Significant release recovery events must be reviewed after service stability has been restored.

The review should examine:

* why the release failed;
* why existing validation did not detect the problem;
* whether rollback worked as expected;
* whether recovery documentation was accurate;
* whether artifacts were readily available;
* whether decision authority was clear;
* whether recovery took longer than expected;
* whether additional automation is appropriate.

The purpose is systematic improvement.

The review must feed relevant findings into:

* Release Framework improvements;
* Build Framework improvements;
* Testing Framework improvements;
* Quality Framework improvements;
* deployment practices;
* observability;
* documentation;
* architecture decisions.

---

## Relationship With Build Framework

The Build Framework enables rollback by producing reproducible, immutable, and verifiable artifacts.

The Release Framework relies on those artifacts for controlled restoration.

```text
Build Framework
      |
      v
Trusted Artifact
      |
      v
Release Framework
      |
      +----------------+
      |                |
      v                v
Deployment          Rollback
```

Rollback must preserve the integrity guarantees established during build.

---

## Relationship With Testing Framework

The Testing Framework supports recovery by validating:

* backward compatibility;
* migration behavior;
* rollback procedures;
* critical workflows;
* integration compatibility.

Recovery testing should reuse established testing capabilities wherever practical.

---

## Relationship With Quality Framework

The Quality Framework defines the quality expectations used to determine whether a recovered platform state is acceptable.

Recovery does not lower quality requirements permanently.

Temporary degraded operation may be accepted during incident handling only through explicit risk decisions.

The target remains restoration of the approved quality state.

---

## Relationship With Deployment

Deployment and rollback are complementary release operations.

A mature deployment capability must support both controlled forward change and controlled restoration.

The release lifecycle should therefore treat rollback as part of deployment architecture rather than as an unrelated emergency mechanism.

---

## Governance

Rollback and recovery requirements are governed by the FamilyOS Release Framework.

Governance must ensure that:

* recovery plans exist for production releases;
* rollback feasibility is evaluated;
* recovery authority is defined;
* required artifacts are retained;
* migration risk is understood;
* recovery actions are traceable;
* recovery outcomes are reviewed.

Exceptions require explicit risk acceptance.

---

## Continuous Improvement

Every recovery event provides evidence about the effectiveness of the release system.

The framework should continuously improve based on:

* rollback incidents;
* failed deployments;
* recovery exercises;
* emergency releases;
* recovery timing;
* operator feedback;
* post-incident findings.

Improvement may result in:

* stronger release gates;
* better automation;
* safer migration patterns;
* improved observability;
* longer compatibility windows;
* stronger artifact retention;
* clearer recovery documentation;
* improved release architecture.

Recovery maturity is therefore part of release maturity.

---

## Anti-Patterns

The following practices are prohibited or strongly discouraged.

### No Rollback Plan

Deploying production changes without understanding how service can be restored.

### Rebuilding Previous Releases During Incidents

Depending on a new build of old source code instead of retaining verified artifacts.

### Blind Database Rollback

Reversing application versions without evaluating schema and data compatibility.

### Repeated Uncontrolled Recovery Attempts

Executing recovery actions repeatedly without understanding the resulting system state.

### Undocumented Emergency Changes

Applying production fixes without traceability.

### Assuming Deployment Success Equals Recovery Success

Stopping verification immediately after a rollback command completes.

### Security Bypass as Default Recovery

Disabling security controls simply to accelerate restoration.

### Permanent Emergency State

Leaving temporary recovery configuration or operational exceptions active indefinitely.

---

## Required Outcomes

Implementation of this framework section must ensure that:

* every production release has a defined recovery strategy;
* rollback feasibility is known before deployment;
* previous stable releases remain identifiable;
* recovery artifacts remain available;
* migrations expose recovery characteristics;
* rollback decisions have defined authority;
* recovery actions are controlled and traceable;
* recovered states are verified;
* significant recovery events produce evidence;
* recovery findings drive release process improvement.

---

## Final Rollback and Recovery Principle

FamilyOS must never depend on improvisation when a production release fails.

Release engineering must assume that failures are possible and prepare controlled restoration mechanisms before deployment begins.

The final principle is:

> A release is not operationally ready merely because it can be deployed. It is ready only when FamilyOS also understands how to restore a safe, verified, and trustworthy platform state if that deployment fails.

Rollback and recovery therefore form a permanent part of the FamilyOS release lifecycle, protecting platform availability, integrity, security, and user trust throughout continuous evolution.
