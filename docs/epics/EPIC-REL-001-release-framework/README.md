# Release Framework

## EPIC-REL-001

### Overview

The **FamilyOS Release Framework** defines the official engineering model for preparing, validating, approving, deploying, observing, recovering, measuring, and governing FamilyOS releases.

It establishes release engineering as a permanent platform capability rather than a final operational step performed after development.

The framework connects the FamilyOS engineering foundations with controlled production evolution.

The Release Framework is defined by:

```text
EPIC-REL-001
```

and maintained under:

```text
docs/epics/EPIC-REL-001-release-framework/
```

---

## Purpose

The purpose of the Release Framework is to ensure that FamilyOS releases are:

* intentional;
* identifiable;
* reproducible;
* validated;
* authorized;
* traceable;
* observable;
* recoverable;
* compliant;
* measurable;
* risk-aware.

A release is not considered successful merely because an artifact was deployed.

The framework governs the complete lifecycle from release preparation through runtime acceptance.

---

## Core Principle

The central principle of the Release Framework is:

> Every significant FamilyOS release must be identifiable, validated, authorized, observable, recoverable, measurable, and traceable from source change to runtime outcome.

This principle applies across the complete release lifecycle.

---

## Why the Release Framework Exists

As FamilyOS grows, releases may involve:

* core platform changes;
* official plugins;
* dependencies;
* configuration;
* migrations;
* security changes;
* infrastructure;
* operational changes.

Without a common framework, release practices can fragment.

That fragmentation can create:

* inconsistent versioning;
* unclear release ownership;
* missing release evidence;
* inconsistent approvals;
* artifact ambiguity;
* insufficient rollback preparation;
* weak production verification;
* poor release traceability;
* inconsistent compliance;
* unmanaged release risk.

EPIC-REL-001 establishes one common release foundation.

---

## Framework Scope

The Release Framework covers:

* release principles;
* release architecture;
* release lifecycle;
* release identification;
* versioning;
* release candidates;
* release preparation;
* release readiness;
* release gates;
* release approval;
* artifact promotion;
* deployment;
* post-deployment verification;
* stabilization;
* release acceptance;
* emergency releases;
* hotfixes;
* rollback;
* recovery;
* release evidence;
* traceability;
* observability;
* automation;
* compliance;
* metrics;
* risk management;
* governance;
* roadmap;
* validation;
* framework release.

---

## Release Lifecycle

The canonical release lifecycle is conceptually:

```text
Change
  |
  v
Build
  |
  v
Validation
  |
  v
Release Candidate
  |
  v
Readiness
  |
  v
Approval
  |
  v
Deployment
  |
  v
Verification
  |
  v
Stabilization
  |
  v
Acceptance
```

Failure may transition into:

```text
Blocked
Failed
Rollback
Recovery
```

The release lifecycle therefore includes both successful delivery and controlled failure handling.

---

## Framework Architecture

The Release Framework integrates the existing FamilyOS engineering foundations.

```text
Engineering Foundation
        |
        +-------------------------+
        |                         |
        v                         v
Build Framework           Testing Framework
        |                         |
        +------------+------------+
                     |
                     v
              Quality Framework
                     |
                     v
          Security / Compliance
                     |
                     v
             Release Framework
                     |
                     v
                 Runtime
```

The Release Framework consumes validated engineering evidence.

It does not replace the responsibilities of the underlying frameworks.

---

## Build Once, Promote Many

FamilyOS follows the principle:

> Build once, validate the artifact, and promote the same trusted artifact through release environments.

The preferred model is:

```text
Source
  |
  v
Build
  |
  v
Trusted Artifact
  |
  +------> Testing
  |
  +------> Staging
  |
  +------> Production
```

Rebuilding artifacts between release environments should be avoided where practical.

---

## Release Identity

Every release must have explicit identity.

Release identity may include:

```text
release version
source revision
artifact identity
release candidate identity
release type
target environment
```

Published release identities must remain traceable and stable.

---

## Release Candidates

A release candidate represents a specific state proposed for release.

A candidate must identify the exact:

* source;
* artifacts;
* version;
* dependencies;
* configuration assumptions;
* validation evidence.

Material changes create a new candidate or require renewed validation.

---

## Release Readiness

Release readiness determines whether a candidate is prepared for authorization.

Typical readiness dimensions include:

```text
Build
Testing
Quality
Security
Compliance
Documentation
Rollback
Observability
Risk
Deployment Preparation
```

Readiness must be based on evidence.

---

## Release Gates

Release gates control progression through the release lifecycle.

Typical gates include:

```text
Build Gate
    |
    v
Testing Gate
    |
    v
Quality Gate
    |
    v
Security Gate
    |
    v
Compliance Gate
    |
    v
Release Readiness Gate
```

Mandatory failed gates must prevent unauthorized release progression.

---

## Release Approval

Approval applies to a specific release candidate.

Approval must remain traceable to:

* the release;
* the approved artifact;
* the scope;
* the approver;
* the decision;
* the time of approval.

A materially changed candidate requires renewed consideration.

---

## Deployment

Deployment activates an approved release in a target environment.

Deployment must preserve:

* release identity;
* artifact identity;
* environment identity;
* authorization;
* deployment evidence.

Deployment success alone does not establish release success.

---

## Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment, the runtime state must be verified.

Verification may include:

* health checks;
* critical workflows;
* API behavior;
* plugin health;
* dependency health;
* performance;
* security signals;
* runtime errors.

The objective is to confirm that the deployed release behaves acceptably in its actual environment.

---

## Release Stabilization

Some releases require an observation period before final acceptance.

Stabilization may detect:

* delayed failures;
* accumulated errors;
* scheduled task failures;
* resource exhaustion;
* integration degradation;
* dependency instability.

A release remains under active evaluation until required stabilization criteria are satisfied.

---

## Release Acceptance

Release acceptance marks the transition from deployed candidate to accepted release.

Conceptually:

```text
Deployment
    |
    v
Verification
    |
    v
Stabilization
    |
    v
Acceptance
```

Acceptance must be based on evidence.

---

## Rollback and Recovery

Every significant production release must have an understood recovery strategy.

Possible recovery classifications include:

```text
DIRECT_ROLLBACK
CONDITIONAL_ROLLBACK
FORWARD_RECOVERY_ONLY
```

Recovery planning must consider:

* artifacts;
* configuration;
* migrations;
* persistent data;
* dependencies;
* operational procedures.

Recovery is complete only when the restored platform state has been verified.

---

## Release Observability

Release observability makes production release state visible.

FamilyOS should be able to determine:

```text
What version is running?
Which artifact is active?
When was it deployed?
Is it healthy?
Did behavior change?
Was recovery successful?
```

Release observability may use:

* metrics;
* logs;
* traces;
* health checks;
* deployment events;
* alerts.

---

## Release Evidence

Release decisions must be supported by authoritative evidence.

Evidence may include:

* source revision;
* build result;
* artifact identity;
* test results;
* quality results;
* security results;
* compliance status;
* approval;
* deployment event;
* verification result;
* rollback event;
* recovery result.

Evidence must correspond to the exact release being evaluated.

---

## Release Traceability

The target traceability model is:

```text
Requirement
    |
    v
Source Change
    |
    v
Commit
    |
    v
Build
    |
    v
Artifact
    |
    v
Validation
    |
    v
Release
    |
    v
Deployment
    |
    v
Runtime Evidence
```

This enables reliable investigation and governance.

---

## Release Compliance

Release compliance determines whether applicable release controls have been satisfied.

Possible states include:

```text
COMPLIANT
COMPLIANT_WITH_EXCEPTIONS
NON_COMPLIANT
PENDING
```

Missing required evidence must never silently become compliance success.

---

## Release Risk Management

Every significant release should receive a risk classification.

The standard model is:

```text
LOW
MEDIUM
HIGH
CRITICAL
```

Risk considers:

* likelihood;
* impact;
* blast radius;
* data impact;
* migration complexity;
* security;
* compatibility;
* recovery;
* observability;
* operational complexity.

Control depth should increase with release risk.

---

## Release Metrics

The Release Framework defines metrics for understanding release system health.

Examples include:

* release frequency;
* release lead time;
* release success rate;
* deployment success rate;
* change failure rate;
* rollback rate;
* rollback success rate;
* mean time to detect;
* mean time to recover;
* compliance exception rate;
* gate failure rates.

Metrics exist to improve the release system, not to create simplistic individual performance scores.

---

## Release Automation

Release automation should progressively implement the framework.

The target evolution is:

```text
Documented Process
      |
      v
Structured Metadata
      |
      v
Automated Validation
      |
      v
Automated Gates
      |
      v
Automated Verification
      |
      v
Risk-Aware Delivery
```

Automation must remain observable, governable, and safe.

---

## Progressive Delivery

Future FamilyOS release capabilities may support:

* canary deployment;
* phased rollout;
* rolling deployment;
* blue-green deployment;
* feature-controlled activation.

Progressive delivery reduces blast radius by increasing exposure only when evidence remains acceptable.

---

## Emergency Releases

Emergency releases are accelerated releases.

They are not uncontrolled releases.

Minimum controls must preserve:

* release identity;
* traceability;
* critical validation;
* authorization;
* recovery;
* deployment evidence;
* runtime verification.

Deferred controls must remain explicit and governed.

---

## Plugin Releases

Plugin releases are governed by both plugin compliance and release governance.

```text
Plugin
  |
  v
Plugin Compliance
  |
  v
Release Eligibility
  |
  v
Release Framework
  |
  v
Authorized Release
```

Plugin compliance does not independently authorize production release.

---

## Framework Relationships

The Release Framework integrates with several FamilyOS engineering foundations.

### Engineering Foundation

Provides the broader engineering governance model.

### Documentation Framework

Defines documentation structure, standards, lifecycle, and governance.

### Testing Framework

Provides test architecture and release-relevant testing evidence.

### Quality Framework

Provides quality principles, quality gates, and quality evidence.

### Build Framework

Provides reproducible builds, trusted artifacts, provenance, and integrity.

### Plugin Compliance Framework

Provides plugin compliance evidence used during release eligibility assessment.

These frameworks remain independently governed while contributing to release decisions.

```

---

## Canonical Inventory

`MANIFEST.md` defines the authoritative framework inventory.

Repository state should be considered structurally valid only when it matches that manifest.

This includes:

* numbered documents;
* supporting artifacts;
* naming;
* numbering;
* expected metadata.

---

## Validation

Framework validation is defined by:

```text
28-Validation.md
```

Current validation evidence and status are recorded in:

```text
VALIDATION.md
```

Validation covers:

* structural completeness;
* content completeness;
* cross-document consistency;
* framework integration;
* operational applicability.

---

## Structural Verification

A basic structural review may use:

```bash
EPIC_DIR="docs/epics/EPIC-REL-001-release-framework"

printf '\n=== RELEASE FRAMEWORK STRUCTURE ===\n'
tree "$EPIC_DIR"

printf '\n=== FILE SIZES ===\n'
find "$EPIC_DIR" -maxdepth 1 -type f \
  -exec wc -c {} \; | sort -k2

printf '\n=== EMPTY FILES ===\n'
find "$EPIC_DIR" -maxdepth 1 -type f -empty -print | sort

printf '\n=== NUMBERED DOCUMENTS ===\n'
find "$EPIC_DIR" -maxdepth 1 -type f \
  -name '[0-9][0-9]-*.md' \
  -exec basename {} \; | sort
```

The expected result is:

* complete canonical inventory;
* no required empty files;
* no duplicate numbered documents;
* no unexpected structural defects.

---

## Governance

The Release Framework belongs to the FamilyOS Engineering Platform.

Governance is responsible for:

* maintaining normative consistency;
* managing framework evolution;
* reviewing material changes;
* maintaining the canonical inventory;
* preserving relationships with adjacent frameworks;
* ensuring revalidation after significant changes.

Material architectural changes may require an ADR.

---

## Versioning

The Release Framework is versioned as an engineering foundation.

Released framework versions must remain traceable through Git history and release tags.

Normative changes should be reflected in:

* EPIC metadata;
* CHANGELOG.md;
* Revision-History.md;
* validation evidence;
* release identity.

Published framework versions should not be silently rewritten.

---

## Roadmap

The framework roadmap is defined in:

```text
26-Roadmap.md
```

The long-term evolution is:

```text
Defined
  |
  v
Standardized
  |
  v
Automated
  |
  v
Observable
  |
  v
Risk-Aware
  |
  v
Progressive
  |
  v
Adaptive
```

Framework completion does not require all advanced roadmap capabilities to already be implemented.

---

## Framework Completion

EPIC-REL-001 is considered complete when:

```text
[ ] Canonical document inventory is complete
[ ] Required files are substantive
[ ] No duplicate numbered documents exist
[ ] Release lifecycle is defined
[ ] Release readiness is defined
[ ] Release gates are defined
[ ] Release approval is defined
[ ] Artifact promotion is defined
[ ] Deployment governance is defined
[ ] Rollback and recovery are defined
[ ] Observability is defined
[ ] Compliance is defined
[ ] Metrics are defined
[ ] Risk management is defined
[ ] Governance is defined
[ ] Roadmap is defined
[ ] Validation succeeds
[ ] Metadata is synchronized
[ ] Framework release is completed
```

---

## Framework Baseline

Once released, EPIC-REL-001 becomes the normative baseline for FamilyOS release engineering.

Future release tooling and automation should implement this framework rather than establish independent release rules.

Potential future capabilities include:

* FamilyOS release CLI;
* automated release manifests;
* release readiness validation;
* policy-as-code;
* automated release gates;
* artifact promotion;
* progressive delivery;
* automated rollback;
* release analytics;
* release intelligence.

---

## Final Principle

The Release Framework exists to ensure that production change remains controlled as FamilyOS grows.

Its purpose is not to make releases bureaucratic.

Its purpose is to make release state explicit, release decisions evidence-based, failure recoverable, and platform evolution trustworthy.

The final principle is:

> FamilyOS must treat every significant release as a governed engineering lifecycle that begins before deployment and ends only when the resulting runtime state has been verified, accepted, and made traceable.

EPIC-REL-001 provides the official engineering foundation for that lifecycle.
