# Release Framework

## 25 Framework Lifecycle

### Overview

EPIC-REL-001 — Release Framework defines not only how FamilyOS releases software and engineering assets, but also how the Release Framework itself must evolve over time.

A release framework that governs every other release process must not evolve through informal or uncontrolled changes.

Its own lifecycle must therefore be:

* explicit;
* versioned;
* governed;
* validated;
* traceable;
* backward-aware;
* reviewable;
* replaceable when necessary.

The Framework Lifecycle establishes how EPIC-REL-001 progresses from initial definition through adoption, maintenance, revision, deprecation, and eventual replacement.

The central principle is:

> The Release Framework must be governed by the same release discipline it establishes for the rest of FamilyOS.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to define:

* framework lifecycle states;
* framework maturity;
* framework ownership;
* normative change control;
* framework validation;
* framework versioning;
* framework release;
* compatibility management;
* framework amendments;
* major revisions;
* deprecation;
* replacement;
* migration;
* archival;
* historical preservation.

The objective is to ensure that release rules remain stable enough to govern engineering while still being able to evolve as FamilyOS matures.

---

## Framework Lifecycle Principle

The Release Framework is a versioned engineering capability.

It must not be treated as static documentation.

Changes to release rules can affect:

* CI/CD workflows;
* release automation;
* repository policy;
* versioning;
* publication;
* security controls;
* plugin releases;
* governance;
* compliance;
* release evidence.

Therefore, changes to EPIC-REL-001 may have platform-wide consequences.

---

## Canonical Framework Lifecycle

The conceptual lifecycle is:

```text
PROPOSED
   ↓
DRAFT
   ↓
VALIDATED
   ↓
APPROVED
   ↓
RELEASED
   ↓
ACTIVE
   ↓
MAINTAINED
   ↓
DEPRECATED
   ↓
RETIRED
```

Additional states may include:

```text
SUPERSEDED
ARCHIVED
```

Not every implementation must expose these states formally.

The lifecycle semantics should remain explicit.

---

## PROPOSED

### Definition

`PROPOSED` represents an identified need for a new Release Framework or a significant change to the existing framework.

A proposal may originate from:

* release failures;
* platform growth;
* security requirements;
* governance changes;
* tooling evolution;
* compliance findings;
* new distribution models;
* ecosystem expansion.

At this stage, no normative framework change exists yet.

---

## Proposal Inputs

A framework proposal should identify:

* problem;
* motivation;
* impacted release domains;
* expected benefits;
* compatibility concerns;
* implementation impact.

Significant proposals may require an ADR or RFC.

---

## DRAFT

### Definition

`DRAFT` represents a framework revision under active design.

Draft rules may be reviewed and tested.

They MUST NOT silently replace active normative rules before approval.

A draft may include changes to:

* lifecycle states;
* versioning rules;
* release profiles;
* validation gates;
* security requirements;
* governance authority;
* evidence requirements.

---

## Draft Isolation

Experimental framework ideas should remain distinguishable from active requirements.

The following must be avoided:

```text
active release process
+
unapproved draft requirement
=
ambiguous policy
```

Draft state must remain visible.

---

## VALIDATED

### Definition

`VALIDATED` means that the proposed framework revision has passed applicable framework validation.

Validation may include:

* structural validation;
* document completeness;
* normative consistency;
* cross-reference validation;
* compatibility review;
* architecture review;
* governance review;
* implementation impact review.

Validation does not yet make the framework active.

---

## APPROVED

### Definition

`APPROVED` means that the framework revision has received required governance approval.

Approval should apply to:

* exact framework revision;
* intended version;
* normative change set;
* migration requirements;
* effective scope.

---

## RELEASED

### Definition

`RELEASED` means that the approved framework revision has received an official version and release identity.

For current FamilyOS repository practice, this may include:

```text
release commit
+
annotated Git tag
+
remote publication
```

The released framework becomes an official historical engineering state.

---

## ACTIVE

### Definition

`ACTIVE` means that the framework version is the authoritative Release Framework governing applicable FamilyOS releases.

Only one primary framework version should normally be authoritative for a given governance scope unless transition policy explicitly supports multiple active versions.

---

## MAINTAINED

### Definition

`MAINTAINED` describes an active framework receiving compatible corrections and improvements.

Typical maintenance changes include:

* clarifications;
* corrected references;
* improved examples;
* non-breaking terminology refinement;
* improved automation guidance;
* additional compatible release profiles.

Maintenance must preserve normative stability unless a versioned behavioral change is intentionally introduced.

---

## DEPRECATED

### Definition

`DEPRECATED` means that a framework version remains historically valid but should no longer be used for new release implementation.

A deprecated framework may still govern historical releases.

Deprecation should identify:

* successor;
* effective date;
* migration requirements;
* support period.

---

## RETIRED

### Definition

`RETIRED` means the framework version is no longer supported for active release engineering.

Retirement must not erase its historical role.

---

## SUPERSEDED

A framework is `SUPERSEDED` when a newer framework version becomes authoritative.

For example:

```text
Release Framework 1.x
      ↓
Release Framework 2.0
      ↓
1.x SUPERSEDED
```

The previous framework remains available for historical interpretation.

---

## ARCHIVED

Archived framework material remains preserved but is no longer part of active governance.

Archive state is appropriate for obsolete implementation guidance, retired policies, or historical framework versions.

---

## Framework Version Identity

The Release Framework must have an explicit release identity.

For current FamilyOS milestone releases, a tag may use:

```text
v4.8.0-release-framework
```

where:

```text
4.8.0
```

is the release version and:

```text
release-framework
```

identifies the framework milestone.

Future framework versions must preserve clear identity.

---

## Framework Versioning Principle

Framework versioning should reflect the significance of normative changes.

Conceptually:

```text
PATCH
clarification / correction

MINOR
compatible framework capability expansion

MAJOR
material change to release semantics or governance
```

The exact repository-wide version strategy remains governed by `06-Versioning-Strategy.md`.

---

## Non-Normative Correction

A non-normative correction does not intentionally change release behavior.

Examples include:

* spelling;
* formatting;
* broken links;
* clearer explanation;
* corrected example.

Such changes may require only lightweight framework maintenance.

---

## Normative Change

A normative change modifies release obligations.

Examples include:

* new mandatory gate;
* changed versioning rule;
* changed approval requirement;
* new non-exceptionable control;
* changed release state semantics;
* altered publication requirement.

Normative changes require stronger governance.

---

## Breaking Framework Change

A framework change is breaking when existing compliant release implementations may become non-compliant or change meaning.

Examples include:

```text
stable tags now require signatures
```

or:

```text
release candidate stage becomes mandatory
```

or:

```text
existing version semantics are redefined
```

Such changes require explicit migration planning.

---

## Framework Change Classification

Every significant framework revision SHOULD be classified.

Possible categories include:

```text
EDITORIAL
CLARIFICATION
COMPATIBLE
NORMATIVE
BREAKING
SECURITY
```

Classification helps determine validation, approval, versioning, and migration requirements.

---

## Change Proposal

A framework change proposal should identify:

```text
current rule
proposed rule
reason
affected documents
affected implementations
compatibility impact
migration impact
```

This prevents isolated edits from unintentionally changing framework semantics.

---

## Change Sources

Framework changes may originate from:

* implementation experience;
* release incidents;
* compliance findings;
* security reviews;
* platform architecture changes;
* plugin ecosystem evolution;
* user or maintainer feedback;
* automation maturity.

Operational evidence should inform framework evolution.

---

## Architecture Decision Requirement

Significant architectural changes SHOULD use an ADR where appropriate.

Examples include:

* adopting mandatory signed artifacts;
* introducing release orchestration;
* adopting a new platform release model;
* changing component version independence;
* introducing multi-repository releases.

The ADR establishes the architectural decision.

The Release Framework then incorporates it.

---

## RFC Requirement

Broad or ecosystem-impacting framework changes MAY require an RFC.

An RFC can provide:

* motivation;
* alternatives;
* migration;
* compatibility analysis;
* implementation plan.

Framework documentation should not replace deeper design discussion when substantial ecosystem change is involved.

---

## Framework Ownership

EPIC-REL-001 must have explicit ownership.

Framework owners are responsible for:

* maintaining normative coherence;
* reviewing changes;
* ensuring validation;
* coordinating releases;
* resolving inconsistencies;
* maintaining lifecycle status.

Ownership must not depend solely on repository write access.

---

## Framework Maintainer

A Framework Maintainer may perform operational maintenance such as:

* documentation corrections;
* cross-reference updates;
* changelog updates;
* validation runs.

Normative authority may require additional approval.

---

## Framework Authority

Framework Authority controls changes to normative Release Framework behavior.

This authority may approve:

* new mandatory rules;
* governance changes;
* lifecycle changes;
* major framework revisions;
* framework retirement.

---

## Framework Validation

Every official framework revision must be validated before release.

Validation should include applicable checks such as:

```text
canonical structure
document completeness
control document alignment
numbering
references
terminology
normative consistency
cross-document consistency
version consistency
```

---

## Semantic Validation

Structural validation alone is insufficient.

Framework validation must also assess semantic coherence.

Questions include:

```text
Do lifecycle rules contradict publishing rules?

Do governance requirements match approval transitions?

Do versioning rules match tagging rules?

Do security rules conflict with exception policy?

Do release profiles preserve common invariants?
```

---

## Cross-Document Validation

EPIC-REL-001 contains interdependent documents.

A change to one document may require updates elsewhere.

For example:

```text
05-Release-Lifecycle.md
```

changes may affect:

```text
04-Release-Architecture.md
09-Release-Readiness.md
12-Release-Validation.md
13-Release-Automation.md
21-Release-Governance.md
22-Release-Compliance.md
```

Cross-document validation is therefore mandatory for normative changes.

---

## Control Document Validation

Framework control documents must remain aligned.

These may include:

```text
EPIC.yaml
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
README.md
```

A framework revision should not be considered complete if control metadata contradicts normative documents.

---

## Framework Readiness

Before release, framework readiness should confirm:

```text
scope complete
required documents complete
validation complete
open blockers resolved
version intent valid
changelog prepared
release document prepared
implementation checklist aligned
repository state ready
```

---

## Framework Candidate

A major framework revision MAY use a formal release candidate.

Example:

```text
Release Framework 2.0.0-rc.1
```

This becomes useful when the framework itself has significant implementation impact.

Current documentation milestones may initially use a simpler final-validation workflow.

---

## Framework Approval

Framework approval should consider:

* normative completeness;
* architecture consistency;
* compatibility;
* migration burden;
* security;
* implementation feasibility.

Approval must bind to the exact framework revision.

---

## Framework Release

A framework release should follow the same high-level principles applied elsewhere.

Conceptually:

```text
complete revision
      ↓
validate
      ↓
approve
      ↓
final commit
      ↓
version
      ↓
annotated tag
      ↓
publish
      ↓
verify
```

---

## Self-Application Principle

The Release Framework should progressively become capable of using its own rules for its own releases.

This creates a bootstrap relationship:

```text
Release Framework v1
      ↓
governs release of
Release Framework v2
```

The framework must support this without logical circularity.

---

## Bootstrap Model

The initial version of EPIC-REL-001 may be released using the established FamilyOS engineering release practice that preceded it.

After publication, future revisions should progressively use the formalized Release Framework.

This is an acceptable bootstrap strategy.

---

## Effective Date

A framework revision SHOULD define when its normative rules become effective.

Possible models include:

```text
effective immediately upon release
```

or:

```text
effective for releases initiated after a given date
```

or:

```text
effective after implementation milestone X
```

The effective model must be explicit for breaking changes.

---

## Framework Adoption

Releasing the framework does not necessarily mean every automation capability is immediately implemented.

Adoption may progress through:

```text
documentation
      ↓
manual conformance
      ↓
automation
      ↓
policy enforcement
```

The framework may define a target state ahead of full tooling maturity.

---

## Implementation Status

Framework capability and implementation capability must remain distinct.

For example:

```text
Framework Requirement:
artifact provenance required for platform releases

Implementation Status:
manual provenance initially
automated provenance planned
```

An implementation gap should remain visible.

---

## Conformance Levels

Future FamilyOS governance MAY introduce framework conformance levels.

For example:

```text
Baseline
Standard
Advanced
```

These could represent increasing implementation maturity.

Core mandatory rules must remain clear.

---

## Migration Planning

Breaking framework revisions must include a migration strategy.

Migration may affect:

* CI/CD;
* release scripts;
* release profiles;
* version metadata;
* tags;
* governance roles;
* compliance rules.

---

## Migration Window

A major framework change may define a transition period.

Conceptually:

```text
Framework v1 ACTIVE
Framework v2 RELEASED

transition window

Framework v2 ACTIVE
Framework v1 DEPRECATED
```

This prevents immediate disruption.

---

## Dual Framework Operation

Temporary coexistence of framework versions MAY be permitted during migration.

If so, governance must define:

* which releases use which version;
* how compliance is evaluated;
* transition deadline.

Indefinite ambiguity is not acceptable.

---

## Compatibility

Framework evolution must consider backward compatibility with existing release implementations.

Compatibility questions include:

```text
Will existing pipelines remain valid?

Will existing tags retain meaning?

Will old release evidence remain interpretable?

Will current plugins still satisfy release requirements?
```

Historical meaning must always be preserved.

---

## Historical Compatibility

New framework versions MUST NOT retroactively redefine what historical releases meant.

For example, if old releases were valid under an earlier policy, a new policy should not silently rewrite their historical status.

---

## Grandfathering

Some existing release states may be grandfathered under previous framework rules.

Grandfathering must be explicit.

It should not become a permanent bypass for new releases.

---

## Deprecation Policy

When framework behavior is planned for removal, deprecation should be explicit.

A deprecation should identify:

```text
deprecated rule or mechanism
replacement
reason
migration
removal target
```

where known.

---

## Deprecated Automation

For example, a manual tag-only release process might eventually become deprecated in favor of structured release evidence.

The old method may remain temporarily supported while migration occurs.

---

## Framework Retirement

A framework version may be retired when:

* all supported release workflows have migrated;
* a successor is active;
* historical documentation is preserved.

Retirement should not delete prior normative history.

---

## Framework Archival

Retired framework versions should be archived in a durable way.

Archive should preserve:

* documents;
* version;
* tags;
* changelog;
* release history;
* migration information.

This allows historical releases to be interpreted under the rules that governed them.

---

## Framework Replacement

A future release architecture may become sufficiently different that EPIC-REL-001 is replaced rather than incrementally revised.

Replacement should define:

* successor;
* compatibility;
* migration;
* transition period;
* archival plan.

The successor must not erase EPIC-REL-001 history.

---

## Framework Forking

FamilyOS SHOULD avoid multiple incompatible Release Framework forks.

If specialized release needs emerge, they should normally use:

* profiles;
* extensions;
* domain-specific policies.

Creating independent competing release frameworks should require strong architectural justification.

---

## Extension Model

The preferred model is:

```text
Core Release Framework
        ↓
Release Profiles
        ↓
Domain Extensions
```

Examples include:

```text
plugin release profile
security release profile
documentation release profile
```

This preserves shared semantics.

---

## Framework Profile Evolution

Release profiles may evolve more frequently than core principles.

A profile change may introduce:

* additional validation;
* new publication target;
* new evidence requirement.

Such changes must remain compatible with core framework semantics.

---

## Framework Principles Stability

Core principles should have the highest stability.

Examples include:

```text
release identity is explicit
validation applies to actual candidate
published versions remain immutable
governance authority is explicit
```

Frequent changes to these principles would indicate architectural instability.

---

## Architecture Stability

Release architecture may evolve, but architectural boundaries should remain relatively stable.

Implementation details can change more frequently.

The hierarchy is:

```text
Principles
most stable

Architecture
stable

Policies / Profiles
moderately stable

Automation
more changeable

Tool implementation
most changeable
```

---

## Framework Technical Debt

The Release Framework may accumulate documentation or architectural debt.

Examples include:

* duplicate rules;
* outdated examples;
* inconsistent terminology;
* obsolete tool references;
* missing automation mapping.

Framework debt should be tracked and resolved like engineering debt.

---

## Framework Quality

Framework quality should be evaluated for:

* clarity;
* consistency;
* completeness;
* testability;
* enforceability;
* maintainability;
* scalability.

A framework that cannot be implemented reliably requires revision.

---

## Framework Observability

The effectiveness of the Release Framework should be observable through release outcomes.

Useful signals include:

* recurring release failures;
* frequent exceptions;
* unclear ownership;
* repeated version mistakes;
* publication recovery incidents;
* governance delays.

These signals should feed framework improvement.

---

## Framework Metrics

Potential lifecycle metrics include:

```text
framework change frequency
normative change count
exception-driven framework changes
release incident count
implementation coverage
profile adoption
automation coverage
```

Metrics should support evolution rather than encourage change for its own sake.

---

## Framework Feedback Loop

The desired improvement loop is:

```text
Release Execution
      ↓
Evidence
      ↓
Metrics / Incidents
      ↓
Framework Assessment
      ↓
Framework Improvement
      ↓
Updated Release Practice
```

This turns release operations into learning input.

---

## Incident-Driven Change

A severe release incident may reveal framework weaknesses.

The response should distinguish:

```text
implementation failure
```

from:

```text
framework design failure
```

A script bug should not automatically cause policy change.

A missing architectural control may justify framework revision.

---

## Compliance Feedback

Release Compliance findings may expose recurring ambiguity or impractical requirements.

Repeated exceptions may indicate that:

* policy needs clarification;
* implementation is incomplete;
* the framework is unrealistic.

The cause should be analyzed before changing rules.

---

## Security Feedback

Release security incidents may require immediate framework enhancement.

Examples include:

* stronger credential policy;
* signed artifacts;
* tag protection;
* improved provenance.

Security changes may require accelerated framework release.

---

## Emergency Framework Update

An urgent framework correction MAY use an accelerated governance path if current rules create immediate release risk.

Even then, the change must remain:

* versioned;
* validated appropriately;
* approved;
* documented.

---

## Framework Rollback

A framework revision may itself prove defective.

Rollback semantics differ from software rollback.

The preferred response may be:

```text
new framework version released
      ↓
critical governance flaw discovered
      ↓
suspend new policy
      ↓
restore previous active policy temporarily
      ↓
release corrected framework revision
```

Historical framework versions must remain identifiable.

---

## Framework Forward Recovery

Forward recovery may be preferable to rewriting a released framework version.

For example:

```text
2.0.0 defective
      ↓
2.0.1 corrected
```

rather than silently replacing `2.0.0`.

---

## Framework Immutability

A released framework version should be treated as an immutable historical normative state.

Editorial corrections may be recorded transparently.

Material normative changes require a new framework release identity.

---

## Framework Evidence

A released framework should preserve evidence including:

```text
framework version
source commit
release tag
validation result
approval
changelog
release record
```

This allows historical interpretation.

---

## Revision History

`Revision-History.md` should record meaningful framework evolution.

It should identify:

* version;
* date;
* significant changes;
* normative impact;
* lifecycle state.

---

## Changelog Relationship

`CHANGELOG.md` should record release-oriented framework changes.

Revision History may provide additional documentation-oriented evolution context.

These documents must remain consistent.

---

## EPIC Metadata

`EPIC.yaml` should reflect the framework's current official state.

Potential metadata includes:

```text
status
version
deliverables
dependencies
decisions
```

The exact schema is governed elsewhere.

---

## Manifest Relationship

`MANIFEST.md` should define authoritative documents and framework completeness expectations.

Framework lifecycle changes affecting document structure must update the manifest.

---

## Validation Record

`VALIDATION.md` should provide evidence that the framework release satisfies its own completion criteria.

Validation state must correspond to the actual release candidate.

---

## Release Document

`30-Release.md` should document the specific completion and publication state of the framework milestone.

It must not replace the general rules defined in this lifecycle document.

---

## Implementation Checklist

`31-Implementation-Checklist.md` should distinguish:

* framework documentation complete;
* required immediate implementation complete;
* planned future automation.

A framework can be released while some long-term implementation remains roadmap work if that status is explicit.

---

## Framework Lifecycle Roles

The lifecycle may involve:

```text
Framework Owner
Framework Maintainer
Framework Validator
Framework Approver
Release Authority
```

Small-team operation may combine roles.

Authority semantics must remain explicit.

---

## Framework Lifecycle Governance

Major lifecycle transitions should be governed.

Conceptually:

```text
DRAFT → VALIDATED
Framework Validator

VALIDATED → APPROVED
Framework Authority

APPROVED → RELEASED
Release Authority

ACTIVE → DEPRECATED
Framework Authority

DEPRECATED → RETIRED
Platform Governance
```

The exact authority mapping may evolve.

---

## Framework Lifecycle Automation

Future tooling may automate:

* structural checks;
* duplicate detection;
* cross-reference validation;
* metadata consistency;
* version validation;
* tag preparation.

Human review remains necessary for normative meaning.

---

## Framework Lifecycle CI/CD

CI/CD may eventually run framework-specific pipelines.

Example:

```text
validate markdown
      ↓
validate structure
      ↓
validate metadata
      ↓
validate cross-references
      ↓
framework readiness report
```

Publication should remain governed.

---

## Framework Compatibility Assessment

Every significant revision should answer:

```text
Does this change existing release behavior?

Does it invalidate current automation?

Does it change mandatory evidence?

Does it affect version semantics?

Does it affect governance authority?

Does migration documentation need updating?
```

---

## Framework Impact Analysis

Impact should be assessed across:

```text
core
CLI
plugins
CI/CD
documentation
security
compliance
release automation
```

Large blast radius changes require stronger governance.

---

## Framework Change Risk

Framework changes can themselves introduce release risk.

Risks include:

* contradictory rules;
* unimplementable requirements;
* automation breakage;
* excessive manual burden;
* ambiguous authority.

Framework release planning must assess these risks.

---

## Framework Adoption Verification

After a new framework version becomes active, FamilyOS should verify that applicable release workflows actually conform.

This may involve:

* pipeline review;
* documentation review;
* release simulation;
* compliance checks.

A framework is ineffective if implementation never adopts it.

---

## Framework Drift

Framework Drift occurs when actual release practice diverges from active normative rules.

Examples include:

```text
framework requires approval
pipeline auto-publishes without approval
```

or:

```text
framework requires provenance
release tooling records none
```

Drift must be treated as an implementation or governance gap.

---

## Drift Detection

Release Compliance should eventually detect framework drift automatically where possible.

Recurring drift may trigger implementation work or framework reassessment.

---

## Implementation Lag

Some framework capabilities may intentionally precede implementation.

Such lag should be visible.

For example:

```text
Framework:
signed provenance supported

Implementation:
planned, not mandatory yet
```

The framework must distinguish target architecture from currently enforceable requirements.

---

## Mandatory vs Future Capability

Normative documents should clearly distinguish:

```text
MUST
SHOULD
MAY
future target
```

This prevents roadmap ideas from being interpreted as immediate blockers.

---

## Framework Documentation Stability

Document filenames and canonical structure should remain stable once published where practical.

Unnecessary renaming creates:

* broken references;
* migration burden;
* historical ambiguity.

Structural change should require explicit framework migration.

---

## Document Deprecation

If a framework document is replaced, the lifecycle should define whether it is:

* renamed;
* superseded;
* archived;
* merged.

Historical references should remain understandable.

---

## Numbering Stability

Numbered framework documents should not be casually renumbered after release.

If numbering must change, the migration should preserve mapping from previous identifiers.

---

## Canonical Structure Evolution

Structural evolution may be justified when:

* new domains emerge;
* documents become too large;
* responsibilities need clearer separation.

Such changes should be deliberate rather than accidental.

---

## Framework Reference Stability

Cross-framework references should use stable identifiers where possible.

References to:

* EPIC identifiers;
* ADR identifiers;
* RFC identifiers;
* specification identifiers;

are generally more durable than informal names alone.

---

## Dependency Lifecycle

EPIC-REL-001 depends conceptually on other FamilyOS foundations.

Changes in those frameworks may require Release Framework review.

Examples include:

* Build Framework;
* Testing Framework;
* Quality Framework;
* Documentation Framework;
* Plugin Compliance Framework.

---

## Upstream Change Review

When an upstream framework changes materially, Release Framework maintainers should determine whether:

```text
release readiness changes
validation changes
evidence changes
governance changes
```

are required.

---

## Downstream Impact

Release Framework changes may affect every release-producing subsystem.

Downstream impact must therefore be assessed before major normative changes.

---

## Framework Release Cadence

The Release Framework should evolve when needed.

It should not adopt arbitrary frequent release cadence solely for activity.

Framework stability is valuable.

Changes should be driven by real engineering needs.

---

## Framework Review Cadence

Periodic review MAY occur even when no release is required.

Review can assess:

* obsolete content;
* implementation gaps;
* recurring incidents;
* security evolution;
* ecosystem growth.

Review does not automatically require a new version.

---

## Lifecycle Maturity

The Release Framework itself may mature through:

```text
Stage 1
documented framework

Stage 2
manual adoption

Stage 3
validated profiles

Stage 4
automated enforcement

Stage 5
structured release evidence

Stage 6
policy-driven governance

Stage 7
supply-chain integration

Stage 8
continuous framework feedback
```

---

## Framework Lifecycle Invariants

The following invariants apply.

### FL1 — Every official Release Framework revision has an explicit identity.

### FL2 — Normative changes are distinguishable from editorial changes.

### FL3 — Significant framework changes are validated before release.

### FL4 — Normative framework changes require explicit governance approval.

### FL5 — Released framework versions remain historically interpretable.

### FL6 — Breaking framework changes include migration considerations.

### FL7 — Framework deprecation does not erase historical authority.

### FL8 — Active release practice should conform to the active framework version.

### FL9 — Framework implementation gaps remain visible.

### FL10 — Framework changes must consider downstream ecosystem impact.

### FL11 — The framework should progressively apply its own release principles to itself.

### FL12 — Framework evolution must remain traceable.

---

## Framework Lifecycle Anti-Patterns

### Silent Normative Edit

Changing a mandatory release requirement without a new governed framework revision.

---

### Documentation Equals Activation

Assuming that editing Markdown automatically changes active release policy.

---

### Retroactive Governance

Applying new framework rules to historical releases as if those rules existed at the time.

---

### Eternal Draft

Allowing unreleased framework rules to influence production indefinitely.

---

### Unversioned Breaking Change

Changing release semantics without explicit version impact.

---

### Framework Forking

Creating separate incompatible release rule sets for each subsystem without strong architectural justification.

---

### Tool-Led Framework

Changing framework rules simply to match whatever a current CI/CD tool happens to support.

---

### Untracked Implementation Drift

Allowing real release workflows to diverge from framework rules without recording the gap.

---

### Delete Old Framework

Removing superseded framework versions and making historical release interpretation impossible.

---

## Minimum Framework Lifecycle

At minimum, every official EPIC-REL-001 revision should follow:

```text
PROPOSE
   ↓
DRAFT
   ↓
VALIDATE
   ↓
APPROVE
   ↓
VERSION
   ↓
RELEASE
   ↓
MAINTAIN
```

and eventually:

```text
SUPERSEDE
   ↓
DEPRECATE
   ↓
ARCHIVE
```

where applicable.

---

## Current EPIC-REL-001 Lifecycle

The initial EPIC-REL-001 release currently follows the FamilyOS framework milestone model.

Conceptually:

```text
existing legacy structure
      ↓
audit
      ↓
canonical restructuring
      ↓
release-specific documentation
      ↓
framework validation
      ↓
control document alignment
      ↓
final commit
      ↓
official version
      ↓
annotated tag
      ↓
remote publication
```

Once released, this framework becomes the normative foundation for later release lifecycle improvements.

---

## Initial Bootstrap Release

The first official EPIC-REL-001 release is a bootstrap release.

It formalizes practices that already exist while defining a more mature future architecture.

Therefore:

```text
existing FamilyOS release discipline
      ↓
creates
Release Framework v1
      ↓
Release Framework v1
governs future release evolution
```

This transition is intentional.

---

## Framework Success Criteria

The Release Framework lifecycle is healthy when FamilyOS can answer:

```text
Which framework version is active?

Which version governed a historical release?

What changed between framework versions?

Which changes were normative?

What migration was required?

Which implementation gaps remain?

Which framework superseded the previous one?
```

---

## Target Framework Lifecycle Experience

At higher maturity, tooling should be able to report:

```text
FamilyOS Release Framework

Version              2.1.0
Status               ACTIVE
Previous Version     2.0.0
Change Type          COMPATIBLE

Validation           PASS
Governance Approval  GRANTED
Implementation       92%
Open Migration Items 2
Deprecated Rules     1

Framework State      HEALTHY
```

This is a future capability, not an immediate implementation requirement.

---

## Relationship With Release Governance

`21-Release-Governance.md` defines who may approve framework changes, deprecation, replacement, and exceptions.

This document defines when those decisions occur in the framework lifecycle.

---

## Relationship With Release Compliance

`22-Release-Compliance.md` evaluates whether active release implementations conform to the active framework.

Framework lifecycle changes may therefore alter future compliance requirements.

---

## Relationship With Release Metrics

`23-Release-Metrics.md` can provide evidence about framework effectiveness and implementation maturity.

---

## Relationship With Release Risk Management

`24-Release-Risk-Management.md` applies to risks introduced by framework changes as well as individual releases.

---

## Relationship With Roadmap

`26-Roadmap.md` defines how future Release Framework capabilities are expected to evolve.

This document defines the controlled lifecycle through which roadmap capabilities become normative framework behavior.

---

## Relationship With Validation

`28-Validation.md` defines the final validation state for EPIC-REL-001 itself.

Framework lifecycle requires that validation before official release.

---

## Relationship With Release

`30-Release.md` records the concrete release state of the current EPIC-REL-001 milestone.

This document defines the general lifecycle that future framework releases must follow.

---

## Relationship With Implementation Checklist

`31-Implementation-Checklist.md` records whether the framework definition and required implementation obligations have been satisfied.

Framework lifecycle uses that evidence before release completion.

---

## Final Statement

The FamilyOS Framework Lifecycle establishes EPIC-REL-001 as a maintained, versioned, governed engineering capability rather than static documentation.

It defines how release rules are proposed, drafted, validated, approved, released, activated, maintained, superseded, deprecated, retired, and archived.

By applying explicit lifecycle management to the Release Framework itself, FamilyOS ensures that its release architecture can evolve without losing historical meaning, compatibility awareness, governance, or traceability.

The Release Framework must govern change across FamilyOS.

It must therefore govern its own change with the same discipline.
