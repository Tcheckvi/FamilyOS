# Release Framework

## 12 Release Validation

### Overview

EPIC-REL-001 — Release Framework defines Release Validation as the formal qualification of the exact Release Candidate intended for approval and publication.

Release Validation answers the question:

> Does this exact candidate satisfy the applicable requirements to become an official FamilyOS release?

Release Validation occurs after Release Readiness and Release Candidate creation.

It must therefore evaluate a specific, identifiable candidate rather than a moving development state.

The lifecycle relationship is:

```text
READY
   ↓
CANDIDATE
   ↓
[ RELEASE VALIDATION ]
   ↓
VALIDATED
   ↓
APPROVED
```

Release Validation is one of the most important control boundaries in the FamilyOS release process.

---

## Purpose

The Release Validation model establishes:

* validation scope;
* validation profiles;
* candidate verification;
* source verification;
* artifact verification;
* provenance verification;
* version verification;
* testing evidence verification;
* quality verification;
* security verification;
* compliance verification;
* documentation verification;
* compatibility verification;
* installation and upgrade verification;
* validation evidence;
* validation failure handling;
* validation invalidation;
* validation approval boundaries.

The objective is to ensure that the exact candidate considered for release is demonstrably suitable for the intended release profile.

---

## Validation Principle

The central principle is:

> Validate the candidate that will actually be released.

The following model is invalid:

```text
candidate A
   ↓
validate
   ↓
change artifacts
   ↓
publish candidate B
```

unless renewed validation establishes that candidate B satisfies the applicable release requirements.

The preferred model is:

```text
candidate A
   ↓
validate candidate A
   ↓
approve candidate A
   ↓
publish candidate A
```

---

## Release Readiness vs Release Validation

Release Readiness and Release Validation perform different roles.

Release Readiness asks:

> Are the prerequisites satisfied to create a formal candidate?

Release Validation asks:

> Has the exact candidate passed final qualification?

Conceptually:

```text
Release Planning
      ↓
Release Readiness
      ↓
Candidate Creation
      ↓
Release Validation
      ↓
Release Approval
```

Readiness cannot replace final candidate validation.

---

## Validation Target

Every validation execution MUST identify the candidate being validated.

At minimum, the validation target should include:

```text
candidate identifier
source revision
target version
release scope
artifact set where applicable
release profile
```

Without a stable target, validation evidence becomes ambiguous.

---

## Validation Profile

Validation requirements depend on release type, channel, scope, and risk.

FamilyOS may define validation profiles such as:

```text
framework-release
documentation-release
plugin-release
platform-release
maintenance-release
security-release
emergency-release
```

A profile defines which validation domains are mandatory.

---

## Validation Domains

The canonical validation domains are:

```text
Candidate Identity
Source
Repository State
Build
Artifacts
Provenance
Version
Testing
Quality
Security
Compliance
Documentation
Compatibility
Installation
Upgrade
Migration
Recovery
Publication Preparation
```

Not every release requires all domains.

Applicable requirements must be explicit.

---

## Validation Outcome

Release Validation must produce an explicit result.

Canonical outcomes are:

```text
PASS
FAIL
BLOCKED
EXCEPTION_REQUIRED
```

A candidate may transition to `VALIDATED` only when mandatory requirements are satisfied and any allowed exceptions are approved.

---

## PASS

`PASS` means:

* all mandatory validation requirements succeeded;
* candidate identity is stable;
* required evidence exists;
* blocking findings are absent;
* required exceptions are approved.

The candidate may progress toward release approval.

---

## FAIL

`FAIL` means one or more validation requirements failed in a way that invalidates the candidate.

Typical response:

```text
CANDIDATE
   ↓
VALIDATION FAIL
   ↓
REJECTED
   ↓
correction
   ↓
new candidate
```

---

## BLOCKED

`BLOCKED` means validation cannot complete because a prerequisite or external condition is unresolved.

Examples include:

* required environment unavailable;
* dependency inaccessible;
* required approval unavailable;
* test infrastructure failure;
* missing candidate artifact.

Blocked validation is not equivalent to passed validation.

---

## EXCEPTION_REQUIRED

`EXCEPTION_REQUIRED` means a requirement is not satisfied but applicable governance permits a controlled exception.

Until the exception is formally accepted:

```text
validation != PASS
```

---

## Candidate Identity Validation

The first responsibility of Release Validation is confirming that the candidate identity is unambiguous.

Checks may include:

* candidate identifier exists;
* target version exists;
* source revision is recorded;
* release profile is known;
* artifact inventory is known;
* candidate state has not changed unexpectedly.

Example:

```text
Candidate            5.2.0-rc.3
Target Version       5.2.0
Source Revision      abc123
Release Profile      platform-stable
Artifact Set         IDENTIFIED

CANDIDATE IDENTITY   PASS
```

---

## Candidate Stability Validation

The validator should determine whether the candidate materially changed since qualification began.

Checks may include:

* source commit unchanged;
* artifact digests unchanged;
* dependency state unchanged;
* build identity unchanged;
* release configuration unchanged.

A material difference invalidates relevant validation evidence.

---

## Source Validation

Source Validation confirms that the candidate originates from the expected controlled source state.

Checks may include:

* repository identity;
* source revision existence;
* expected branch lineage;
* required commit availability;
* absence of unresolved source ambiguity.

For Git-based releases:

```text
Repository
   ↓
Commit
   ↓
Candidate
```

must remain traceable.

---

## Repository State Validation

Repository validation may verify:

* expected branch;
* expected HEAD;
* clean working tree where required;
* remote synchronization;
* no unresolved conflicts;
* no accidental untracked release files;
* tag availability;
* version consistency.

The exact rules depend on lifecycle stage.

---

## Repository Validation Example

```text
Branch                PASS
HEAD                  PASS
Working Tree          CLEAN
Remote Commit         VERIFIED
Tag Conflict          NONE
Repository Structure PASS

REPOSITORY VALIDATION PASS
```

---

## Build Validation

Where release artifacts require a build, validation must confirm that the applicable Build Framework requirements have been satisfied.

Build validation may include:

* successful build execution;
* expected build configuration;
* expected artifact generation;
* reproducibility evidence where required;
* build metadata availability.

The Release Framework consumes Build Framework evidence rather than redefining build behavior.

---

## Artifact Validation

Artifact Validation confirms that the candidate contains the expected release artifacts.

Checks may include:

* artifact count;
* artifact names;
* artifact types;
* artifact versions;
* checksums;
* packaging;
* metadata;
* absence of unintended artifacts.

---

## Artifact Validation Example

```text
Expected Artifacts       4
Actual Artifacts         4
Version Metadata         PASS
Checksums                PASS
Unexpected Artifacts     0
Missing Artifacts        0

ARTIFACT VALIDATION      PASS
```

---

## Artifact Integrity Validation

Where integrity records exist, validation should confirm:

```text
recorded checksum
=
actual candidate checksum
```

Integrity failure is normally a release blocker.

An unexplained checksum change indicates that the artifact identity changed.

---

## Provenance Validation

Provenance Validation verifies that release artifacts can be traced to their expected origin.

Checks may include:

* artifact → build relationship;
* build → source relationship;
* candidate → artifact relationship;
* version → candidate relationship.

Canonical chain:

```text
Source
  ↓
Build
  ↓
Artifact
  ↓
Candidate
  ↓
Release
```

Any broken link requires investigation.

---

## Provenance Validation Example

```text
Source Revision        VERIFIED
Build Identity         VERIFIED
Artifact Source        VERIFIED
Candidate Binding      VERIFIED
Checksum Binding       VERIFIED

PROVENANCE             PASS
```

---

## Version Validation

Version Validation verifies compliance with `06-Versioning-Strategy.md`.

Checks may include:

* syntax;
* semantic increment;
* uniqueness;
* candidate relationship;
* tag compatibility;
* metadata consistency.

Example:

```text
Previous Version      5.1.0
Candidate             5.2.0-rc.3
Target Version        5.2.0
Increment             MINOR
Syntax                PASS
Ordering              PASS
Uniqueness            PASS

VERSION VALIDATION    PASS
```

---

## Version Consistency

The final version should remain consistent across applicable locations.

Examples include:

```text
project metadata
artifact metadata
release manifest
release notes
changelog
tag intent
```

Conflicting version information must block final qualification until resolved.

---

## Testing Validation

Release Validation should verify that mandatory testing evidence applies to the candidate.

Applicable testing may include:

* unit testing;
* integration testing;
* functional testing;
* system testing;
* regression testing;
* contract testing;
* compatibility testing;
* performance testing.

The Testing Framework remains authoritative for test methodology.

---

## Test Evidence Validation

The Release Framework must confirm:

```text
required tests executed
required tests passed
evidence corresponds to candidate state
blocking failures absent
```

A stale test run must not automatically satisfy final validation.

---

## Testing Example

```text
Unit Tests             PASS
Integration Tests      PASS
Regression Tests       PASS
System Tests           PASS
Required Scope         COMPLETE
Candidate Revision     MATCH

TEST VALIDATION        PASS
```

---

## Static Analysis Validation

Applicable releases may require static checks such as:

* Ruff;
* MyPy;
* formatting validation;
* security analysis;
* dependency analysis.

These should be treated as quality or security evidence according to framework ownership.

---

## Quality Validation

Quality Validation confirms applicable EPIC-QLT-001 requirements.

Possible evidence includes:

* quality gates;
* static quality checks;
* defect review;
* quality debt status;
* required quality metrics.

Example:

```text
Linting              PASS
Type Checking        PASS
Quality Gates        PASS
Blocking Defects     0
Accepted Defects     DOCUMENTED

QUALITY VALIDATION   PASS
```

---

## Defect Validation

Open defects must be classified before release approval.

A defect may be:

```text
BLOCKING
NON_BLOCKING
ACCEPTED
DEFERRED
```

Blocking defects prevent validation success.

Accepted defects must be documented where applicable.

---

## Security Validation

Security Validation confirms that applicable release security requirements are satisfied.

Possible checks include:

* vulnerability findings;
* credential exposure;
* dependency security;
* artifact integrity;
* release permissions;
* provenance;
* security-sensitive configuration;
* required security approvals.

High-risk releases may require stronger security evidence.

---

## Security Validation Example

```text
Critical Findings     0
High Blocking Issues  0
Secrets Exposure      NONE
Artifact Integrity    PASS
Security Approval     PASS

SECURITY VALIDATION   PASS
```

---

## Security Exception

Security exceptions require explicit governance.

Critical security controls may be non-exceptionable depending on policy.

Release urgency alone is not sufficient justification for bypassing essential security validation.

---

## Compliance Validation

Release Compliance Validation confirms that the candidate satisfies applicable compliance requirements.

For official plugins, this may include:

* plugin structure;
* metadata;
* reserved domains;
* capabilities;
* policies;
* rules;
* recipes;
* documentation;
* compliance findings.

---

## Compliance Example

```text
Compliance Profile   official-plugin
Mandatory Rules      PASS
Blocking Findings    0
Warnings              REVIEWED
Exceptions            0

COMPLIANCE            PASS
```

---

## Documentation Validation

Documentation Validation confirms that required release documentation is complete and consistent with the candidate.

Checks may include:

* changelog;
* release notes;
* migration guidance;
* known issues;
* compatibility notes;
* security notices;
* framework documentation;
* cross-references.

---

## Documentation Consistency

Release documentation must describe the actual candidate.

The following mismatch is invalid:

```text
release notes:
feature X included

candidate:
feature X removed
```

The documentation must be corrected before release completion.

---

## Framework Validation

For FamilyOS framework releases, validation should include:

* canonical file structure;
* numbering;
* no unintended duplicate numbers;
* no empty required documents;
* control document alignment;
* normative consistency;
* heading consistency;
* references;
* framework scope;
* implementation checklist status.

---

## Compatibility Validation

Compatibility Validation evaluates the candidate against applicable compatibility contracts.

Examples include:

```text
platform ↔ plugin
API ↔ consumer
schema ↔ data
configuration ↔ runtime
CLI ↔ interface
```

Known compatibility breaks must be consistent with versioning and documentation.

---

## Compatibility Matrix

A future release may use a compatibility matrix.

Example:

```text
Component               Candidate      Compatibility

FamilyOS Platform       5.2.0          -
Finance Plugin          3.1.0          PASS
Security Plugin         4.0.2          PASS
Documents Plugin        2.8.0          PASS
```

The exact format is implementation-specific.

---

## Installation Validation

Where applicable, a Release Candidate should be tested through the same installation path intended for consumers.

Checks may include:

* package installation;
* dependency resolution;
* initial execution;
* configuration initialization;
* plugin discovery.

An artifact that builds successfully but cannot be installed is not a valid releasable artifact.

---

## Clean Environment Validation

Installation should preferably be tested in a controlled clean environment.

This reduces hidden dependency on:

* developer workstation state;
* previously installed packages;
* local configuration;
* untracked files.

---

## Upgrade Validation

For releases that replace a supported earlier version, upgrade validation may be required.

Example:

```text
5.1.0
   ↓
upgrade
   ↓
5.2.0 candidate
```

Checks may include:

* configuration compatibility;
* data compatibility;
* dependency migration;
* plugin compatibility;
* expected behavior after upgrade.

---

## Migration Validation

If a release includes migration procedures, those procedures must be tested where risk justifies it.

Migration validation may cover:

* schema migration;
* configuration migration;
* metadata migration;
* plugin migration;
* data transformation.

A migration guide should reflect validated procedures.

---

## Rollback Validation

Where rollback is part of the release strategy, validation should determine whether rollback actually works.

Conceptually:

```text
previous release
      ↓
candidate upgrade
      ↓
candidate operation
      ↓
rollback
      ↓
previous supported state
```

Rollback must not be assumed safe without evidence when operational risk is significant.

---

## Forward-Recovery Validation

Where rollback is impossible, release validation should verify that the defined forward-recovery approach is realistic.

This may include:

* corrective release capability;
* migration continuation;
* channel replacement;
* withdrawal mechanism.

---

## Publication Preparation Validation

Before release approval, final validation should confirm that publication can proceed safely.

Checks may include:

* target availability;
* credentials;
* permissions;
* target naming;
* expected artifact paths;
* tag name;
* version uniqueness;
* publication verification procedure.

No external side effect is required simply to validate preparation.

---

## Dry-Run Validation

Where practical, FamilyOS tooling SHOULD support a dry-run or equivalent validation mode.

A dry run may verify:

```text
target version
tag name
publication targets
artifact inventory
release notes
permissions
policy results
```

without publishing.

This helps discover failures before high-impact operations.

---

## Validation Ordering

Validation should generally perform lower-risk and lower-cost checks before high-impact operations.

A possible ordering is:

```text
identity
   ↓
repository
   ↓
version
   ↓
build
   ↓
artifacts
   ↓
tests
   ↓
quality
   ↓
security
   ↓
compliance
   ↓
documentation
   ↓
compatibility
   ↓
installation / upgrade
   ↓
final validation summary
```

The exact order may vary.

---

## Validation Dependency Graph

Validation results may depend on one another.

For example:

```text
Source Change
   ↓
Build Invalidated
   ↓
Artifact Invalidated
   ↓
Test Evidence Invalidated
   ↓
Candidate Validation Invalidated
```

Future automation should model these dependencies explicitly.

---

## Validation Freshness

Validation evidence must be sufficiently fresh relative to the candidate.

Evidence becomes stale when relevant candidate state changes.

Examples include:

* source change;
* dependency change;
* artifact rebuild;
* configuration change;
* security status change.

---

## Validation Invalidation

A material candidate change after successful validation MUST invalidate affected validation results.

Possible outcomes:

```text
VALIDATED
   ↓
candidate changed
   ↓
CANDIDATE
   ↓
revalidate
```

or a new candidate identity may be required.

---

## Partial Revalidation

Some non-source changes may permit partial revalidation.

Example:

```text
release note correction

Build             remains valid
Tests             remain valid
Artifacts         remain valid
Documentation     revalidate
```

Partial revalidation must be justified by evidence dependencies.

---

## Full Revalidation

Full revalidation should normally occur after:

* source change;
* artifact replacement;
* dependency change;
* build configuration change;
* significant release profile change;
* compatibility-impacting change.

---

## Validation Evidence

Validation should produce a durable evidence summary.

Conceptually:

```text
ReleaseValidation
├── candidate
├── source
├── artifacts
├── checks
├── results
├── findings
├── exceptions
├── timestamp
└── final result
```

---

## Validation Report

A future FamilyOS validation report may look like:

```text
FamilyOS Release Validation

Candidate            5.2.0-rc.3
Target Version       5.2.0
Profile              platform-stable
Source Revision      abc123

Candidate Identity   PASS
Repository           PASS
Build                PASS
Artifacts            PASS
Provenance           PASS
Version              PASS
Testing              PASS
Quality              PASS
Security             PASS
Compliance           PASS
Documentation        PASS
Compatibility        PASS
Installation         PASS
Upgrade              PASS
Recovery             PASS

Blocking Findings    0
Exceptions           0

RESULT               VALIDATED
```

---

## Failed Validation Report

Example:

```text
FamilyOS Release Validation

Candidate            5.2.0-rc.2

Artifacts            PASS
Testing              FAIL
Security             PASS
Documentation        PASS

Blocking Findings    1

Finding:
Integration regression

RESULT               FAILED

Candidate promotion prohibited.
```

---

## Validation Findings

A validation finding should contain:

```text
domain
requirement
severity
evidence
status
remediation
```

This supports traceability and remediation.

---

## Finding Severity

Possible severity categories may include:

```text
INFO
WARNING
MAJOR
CRITICAL
```

or another model defined by FamilyOS quality/compliance governance.

Severity semantics must remain explicit.

---

## Blocking Findings

Any finding designated as blocking prevents transition to `VALIDATED`.

Blocking findings must be:

* fixed;
* shown to be invalid;
* governed through an allowed exception.

---

## Warning Findings

Warnings may permit release progression.

However, they should be reviewed and recorded.

Warnings must not become a mechanism for downgrading true blockers.

---

## Validation Exceptions

An exception must identify:

* failed requirement;
* reason;
* risk;
* compensating controls;
* authority;
* candidate;
* scope.

An exception applies to the specific release context.

It does not permanently redefine policy.

---

## Exception Invalidation

An exception may become invalid if:

* candidate changes;
* release scope changes;
* risk increases;
* target channel changes;
* security context changes.

Exceptions must be reevaluated when their assumptions no longer hold.

---

## Validation Authority

Release Validation may be performed by:

* automated pipelines;
* release tooling;
* maintainers;
* domain-specific validators;
* security tooling;
* compliance engines.

No single implementation mechanism is required.

The result must remain explicit and trustworthy.

---

## Automated Validation

Deterministic checks should be automated where practical.

Examples include:

* version syntax;
* tag availability;
* repository cleanliness;
* artifact checksums;
* file structure;
* test execution;
* static checks;
* metadata consistency.

---

## Human Validation

Human review remains appropriate for:

* architectural consistency;
* release note quality;
* migration clarity;
* risk assessment;
* complex compatibility decisions;
* exception review.

Automation should not replace necessary engineering judgment.

---

## Validation Independence

Higher-risk releases may benefit from some separation between:

```text
candidate creator
```

and:

```text
candidate validator
```

The degree of independence depends on governance and release risk.

---

## Validation Reproducibility

A validation process should be repeatable enough that equivalent candidate inputs produce equivalent decisions where objective rules apply.

Differences in validation outcome should be explainable.

---

## Local Validation

Local validation may be valuable for early release preparation.

Examples include:

```text
pytest
ruff check .
mypy src
documentation checks
```

Local success may not satisfy every authoritative release profile.

---

## CI Validation

CI/CD may provide authoritative repeatable validation.

Benefits include:

* controlled environment;
* durable logs;
* standardized commands;
* reproducible execution;
* stronger separation from local state.

CI is an implementation mechanism, not the source of release policy.

---

## Validation Environment

For significant releases, the validation environment should be controlled.

Relevant properties may include:

* operating system;
* runtime version;
* dependency state;
* build tooling;
* environment variables;
* external services.

Hidden environment dependencies reduce confidence.

---

## Multi-Environment Validation

Some platform releases may require validation across multiple environments.

Examples:

```text
macOS
Linux
Windows
Python versions
architecture variants
```

The applicable support matrix determines required coverage.

---

## Release Validation and Build Once

The preferred high-integrity model is:

```text
build artifact
      ↓
candidate
      ↓
validate artifact
      ↓
approve
      ↓
publish same artifact
```

This minimizes release drift.

---

## Validation and Publication

Validation MUST complete before protected publication operations unless an explicit release profile defines a controlled alternative.

Final publication should not be used as the mechanism for discovering basic release validity.

---

## Post-Publication Validation

Some validation can only occur after publication.

Examples include:

* package registry resolution;
* public download;
* mirror verification;
* stable channel resolution.

These checks are post-publication verification and complement pre-publication Release Validation.

---

## Validation and Approval

`VALIDATED` is not the same as `APPROVED`.

Validation establishes technical and policy qualification.

Approval establishes release authority.

Conceptually:

```text
VALIDATED
   ↓
governance decision
   ↓
APPROVED
```

This distinction must remain explicit.

---

## Validation and Risk

A technically valid candidate may still carry unacceptable release risk.

For example:

```text
all automated checks pass
+
migration risk unacceptable
=
release may remain unapproved
```

Release Risk Management remains a separate governance input.

---

## Validation and Evidence Retention

Final release validation evidence should be retained long enough to support:

* release history;
* incident analysis;
* compliance;
* debugging;
* security investigation;
* historical reconstruction.

---

## Framework Release Validation

For a FamilyOS framework release, final validation should normally include:

```text
canonical structure
numbered document completeness
control document completeness
no empty required documents
no duplicate numbering
content coherence
normative consistency
cross-reference consistency
EPIC.yaml alignment
MANIFEST alignment
VALIDATION state
CHANGELOG state
Revision-History state
repository state
version consistency
tag availability
```

---

## EPIC-REL-001 Self-Validation

Before EPIC-REL-001 is closed, its own release validation should verify:

```text
00-31 documents                 COMPLETE
release-specific architecture  CONSISTENT
duplicate numbers              NONE
empty numbered documents       NONE
control documents              ALIGNED
release terminology            CONSISTENT
cross-references               VALID
implementation checklist       COMPLETE
repository state               CLEAN
intended version               VALID
intended tag                   AVAILABLE
```

The actual evidence must be collected at closure time.

---

## Plugin Release Validation

A plugin release may require:

```text
plugin build             PASS
plugin unit tests        PASS
integration tests        PASS
plugin compliance        PASS
metadata                 PASS
capabilities             PASS
platform compatibility   PASS
artifact integrity       PASS
documentation            PASS
```

---

## Platform Release Validation

A platform release may require the broadest validation profile:

```text
build
unit tests
integration tests
system tests
regression
quality
security
compliance
plugin compatibility
artifact provenance
installation
upgrade
documentation
release notes
recovery
```

---

## Security Release Validation

A security release may add:

* vulnerability reproduction where safe;
* remediation verification;
* regression verification;
* advisory accuracy;
* restricted evidence handling;
* artifact integrity;
* coordinated disclosure checks.

Accelerated release timing must not remove essential security qualification.

---

## Emergency Release Validation

An emergency release may use focused validation.

The minimum profile should still establish:

```text
candidate identity
source traceability
fix verification
critical regression coverage
security as applicable
version correctness
artifact integrity
publication readiness
recovery
```

The reduced scope must be explicitly governed.

---

## Validation Metrics

FamilyOS may later track:

* validation duration;
* validation failure rate;
* candidate rejection rate;
* repeated failure domains;
* exception frequency;
* stale evidence incidents;
* post-release defects escaping validation.

Metrics should improve validation quality rather than incentivize superficial success.

---

## Validation Maturity

FamilyOS release validation may evolve through:

```text
Stage 1
manual final checklist

Stage 2
standardized validation commands

Stage 3
automated validation profiles

Stage 4
structured validation reports

Stage 5
evidence binding to candidate identity

Stage 6
policy-driven validation

Stage 7
provenance-aware validation

Stage 8
automated release qualification
```

---

## Validation Invariants

The following invariants apply.

### RV1 — Release Validation targets an explicit candidate.

### RV2 — Validation evidence must correspond to the candidate being qualified.

### RV3 — Material candidate changes invalidate affected validation.

### RV4 — Blocking findings prevent validation success.

### RV5 — Exceptions require explicit governance.

### RV6 — Artifact integrity must be validated where applicable.

### RV7 — Version consistency must be validated.

### RV8 — Required testing evidence must be verified.

### RV9 — Required quality, security, compliance, and documentation evidence must be verified.

### RV10 — Validation does not itself grant release approval.

### RV11 — Validation results must be explicit and auditable.

### RV12 — Published content must not materially differ from the validated candidate without renewed qualification.

---

## Validation Anti-Patterns

### Validate Branch Tip

Validating a mutable branch rather than an identifiable candidate.

---

### Stale Test Approval

Using old test results after candidate source changed.

---

### Build-Only Validation

Treating successful package creation as sufficient release qualification.

---

### Checklist Without Evidence

Marking validation items complete without supporting results.

---

### Rebuild After Pass

Publishing newly rebuilt artifacts after candidate validation without verification.

---

### Validation Equals Approval

Automatically assuming that technically valid means authorized for publication.

---

### Exception by Silence

Ignoring failed validation requirements because they appear low risk.

---

### Post-Publication Discovery

Using production publication as the primary method for finding basic packaging or compatibility failures.

---

## Minimum Validation Model

At minimum, an official FamilyOS release should validate:

```text
candidate identity
source identity
version
required tests
required quality checks
required documentation
artifact identity where applicable
repository consistency
blocking findings
```

before progressing to final approval.

---

## Target Validation Experience

At higher maturity, the release system should provide a command or equivalent capability that produces:

```text
FamilyOS Release Validation

Candidate            6.0.0-rc.2
Profile              platform-stable

Identity             PASS
Source               PASS
Repository           PASS
Build                PASS
Artifacts            PASS
Provenance           PASS
Version              PASS
Testing              PASS
Quality              PASS
Security             PASS
Compliance           PASS
Documentation        PASS
Compatibility        PASS
Installation         PASS
Upgrade              PASS
Recovery             PASS

Blocking Findings    0
Exceptions           0

RESULT               VALIDATED

Candidate may proceed to release approval.
```

The simplicity of the result should be supported by detailed evidence underneath it.

## Relationship With Release Candidates

`10-Release-Candidates.md` defines the exact object being validated.

This document defines how that object is qualified.

---

## Relationship With Artifacts and Provenance

`11-Artifacts-and-Provenance.md` provides the artifact identity and traceability model used during validation.

---

## Relationship With Release Automation

`13-Release-Automation.md` defines how deterministic validation steps may become repeatable automated operations.

---

## Relationship With CI/CD Integration

`14-CI-CD-Integration.md` defines how authoritative validation can be executed and preserved within pipeline environments.

---

## Relationship With Governance

`21-Release-Governance.md` defines the authority required to accept findings, approve exceptions, and authorize progression after validation.

---

## Relationship With Release Compliance

`22-Release-Compliance.md` defines release-specific conformance evaluation and how compliance findings participate in final qualification.

---

## Relationship With Release Risk Management

`24-Release-Risk-Management.md` defines how remaining risk is evaluated after technical validation.

---

## Final Statement

The FamilyOS Release Validation model establishes the final technical and policy qualification boundary before release approval.

It ensures that validation applies to a precise Release Candidate, that source, artifacts, provenance, versioning, testing, quality, security, compliance, documentation, compatibility, installation, upgrade, and recovery expectations are verified according to the applicable release profile, and that failures remain visible.

Release Validation therefore converts a prepared candidate into an evidence-backed candidate that is eligible for governance approval.

It does not guarantee publication by itself.

It provides the confidence required for an authorized release decision.
