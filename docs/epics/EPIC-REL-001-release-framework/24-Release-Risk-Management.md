# Release Framework

## 24 Release Risk Management

### Overview

Release risk management is the capability to identify, assess, control, monitor, and reduce the risks introduced by FamilyOS releases.

Every release changes the operational state of the platform.

That change may introduce risk through:

* application behavior;
* configuration;
* dependencies;
* database migrations;
* infrastructure;
* security posture;
* plugin compatibility;
* deployment strategy;
* operational complexity;
* incomplete observability;
* rollback limitations;
* compliance deviations.

The FamilyOS Release Framework therefore requires release risk to be treated explicitly.

Risk must not remain an informal assumption held only by individual engineers.

It must become part of release planning, readiness, approval, deployment, observation, and recovery.

The governing principle is:

> Every significant FamilyOS release must have its risks identified, understood, controlled, and accepted before production deployment.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of release risk management is to establish a consistent model for evaluating and governing release-related risk.

The framework defines expectations for:

* risk identification;
* risk classification;
* likelihood assessment;
* impact assessment;
* risk scoring;
* risk ownership;
* mitigation;
* residual risk;
* acceptance;
* escalation;
* release gating;
* deployment strategy;
* rollback readiness;
* observability;
* migration risk;
* dependency risk;
* security risk;
* plugin risk;
* operational risk;
* exception risk;
* post-release review.

Risk management must support engineering judgment rather than replace it.

---

## Release Risk Principle

Release risk is determined by both the probability of failure and the consequences of failure.

Conceptually:

```text
Release Risk
     =
Likelihood
     ×
Impact
```

However, numerical scoring alone is insufficient.

Two releases with the same calculated score may require different controls because their failure modes differ.

The framework therefore combines:

* structured classification;
* engineering analysis;
* automated evidence;
* governance judgment.

---

## Risk Management Lifecycle

Release risk management must operate throughout the release lifecycle.

```text

      |
      v

      |
      v

      |
      v
Risk Review
```

Risk management must begin before release readiness review.

---

## Risk Identification

Risk identification determines what could go wrong because of the release.

Potential risk sources include:

* new functionality;
* changed functionality;
* deleted functionality;
* schema changes;
* configuration changes;
* dependency upgrades;
* infrastructure changes;
* authentication changes;
* authorization changes;
* data transformations;
* API changes;
* plugin changes;
* migration scripts;
* operational procedures;
* external integrations.

Risk identification should focus on credible failure modes.

It should not attempt to enumerate every theoretically possible event.

---

## Risk Statement

Significant risks should be expressed clearly.

A useful risk statement describes:

```text
Cause
  |
  v
Failure Event
  |
  v
Impact
```

For example:

```text
If the database migration introduces a schema incompatible
with the previous application version,
rollback may fail and extend production recovery time.
```

Clear risk statements improve mitigation quality.

---

## Risk Categories

FamilyOS release risks should be classified consistently.

Recommended categories include:

```text
FUNCTIONAL
QUALITY
SECURITY
DATA
MIGRATION
DEPENDENCY
COMPATIBILITY
CONFIGURATION
DEPLOYMENT
INFRASTRUCTURE
PLUGIN
OBSERVABILITY
RECOVERY
COMPLIANCE
OPERATIONAL
```

Additional categories may be introduced when required.

---

## Functional Risk

Functional risk concerns incorrect or degraded business behavior.

Examples include:

* feature regression;
* incorrect workflow behavior;
* broken command behavior;
* failed domain operations;
* incorrect plugin capability execution.

Functional risk is primarily mitigated through testing, staged delivery, and runtime verification.

---

## Quality Risk

Quality risk concerns broader software quality characteristics.

Examples include:

* reliability degradation;
* maintainability problems;
* performance regressions;
* increased defect rate;
* unstable implementation.

Quality risk is governed jointly with the FamilyOS Quality Framework.

---

## Security Risk

Security risk concerns changes that may weaken the security posture.

Examples include:

* authentication regressions;
* authorization errors;
* dependency vulnerabilities;
* secret exposure;
* insecure configuration;
* privilege escalation;
* artifact integrity failure.

High or critical security risks require explicit security evaluation.

---

## Data Risk

Data risk concerns loss, corruption, unauthorized exposure, or inconsistent state.

Examples include:

* incorrect data transformation;
* destructive migration;
* incomplete write operations;
* incompatible serialization;
* invalid recovery assumptions.

Data risk must receive heightened attention because software rollback may not restore lost or corrupted data.

---

## Migration Risk

Migration risk concerns changes to persistent structures or state.

Examples include:

* database schema changes;
* data migration;
* storage format changes;
* index changes;
* state conversion.

Migration risk should consider:

* reversibility;
* compatibility;
* duration;
* data volume;
* recovery complexity.

---

## Dependency Risk

Dependency risk concerns internal or external dependencies.

Examples include:

* package upgrade;
* API version change;
* infrastructure dependency;
* runtime dependency;
* external service change.

Dependency risk must include both technical compatibility and supportability.

---

## Compatibility Risk

Compatibility risk concerns interaction between versions or components.

Examples include:

* API incompatibility;
* plugin incompatibility;
* schema incompatibility;
* client incompatibility;
* protocol incompatibility.

Compatibility risk is especially important during rolling or progressive deployments where multiple versions may coexist.

---

## Configuration Risk

Configuration risk concerns changes in runtime behavior caused by configuration.

Examples include:

* incorrect environment value;
* missing setting;
* wrong feature flag;
* invalid dependency endpoint;
* unsafe limit or threshold.

Configuration-only changes must still be considered release changes when they materially affect production behavior.

---

## Deployment Risk

Deployment risk concerns failure of the release activation process.

Examples include:

* incorrect deployment order;
* partial rollout;
* failed startup;
* unavailable artifact;
* invalid permissions;
* failed environment preparation.

Deployment risk must be evaluated independently from application-code risk.

---

## Infrastructure Risk

Infrastructure risk concerns changes to the environment supporting FamilyOS.

Examples include:

* compute changes;
* network changes;
* storage changes;
* container runtime changes;
* operating system changes;
* resource constraints.

Infrastructure changes can create release failures even when the application artifact is correct.

---

## Plugin Risk

FamilyOS is a plugin-oriented platform.

Plugin releases may introduce risks through:

* incompatible plugin interfaces;
* capability registration failure;
* contribution conflicts;
* invalid manifests;
* policy incompatibility;
* dependency incompatibility;
* plugin migration failure.

Plugin risk should be evaluated independently from core platform risk where appropriate.

---

## Observability Risk

Observability risk concerns insufficient ability to detect or understand release failures.

Examples include:

* missing metrics;
* invalid health checks;
* absent deployment markers;
* broken logging;
* missing alerts;
* inability to correlate telemetry with release identity.

A release can be technically correct but operationally unsafe if it cannot be observed.

---

## Recovery Risk

Recovery risk concerns the inability to restore a safe state after failure.

Examples include:

* missing rollback artifact;
* irreversible migration;
* incompatible previous release;
* untested recovery procedure;
* incomplete backups.

Recovery risk is a primary production release risk.

---

## Compliance Risk

Compliance risk concerns violation of applicable release controls.

Examples include:

* missing approval;
* failed security requirement;
* incomplete evidence;
* unauthorized artifact;
* absent release documentation.

Compliance risk must be explicitly represented rather than hidden within general operational risk.

---

## Operational Risk

Operational risk concerns the ability of people and processes to manage the release safely.

Examples include:

* unclear ownership;
* insufficient staffing;
* unavailable subject-matter experts;
* poorly documented procedures;
* manual error potential;
* release timing.

Operational context can significantly change the risk of an otherwise identical release.

---

## Risk Factors

The following factors should increase release risk where applicable:

* large change size;
* broad component scope;
* high user impact;
* critical data changes;
* irreversible migrations;
* breaking compatibility;
* new deployment architecture;
* major dependency upgrades;
* weak test coverage;
* incomplete observability;
* untested rollback;
* high operational complexity;
* significant security changes;
* first-time deployment path.

Risk classification should consider the complete change, not only code size.

---

## Risk Classification

FamilyOS releases should use a simple standardized risk classification.

Recommended levels are:

```text
LOW
MEDIUM
HIGH
CRITICAL
```

The classification must describe the release as a whole.

Individual risks may also receive separate severity levels.

---

## Low Risk

A low-risk release typically has:

* narrow scope;
* limited impact;
* no significant migration;
* strong automated validation;
* straightforward rollback;
* good observability;
* established deployment path.

Examples may include minor documentation or low-impact configuration changes.

---

## Medium Risk

A medium-risk release may include:

* moderate functional changes;
* several affected components;
* controlled dependency updates;
* reversible migrations;
* broader user impact.

It requires normal production release controls and explicit readiness review.

---

## High Risk

A high-risk release may include:

* major functionality;
* significant architecture change;
* database migration;
* security-sensitive changes;
* breaking compatibility;
* broad plugin impact;
* complex recovery.

High-risk releases require stronger validation and operational controls.

---

## Critical Risk

A critical-risk release may affect:

* core platform availability;
* security boundaries;
* irreversible production data;
* platform-wide compatibility;
* critical infrastructure;
* large-scale user access.

Critical-risk releases require explicit senior authorization and enhanced deployment safeguards.

---

## Likelihood Assessment

Likelihood describes how probable a failure is.

A simple model may use:

```text
RARE
UNLIKELY
POSSIBLE
LIKELY
ALMOST_CERTAIN
```

Likelihood should be informed by:

* test results;
* previous incidents;
* complexity;
* maturity of the change;
* dependency stability;
* deployment experience.

Likelihood must not be determined solely by intuition.

---

## Impact Assessment

Impact describes the consequence if the risk occurs.

Possible levels include:

```text
NEGLIGIBLE
MINOR
MODERATE
MAJOR
SEVERE
```

Impact analysis should consider:

* availability;
* user experience;
* security;
* data;
* recovery complexity;
* duration;
* scope;
* compliance.

---

## Risk Matrix

A risk matrix may combine likelihood and impact.

Example:

```text
                 Impact
             Low   Med   High  Severe
Likelihood
Low          LOW   LOW   MED   HIGH
Medium       LOW   MED   HIGH  HIGH
High         MED   HIGH  HIGH  CRITICAL
Very High    HIGH  HIGH  CRITICAL CRITICAL
```

The exact matrix may evolve.

The important requirement is consistent application.

---

## Risk Score

Where useful, FamilyOS may use a numeric score.

For example:

```text
risk_score =
likelihood_score
*
impact_score
```

Numeric scoring must remain secondary to the risk description.

A score without an understandable risk statement provides weak decision support.

---

## Risk Register

Significant release risks should be recorded in a release risk register.

A risk entry may include:

```text
risk_id
release_id
category
description
likelihood
impact
risk_level
mitigation
owner
residual_risk
status
```

The risk register should focus on material risks rather than administrative volume.

---

## Risk Ownership

Every significant release risk must have an owner.

The owner is responsible for:

* ensuring the risk is understood;
* coordinating mitigation;
* reporting unresolved concerns;
* verifying mitigation evidence;
* escalating when needed.

Risk ownership does not imply individual blame.

It establishes accountability for management of the risk.

---

## Risk Mitigation

Mitigation reduces likelihood, impact, or both.

Possible mitigations include:

* additional testing;
* narrower scope;
* feature flags;
* progressive delivery;
* compatibility layers;
* migration staging;
* stronger backups;
* improved observability;
* validated rollback;
* dependency pinning;
* additional review;
* delayed destructive changes.

Mitigation must be specific enough to verify.

---

## Preventive Controls

Preventive controls reduce the likelihood of a failure.

Examples include:

* static analysis;
* automated tests;
* dependency validation;
* schema compatibility validation;
* security scanning;
* release gates.

Preventive controls should act before production impact occurs.

---

## Detective Controls

Detective controls reduce time to discovery.

Examples include:

* health checks;
* alerts;
* release telemetry;
* logs;
* runtime validation;
* anomaly detection.

Detective controls become especially important where failure cannot be fully prevented.

---

## Corrective Controls

Corrective controls reduce the impact or duration of failure.

Examples include:

* rollback;
* forward recovery;
* feature deactivation;
* traffic switching;
* restore procedures;
* emergency patches.

A mature release strategy combines preventive, detective, and corrective controls.

---

## Residual Risk

Mitigation does not eliminate all risk.

The remaining risk is residual risk.

Conceptually:

```text
Initial Risk
     |
     v
Mitigation
     |
     v
Residual Risk
```

Residual risk must be evaluated before approval.

The question is not:

> Is there zero risk?

The correct question is:

> Is the remaining risk acceptable for this release?

---

## Risk Acceptance

Residual risk may be accepted when:

* controls are proportionate;
* mitigation is sufficient;
* impact is understood;
* appropriate authority accepts responsibility.

Risk acceptance must be explicit for significant risks.

It must not be inferred from silence.

---

## Risk Acceptance Record

A risk acceptance record should include:

```text
risk_id
release_id
residual_risk
reason
accepted_by
accepted_at
conditions
expiration
```

Temporary acceptance should include an expiration or review condition.

---

## Unacceptable Risk

Some release risks must block deployment.

Examples may include:

* known critical security vulnerability;
* unresolved data-loss risk;
* no recovery strategy for a destructive migration;
* unverified artifact integrity;
* major compliance violation;
* unknown production release state.

Release velocity must not override unacceptable risk.

---

## Risk Escalation

Risks should be escalated when:

* risk level exceeds team authority;
* mitigation is incomplete;
* impact is uncertain;
* residual risk remains high;
* security implications are significant;
* data integrity is threatened;
* release timing creates additional exposure.

Escalation should identify the decision required.

---

## Risk-Based Release Controls

Release controls should increase with risk.

Example:

```text
LOW
 |
 +-- standard validation
 +-- standard deployment

MEDIUM
 |
 +-- full validation
 +-- readiness review
 +-- rollback confirmation

HIGH
 |
 +-- enhanced testing
 +-- explicit risk review
 +-- progressive deployment
 +-- extended stabilization

CRITICAL
 |
 +-- senior approval
 +-- strongest validation
 +-- enhanced observability
 +-- recovery rehearsal
 +-- controlled exposure
```

This avoids applying the same level of process to every change.

---

## Release Readiness Integration

Risk management is a required part of release readiness.

A readiness assessment should confirm:

```text
[ ] Release risk classification assigned
[ ] Material risks identified
[ ] Risk owners assigned
[ ] Required mitigations completed
[ ] Residual risks evaluated
[ ] High risks explicitly accepted
[ ] Recovery risks understood
[ ] Observability supports risk monitoring
```

A release with unknown critical risks is not ready.

---

## Release Gate Integration

Risk may participate in automated or manual release gates.

Example:

```text
critical_open_risks == 0
unaccepted_high_risks == 0
mandatory_mitigations_complete == true
release_risk_approved == true
```

Automated gates can verify status.

Human judgment remains necessary for risk acceptance.

---

## Change Size Risk

Large releases increase uncertainty.

Large change sets may:

* affect more components;
* increase test complexity;
* increase regression probability;
* make diagnosis harder;
* increase rollback complexity.

Where practical, FamilyOS should prefer smaller independently releasable changes.

Small releases are not automatically low risk, but they are generally easier to understand and recover.

---

## Blast Radius

Blast radius describes how much of the system or user population may be affected by failure.

Blast radius may be reduced through:

* canary releases;
* staged rollout;
* feature flags;
* environment isolation;
* plugin isolation;
* traffic segmentation.

Reducing blast radius is one of the strongest release risk controls.

---

## Progressive Delivery as Risk Control

Progressive delivery limits exposure.

Example:

```text
Release Candidate
      |
      v
Canary
      |
      v
Observe
      |
   +--+--+
   |     |
  Fail  Pass
   |     |
   v     v
Stop   Expand
```

Progression should depend on observable evidence.

---

## Feature Flags as Risk Control

Feature flags may separate deployment from feature activation.

This can reduce risk by allowing:

* deployment without immediate exposure;
* gradual activation;
* rapid deactivation;
* isolated experimentation.

Feature flags introduce their own complexity and must be governed.

They are not a substitute for testing.

---

## Rollback as Risk Control

Rollback reduces the potential duration of release failure.

Rollback readiness should consider:

* previous stable version;
* artifact availability;
* compatibility;
* migration state;
* data state;
* configuration state.

A release with simple rollback has a different risk profile from an otherwise identical release with no safe rollback.

---

## Forward Recovery Risk

Some releases cannot be rolled back safely.

In those cases, forward recovery becomes critical.

Forward recovery risk should evaluate:

* expected repair time;
* patch deployment path;
* data correction capability;
* required expertise;
* operational complexity.

Forward-only recovery must be explicitly recognized before deployment.

---

## Migration Risk Controls

High-risk migrations should use controls such as:

* expand-and-contract;
* backward compatibility;
* pre-migration validation;
* backup verification;
* staged migration;
* dry runs;
* post-migration verification.

Destructive migration steps should occur only after compatibility windows where practical.

---

## Data Risk Controls

Data risk controls may include:

* backups;
* point-in-time recovery;
* validation queries;
* checksums;
* reconciliation;
* audit trails;
* transaction boundaries.

A release should never assume data can simply be recreated unless that assumption has been proven.

---

## Dependency Risk Controls

Dependency risk may be reduced through:

* version pinning;
* compatibility testing;
* health monitoring;
* fallback mechanisms;
* controlled upgrade sequencing;
* dependency rollback.

External dependencies should be treated as independent sources of failure.

---

## Security Risk Controls

Security risk mitigation may include:

* threat analysis;
* security review;
* vulnerability scanning;
* penetration testing;
* permission validation;
* secret validation;
* dependency assessment.

Critical security risk must not be normalized as routine release debt.

---

## Plugin Risk Controls

Plugin release risk may be reduced through:

* Plugin Compliance Framework validation;
* compatibility tests;
* isolated activation;
* capability validation;
* contribution validation;
* plugin-specific health signals;
* independent rollback.

Plugin architecture should limit failure propagation wherever possible.

---

## Observability as Risk Control

Observability reduces uncertainty.

Strong observability improves:

* detection;
* diagnosis;
* rollback decisions;
* recovery validation.

Observability does not prevent failure.

It reduces the risk of prolonged or misunderstood failure.

---

## Operational Timing Risk

Release timing may affect risk.

Risk may increase during:

* periods of low staffing;
* major external events;
* infrastructure maintenance;
* dependency maintenance windows;
* known traffic peaks.

The framework should avoid arbitrary release freezes.

However, timing context should be included in risk assessment.

---

## Human Factors

Release risk is influenced by human factors.

Examples include:

* fatigue;
* unclear procedures;
* unfamiliar deployment paths;
* excessive manual steps;
* poor communication;
* role ambiguity.

Critical releases should minimize unnecessary human complexity.

---

## Automation Risk

Automation reduces manual error but can amplify mistakes rapidly.

Automated release actions must therefore include:

* validation;
* bounded scope;
* permissions;
* observability;
* safe failure behavior.

Automation must not bypass release governance.

---

## Unknown Risk

Some uncertainty cannot be eliminated.

The framework must support explicit:

```text
UNKNOWN
```

or:

```text
UNCERTAIN
```

risk characteristics.

Unknowns should increase caution.

They must not be silently interpreted as low risk.

---

## Risk During Release

Risk assessment does not end at deployment authorization.

New evidence may change risk during rollout.

For example:

```text
Initial Risk: MEDIUM

Canary Error Rate Increase

Updated Risk: HIGH
```

The release process must be able to pause or stop when risk increases.

---

## Dynamic Risk Reassessment

Risk should be reassessed when:

* verification fails;
* telemetry changes significantly;
* dependencies degrade;
* migration behaves unexpectedly;
* security signals appear;
* rollback capability changes.

Dynamic reassessment supports evidence-based release control.

---

## Post-Release Risk

A release may remain risky after successful deployment.

Residual operational risks may include:

* unresolved known issues;
* temporary compatibility layers;
* temporary security exceptions;
* deferred migrations;
* feature flags awaiting activation.

These risks must remain tracked until resolved.

---

## Risk Closure

A risk should be closed only when:

* the risk no longer applies;
* mitigation is complete;
* the affected release is retired;
* the underlying issue is resolved.

Closing a release does not automatically close every associated risk.

---

## Risk Evidence

Risk decisions should be supported by evidence.

Potential evidence includes:

* test results;
* quality results;
* security scans;
* migration tests;
* performance tests;
* observability data;
* rollback tests;
* previous release history.

Risk assessment should become more evidence-based as FamilyOS matures.

---

## Historical Risk Data

Historical release outcomes should inform future risk classification.

For example:

```text
Major dependency upgrade
      +
Previous rollback history
      +
Low compatibility coverage
      |
      v
Higher initial risk
```

Historical evidence improves calibration.

---

## Risk Metrics

Useful release risk metrics include:

* releases by risk level;
* high-risk release success rate;
* critical-risk release count;
* unaccepted risk count;
* risk exception rate;
* rollback rate by risk level;
* change failure rate by risk level;
* average mitigation completion time;
* repeated risk category frequency.

Metrics should improve risk prediction and control.

---

## Risk Trends

Trend analysis may reveal systemic issues.

Examples include:

* increasing migration risk;
* repeated dependency failures;
* recurring plugin compatibility issues;
* increasing emergency risk acceptance;
* repeated observability gaps.

Trends should feed framework improvement.

---

## Risk Review

High-risk and critical releases should receive explicit risk review.

The review should answer:

* What can fail?
* What is the impact?
* What controls reduce the risk?
* What is the residual risk?
* Can the system recover?
* Who accepts the remaining risk?

The review should remain concise and decision-oriented.

---

## Release Risk Register Example

A conceptual record may look like:

```text
Risk ID: REL-RISK-001
Category: MIGRATION
Likelihood: POSSIBLE
Impact: SEVERE
Risk Level: HIGH

Description:
Database migration may make the previous application version incompatible.

Mitigation:
Use backward-compatible schema expansion and delay destructive migration.

Residual Risk:
MEDIUM

Owner:
Release Owner

Status:
MITIGATED
```

The exact implementation may be machine-readable.

---

## Risk Status

Risk records should use explicit states.

Recommended states include:

```text
IDENTIFIED
MITIGATING
MITIGATED
ACCEPTED
ESCALATED
CLOSED
```

A risk should never disappear merely because it is inconvenient to track.

---

## Risk and Compliance

Risk management and compliance are related but different.

Compliance asks:

> Are required controls satisfied?

Risk management asks:

> Is the remaining exposure acceptable?

A compliant release may still carry operational risk.

A risk-based exception may also produce a compliant-with-exceptions release.

Both models must remain explicit.

---

## Risk and Release Metrics

Release metrics provide historical evidence for risk management.

Examples include:

* change failure rate;
* rollback rate;
* recovery time;
* gate failure rates;
* defect escape rate.

Risk classification should improve as empirical evidence accumulates.

---

## Risk and Observability

Release observability supports real-time risk evaluation.

Observability provides evidence about:

* emerging failure;
* blast radius;
* health degradation;
* recovery effectiveness.

Insufficient observability increases uncertainty and therefore increases release risk.

---

## Risk and Quality

The Quality Framework helps identify and reduce quality-related release risks.

Release risk management consumes:

* quality findings;
* quality gate results;
* defect data;
* reliability evidence.

Quality debt may increase release risk even when a specific release contains few changes.

---

## Risk and Testing

Testing reduces uncertainty about release behavior.

The Testing Framework provides evidence used to assess:

* functional risk;
* compatibility risk;
* migration risk;
* performance risk;
* recovery risk.

Missing required tests should increase residual risk.

---

## Risk and Build

The Build Framework reduces risks related to:

* reproducibility;
* dependency state;
* artifact identity;
* artifact integrity.

Untrusted or non-reproducible artifacts significantly increase release risk.

---

## Governance

Release risk management is governed by the FamilyOS Release Framework.

Governance must ensure that:

* risk classification is consistent;
* significant risks are documented;
* owners are assigned;
* high risks receive appropriate review;
* residual risks are accepted explicitly;
* unacceptable risks block release;
* risk decisions remain traceable.

Risk governance must remain proportional to release complexity.

---

## Continuous Improvement

Release risk management must evolve based on actual outcomes.

Inputs include:

* failed releases;
* rollback events;
* incidents;
* security findings;
* compliance exceptions;
* inaccurate risk classifications;
* missed failure modes.

Improvement may include:

* better risk criteria;
* stronger automated evidence;
* improved migration patterns;
* better observability;
* improved rollback readiness;
* more effective progressive delivery.

---

## Anti-Patterns

The following practices are prohibited or strongly discouraged.

### No Explicit Risk Assessment

Assuming that passing tests means a release has no meaningful risk.

### Risk by Change Size Only

Treating small code changes as automatically low risk.

### Generic Risk Statements

Using statements such as:

```text
Something may go wrong.
```

without describing cause and impact.

### Risk Without Owner

Recording a risk without anyone responsible for managing it.

### Risk Without Mitigation

Documenting high risk but taking no action.

### Silent Risk Acceptance

Proceeding despite known significant risk without explicit approval.

### Zero-Risk Requirement

Blocking all change unless every uncertainty is eliminated.

Software releases always contain some residual risk.

### Numerical Score Worship

Allowing a calculated score to replace engineering judgment.

### Outdated Risk Registers

Keeping risks that no longer correspond to the actual release state.

### Hiding Unknowns

Treating uncertain or missing information as low risk.

---

## Required Outcomes

Implementation of this framework section must ensure that:

* every significant release receives a risk classification;
* material release risks are identified;
* likelihood and impact are evaluated;
* risk categories are consistent;
* significant risks have owners;
* mitigations are defined and verifiable;
* residual risk is explicitly evaluated;
* high and critical risks receive appropriate authority;
* unacceptable risk can block release;
* release readiness includes risk evaluation;
* risk can be reassessed during deployment;
* post-release residual risk remains visible;
* historical release outcomes improve future risk assessment.

---

## Final Release Risk Management Principle

Release engineering cannot eliminate uncertainty.

Its responsibility is to make uncertainty visible, reduce it where practical, control its consequences, and ensure that the remaining exposure is consciously accepted.

The final principle is:

> FamilyOS must never deploy a significant production release without understanding what may fail, how serious that failure could be, what controls reduce the exposure, and who is responsible for accepting the remaining risk.

Release risk management therefore provides the decision framework that connects technical change, operational uncertainty, governance, and safe production evolution.
