## Overview

EPIC-REL-001 establishes the authoritative **FamilyOS Release Framework**.

The framework defines how validated engineering state becomes an official, governed, traceable, secure, observable, and recoverable FamilyOS release.

It establishes the canonical engineering model for:

* release principles;
* release architecture;
* release lifecycle;
* versioning;
* release types;
* channels;
* planning;
* readiness;
* release candidates;
* artifacts;
* provenance;
* release validation;
* automation;
* CI/CD integration;
* changelogs;
* release notes;
* repository tagging;
* repository state;
* publication;
* distribution;
* rollback;
* recovery;
* release security;
* release observability;
* governance;
* compliance;
* metrics;
* risk management;
* framework lifecycle;
* release closure.

The Release Framework treats a release as a governed lifecycle rather than a single publication command.

---

## Problem Statement

A software release can appear successful while still failing to provide trustworthy release state.

Examples include:

* release candidates changing after validation;
* inconsistent version selection;
* missing artifact provenance;
* release tags created from the wrong commit;
* publication beginning before approval;
* partial publication being reported as full success;
* unverified remote repository state;
* release artifacts being rebuilt during publication;
* release credentials being available to untrusted jobs;
* missing rollback or recovery paths;
* release history becoming ambiguous;
* release completion being inferred from isolated technical side effects.

Without a coherent Release Framework, FamilyOS cannot reliably answer:

* What exactly is being released?
* Which version identifies it?
* Which candidate was validated?
* Which source commit produced it?
* Which artifacts belong to it?
* Were those artifacts validated?
* Who approved publication?
* Which targets were updated?
* Was publication verified?
* What happens after partial failure?
* Can the release be reconstructed years later?

EPIC-REL-001 establishes the architecture required to answer these questions consistently.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of EPIC-REL-001 is to establish the canonical FamilyOS release engineering model.

The framework defines a controlled progression:

```text
Release Planning
        ↓
Readiness Evaluation
        ↓
Release Candidate Creation
        ↓
Artifact and Provenance Binding
        ↓
Release Validation
        ↓
Approval
        ↓
Official Release Identity
        ↓
Publication
        ↓
Publication Verification
        ↓
Distribution / Promotion
        ↓
Release Completion
```

Failure, withdrawal, rollback, and recovery may introduce governed alternative transitions.

---

---

## Scope

The Release Framework includes:

* release identity;
* release planning;
* release readiness;
* release candidates;
* candidate stability;
* version selection;
* version reservation;
* semantic versioning;
* release types;
* release channels;
* release artifacts;
* provenance;
* checksums;
* release validation;
* approval;
* release automation;
* CI/CD integration;
* changelogs;
* release notes;
* Git tagging;
* repository-state verification;
* publication;
* publication targets;
* publication verification;
* distribution;
* channel promotion;
* partial publication;
* rollback;
* recovery;
* release security;
* release observability;
* governance;
* compliance;
* metrics;
* risk;
* release history;
* framework lifecycle;
* release evidence.

---

## Non-Goals

EPIC-REL-001 does not own:

* source-code implementation architecture;
* testing methodology;
* quality policy;
* build execution;
* documentation architecture;
* runtime operations;
* deployment orchestration;
* general security architecture;
* plugin-specific compliance architecture.

These remain owned by their corresponding FamilyOS frameworks.

The Release Framework integrates with these frameworks without absorbing their primary responsibilities.

---

## Release Principles

The framework follows several foundational principles.

### Release Identity Must Be Explicit

Every official release must have an identifiable release identity.

---

### Release Candidates Must Be Stable

The object being validated must remain traceable to the object considered for approval and publication.

---

### Validation Must Precede Privileged Publication

Protected publication actions should occur only after applicable validation and governance requirements are satisfied.

---

### Publication Must Be Verifiable

Attempted publication is not equivalent to verified publication.

---

### Publication and Distribution Are Distinct

A release may be published without immediately being distributed to every consumer-facing channel.

---

### Artifact Identity Must Be Preserved

Validated artifacts should not be silently replaced by newly rebuilt artifacts during publication.

---

### Historical Release State Must Be Preserved

Official release tags and publication records should remain immutable.

---

### Partial Failure Must Remain Visible

Partial publication must not be represented as complete success.

---

### Release Authority Must Be Governed

Validation authority, approval authority, and publication authority should remain appropriately separated.

---

### Recovery Must Be Designed Before Failure

Rollback and recovery requirements belong to the release architecture, not only incident response.

---

## Canonical Release Model

The canonical model is:

```text
Engineering Change
        ↓
Build Output
        ↓
Trusted Artifact Set
        ↓
Release Planning
        ↓
Release Readiness
        ↓
Release Candidate
        ↓
Release Validation
        ↓
Release Approval
        ↓
Official Release Identity
        ↓
Publication
        ↓
Publication Verification
        ↓
Distribution / Promotion
        ↓
Completed Release
```

---

## Release Lifecycle

The framework defines explicit lifecycle states.

A conceptual model may include:

```text
PLANNED
    ↓
PREPARING
    ↓
READY
    ↓
CANDIDATE
    ↓
VALIDATED
    ↓
APPROVED
    ↓
TAGGED
    ↓
PUBLISHED
    ↓
VERIFIED
    ↓
COMPLETED
```

Alternative transitions may include:

```text
BLOCKED
FAILED
WITHDRAWN
ROLLED_BACK
RECOVERING
```

The precise executable state model may evolve while preserving these responsibilities.

---

## Versioning

The framework defines predictable release identity through governed versioning.

Versioning requirements include:

* uniqueness;
* stability after publication;
* compatibility semantics;
* collision detection;
* pre-release identity where applicable;
* release-type compatibility;
* channel compatibility;
* historical traceability.

For EPIC-REL-001 itself, the historically published framework version is:

```text
4.8.0
```

---

## Release Types

Release types may include:

```text
framework
platform
plugin
documentation
security
maintenance
emergency
```

Different types may require different:

* validation profiles;
* approvals;
* publication targets;
* channels;
* rollback expectations;
* communication requirements.

---

## Release Channels

Channels may represent stability or exposure levels.

Examples may include:

```text
development
preview
candidate
stable
```

Channel semantics should remain explicit and governed.

---

## Release Planning

Release Planning establishes:

* scope;
* intended version;
* intended release type;
* intended channel;
* candidate strategy;
* publication targets;
* validation expectations;
* approvals;
* dependencies;
* risk;
* rollback expectations;
* communication requirements.

Planning does not itself make a release ready.

---

## Release Readiness

Readiness determines whether the release has satisfied the applicable preconditions required to progress.

Readiness may evaluate:

* scope completeness;
* build state;
* testing evidence;
* quality evidence;
* security evidence;
* documentation readiness;
* version readiness;
* candidate readiness;
* artifact readiness;
* governance readiness;
* publication readiness.

Readiness is distinct from publication.

---

## Release Candidates

A Release Candidate is a sufficiently stable release identity suitable for qualification.

The candidate should bind relevant release state including:

* source commit;
* version;
* artifacts;
* checksums;
* provenance;
* configuration;
* dependency state;
* validation scope;
* release notes;
* applicable release profile.

The validated candidate must remain traceable through publication.

---

## Artifacts

Release artifacts are the objects intended to represent or accompany the release.

Examples may include:

* packages;
* archives;
* plugin bundles;
* executables;
* metadata;
* manifests;
* documentation bundles;
* signatures;
* checksums.

Artifact identity and integrity must remain traceable.

---

## Provenance

Release provenance explains where the release and its artifacts came from.

It may include:

* source revision;
* Build ID;
* build evidence;
* artifact checksums;
* release candidate identity;
* release version;
* publication target;
* publication result;
* timestamps;
* responsible automation identity.

---

## Release Validation

Release Validation evaluates the exact candidate intended for approval and publication.

Validation may consume evidence from:

* Build Framework;
* Testing Framework;
* Quality Framework;
* Security Framework;
* Documentation Framework;
* Plugin Compliance Framework.

Release Validation does not replace these frameworks.

It consumes their evidence within a release decision.

---

## Release Approval

Approval is a governed decision authorizing progression beyond validation.

Approval may consider:

* technical validity;
* residual risk;
* compliance;
* publication authority;
* release timing;
* business or operational constraints.

Approval and validation SHOULD remain distinguishable.

---

## Official Release Identity

An official release identity may include:

```text
version
tag
candidate identity
artifact identity
release commit
release metadata
```

For Git-based framework publication, a release tag provides an important official repository identity.

---

## Tagging

Official Git release tags should:

* identify the intended release commit;
* use governed naming;
* be validated before creation;
* avoid collisions;
* be immutable after publication;
* be verified on the authoritative remote.

For EPIC-REL-001:

```text
v4.8.0-release-framework
```

is the historical official publication tag.

---

## Publication

Publication transitions an approved release into authoritative external release state.

Publication may include:

* Git tag publication;
* package registry publication;
* artifact publication;
* plugin registry publication;
* documentation publication;
* release-note publication;
* metadata publication.

Publication may involve multiple targets.

---

## Publication Verification

Publication is not complete merely because a command reports success.

Verification should confirm authoritative target state.

For Git publication, verification may include:

```text
local tag target
        =
remote dereferenced tag target
```

---

## Partial Publication

If some mandatory publication targets succeed and others fail, the release is in a partial publication state.

Partial publication SHALL remain visible.

Recovery should begin from the actual observed publication state.

---

## Distribution

Distribution determines how published release material reaches consumers.

Distribution may include:

* stable channel exposure;
* mirrors;
* update channels;
* package indexes;
* deployment systems;
* documentation portals.

Distribution is not identical to publication.

---

## Rollback

Rollback transitions consumers or operational state away from a defective release where applicable.

Rollback does not necessarily erase historical publication.

Published history should remain auditable.

---

## Recovery

Recovery handles failed or partial release execution.

Recovery may include:

* retry;
* resume;
* corrective publication;
* withdrawal;
* rollback;
* restoration;
* metadata repair.

Recovery SHOULD preserve evidence of what actually happened.

---

## Release Security

Release security applies to:

* release credentials;
* publication credentials;
* artifact integrity;
* provenance;
* repository protection;
* signing;
* release authorization;
* trusted execution environments;
* secret handling;
* publication targets.

Privileged publication authority should remain strongly protected.

---

## Release Observability

Release state should be observable.

Relevant signals may include:

* lifecycle state;
* candidate identity;
* validation state;
* approval state;
* tagging state;
* publication state;
* publication failures;
* partial publication;
* rollback;
* recovery;
* final completion.

---

## Release Governance

Release Governance defines:

* ownership;
* authority;
* approval;
* publication authority;
* exception handling;
* escalation;
* risk acceptance;
* emergency release authority;
* withdrawal authority;
* framework change governance.

Automation SHALL execute governed release policy rather than inventing policy.

---

## Release Compliance

Release compliance evaluates whether required controls and evidence have been satisfied.

Compliance may include:

* required reviews;
* required validation;
* required approval;
* artifact requirements;
* security requirements;
* publication requirements;
* evidence-retention requirements.

---

## Release Metrics

Release metrics may measure:

* release frequency;
* lead time;
* validation duration;
* publication duration;
* failure rate;
* rollback rate;
* recovery time;
* partial publication rate;
* release readiness trends.

Metrics should support improvement rather than replace engineering judgment.

---

## Release Risk

Release risk management identifies and governs risks such as:

* incorrect version;
* wrong candidate;
* wrong commit;
* stale artifacts;
* incomplete validation;
* publication collision;
* unauthorized publication;
* partial publication;
* unavailable publication targets;
* rollback failure;
* missing provenance.

Risk acceptance should remain explicit.

---

## Release Automation

Automation may progressively implement:

* release preflight;
* version validation;
* candidate creation;
* artifact verification;
* checksum generation;
* release-note generation;
* repository-state validation;
* tag creation;
* publication;
* verification;
* evidence capture.

Automation must preserve governance and candidate identity.

---

## CI/CD Integration

CI/CD may execute release workflow stages.

The architecture should distinguish:

```text
validation jobs
```

from:

```text
privileged publication jobs
```

Untrusted pull-request workflows should not normally receive stable publication credentials.

---

## Build / Release Boundary

The Build Framework primarily owns:

* build inputs;
* build environment;
* build execution;
* dependency resolution;
* build reproducibility;
* artifact creation;
* build validation;
* Build Evidence.

The Release Framework primarily owns:

* release readiness;
* release candidate identity;
* release version;
* approval;
* tagging;
* publication;
* distribution;
* rollback;
* recovery;
* release evidence.

The boundary is:

```text
Build Framework
        ↓
Trusted Artifact Set
        ↓
Release Framework
        ↓
Official Release
```

---

## Testing / Release Boundary

The Testing Framework owns testing architecture and execution semantics.

Release consumes testing evidence.

A release may require successful testing without redefining the tests themselves.

---

## Quality / Release Boundary

The Quality Framework owns quality rules, quality evidence, assessments, metrics, gates, and quality governance.

Release consumes applicable quality evidence when making release decisions.

---

## Security / Release Boundary

The Security Framework owns general security architecture.

Release owns release-specific security application including publication credentials, artifact integrity, authorization, and release supply-chain protections.

---

## Operations / Release Boundary

Release publication and runtime deployment are distinct.

The Release Framework may hand approved release state to operational deployment systems.

The Operations Framework owns runtime operations and service management.

---

## Canonical Documentation

EPIC-REL-001 contains exactly **32 numbered documents**:

```text
00-EPIC.md
01-Context.md
02-Vision.md
03-Release-Principles.md
04-Release-Architecture.md
05-Release-Lifecycle.md

26-Roadmap.md
27-References.md
28-Validation.md
29-Summary.md
30-Release.md
31-Implementation-Checklist.md
```

The seven control documents are:

```text
EPIC-REL-001.md
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

Canonical total:

```text
32 numbered documents
+
7 control documents
=
39 canonical files
```

---

## Canonical Structure

The machine-readable structure is:

```yaml
structure:
  numbered_documents: 32
  canonical_document_range: "00-31"
  control_documents: 7
  canonical_files: 39
```

`EPIC.yaml`, `MANIFEST.md`, and the physical repository SHALL remain synchronized.

---

## Framework Relationships

EPIC-REL-001 depends on foundational engineering frameworks including:

* `EPIC-ENG-001` — Engineering Foundation;
* `EPIC-DOC-001` — Documentation Foundation;
* `EPIC-TST-001` — Testing Framework;
* `EPIC-QLT-001` — Quality Framework;
* `EPIC-BLD-001` — Build Framework.

It integrates with:

* `EPIC-SEC-001` — Security Framework;
* `EPIC-OPS-001` — Operations Framework;
* `EPIC-PLUGIN-002` — Plugin Compliance Framework.

---

## Historical Publication

EPIC-REL-001 version `4.8.0` was historically completed and published under:

```text
v4.8.0-release-framework
```

Historical publication commit:

```text
306338d7ca3df2c1d4d9b74247a837aa01deb637
```

The historical tag is immutable.

It SHALL NOT be moved to a later post-release correction commit.

---

## Historical Tag Object

The annotated Git tag object observed during the audit is:

```text
6173105841167426c17ec08486980abb56e7085b
```

The tag dereferences to:

```text
306338d7ca3df2c1d4d9b74247a837aa01deb637
```

The dereferenced commit is the authoritative historical publication commit.

---

## Historical Tag Policy

Post-release corrections SHALL NOT:

* move the historical tag;
* recreate the historical tag;
* force-update the historical tag;
* change its target;
* rewrite its historical commit;
* claim a later correction commit as the original release.

Corrections belong to later forward Git history.

---

## Post-Release Revalidation

The current activity is a post-release revalidation of the canonical documentation state.

Its purpose is to:

* normalize `EPIC.yaml`;
* synchronize the canonical manifest;
* correct stale active lifecycle state;
* preserve historical publication;
* validate the physical repository inventory;
* validate references;
* review semantic consistency;
* execute current repository quality gates;
* re-confirm historical tag integrity;
* create a post-release correction commit;
* verify the remote branch;
* verify the historical remote tag remains unchanged.

---

## Revalidation Evidence Policy

Only actual evidence may convert a current validation requirement from pending to passed.

Commands such as:

```text
ruff check .
mypy src
pytest -q
git diff --check
```

must be executed against the repository state being validated.

Historical execution does not automatically prove the current state.

---

## Current Canonical State

```text

Historical Tag Policy:  Immutable

Current Activity:       Post-Release Revalidation
Repository Validation: Validated
Final Revalidation:     Validated
```

---

## Current Validation Requirements

The current revalidation must still produce current evidence for:

* YAML parsing;
* YAML contract;
* filesystem contract;
* numbering integrity;
* control document integrity;
* empty-file validation;
* reference integrity;
* state consistency;
* release architecture consistency;
* release lifecycle consistency;

* artifact/provenance consistency;
* publication semantics;
* rollback/recovery consistency;
* security consistency;
* observability consistency;
* governance consistency;
* framework boundaries;
* placeholder validation;
* join-defect validation;
* Ruff;
* MyPy;
* Pytest;
* repository diff validation;
* historical tag integrity recheck.

The authoritative evidence record is:

```text
VALIDATION.md
```

---

## Completion Criteria

EPIC-REL-001 is structurally complete when:

* exactly 32 numbered documents exist;
* numbering is continuous from `00` through `31`;
* all seven control documents exist;
* all 39 canonical files exist;
* no required canonical document is empty;
* `EPIC.yaml` and `MANIFEST.md` agree with the filesystem.

Current repository revalidation is complete when:

* YAML parsing passes;
* canonical inventory validation passes;
* references pass;
* active state consistency passes;
* release architecture review passes;
* release lifecycle review passes;
* versioning review passes;
* readiness semantics pass;
* release candidate semantics pass;
* artifact/provenance semantics pass;
* publication semantics pass;
* recovery semantics pass;
* security semantics pass;
* observability semantics pass;
* governance review passes;
* framework boundaries pass;
* repository quality gates pass;
* historical tag integrity is confirmed;
* current evidence is recorded.

---

## Risks

### Candidate Mutation

A candidate may change after validation.

Mitigation:

Bind validation and publication to explicit candidate identity.

---

### Version Collision

An intended version or tag may already exist.

Mitigation:

Check authoritative repository and publication state before final release identity creation.

---

### Artifact Substitution

Artifacts may be rebuilt during publication.

Mitigation:

Prefer promotion of exact validated artifact bytes.

---

### Partial Publication

Some targets may succeed while others fail.

Mitigation:

Track per-target publication state and support recovery.

---

### Unverified Publication

A successful command may be mistaken for successful publication.

Mitigation:

Verify authoritative publication targets.

---

### Excessive Publication Authority

Ordinary CI jobs may accidentally receive stable publication credentials.

Mitigation:

Separate validation and publication privileges.

---

### Historical Tag Mutation

Official historical tags may be moved after publication.

Mitigation:

Treat published release tags as immutable.

---

### Incomplete Recovery

Release systems may lack adequate recovery after partial failure.

Mitigation:

Design rollback and recovery into the framework lifecycle.

---

## Success Criteria

The Release Framework succeeds when FamilyOS can consistently answer:

```text
What is being released?

Which version identifies it?

Which candidate was validated?

Which artifacts belong to it?

Where did those artifacts come from?

Which validations passed?

Who approved the release?

Which release identity became official?

Which publication targets were updated?

Was publication verified?

Was publication partial?

How can the release be rolled back or recovered?

Can the release state be reconstructed years later?
```

---

## Release State

EPIC-REL-001 version `4.8.0` is already historically:

```text
Completed
Published
```

Historical publication:

```text
v4.8.0-release-framework
```

Historical commit:

```text
306338d7ca3df2c1d4d9b74247a837aa01deb637
```

The current documentation work is **not** preparation for the original release.

It is post-release normalization and revalidation.

---

## Final Principle

The defining Release Framework principle is:

> A release is complete only when its identity, artifacts, validation, approval, publication state, evidence, and recovery model remain coherent and verifiable across the complete release lifecycle.

---

## Final State

```text
