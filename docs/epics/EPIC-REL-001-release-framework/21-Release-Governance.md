# Release Framework

## 21 Release Governance

### Overview

EPIC-REL-001 — Release Framework defines Release Governance as the system of authority, accountability, decision rights, policy ownership, approval responsibilities, exception handling, and oversight that controls FamilyOS release engineering.

Release Governance answers questions such as:

```text
Who owns the release?

Who may declare it ready?

Who may approve the candidate?

Who may accept release risk?

Who may create an official release tag?

Who may publish artifacts?

Who may promote a stable channel?

Who may withdraw a release?

Who may authorize an emergency release?

Who may approve exceptions?

Who may change the Release Framework itself?
```

Technical capability alone does not establish governance authority.

An account, token, maintainer, automation system, or CI/CD workflow may technically be capable of performing an action while still lacking authority under FamilyOS release policy.

Release Governance therefore separates:

```text
technical permission
```

from:

```text
governed authority
```

---

## Purpose

The purpose of Release Governance is to establish:

* release ownership;
* governance roles;
* decision rights;
* approval responsibilities;
* release authority;
* publication authority;
* risk acceptance authority;
* exception authority;
* emergency authority;
* withdrawal authority;
* policy ownership;
* governance evidence;
* escalation;
* delegation;
* separation of duties;
* framework change governance.

The objective is to ensure that release decisions are deliberate, attributable, reviewable, and consistent across the FamilyOS ecosystem.

---

## Core Governance Principle

The central principle is:

> No significant release transition should depend solely on whoever happens to possess the technical capability to execute it.

The intended model is:

```text
Release Rule
    ↓
Defined Authority
    ↓
Decision
    ↓
Evidence
    ↓
Controlled Transition
```

The following model is insufficient:

```text
user has permission
    ↓
user performs release
    ↓
therefore release was authorized
```

Permission and authority must remain conceptually distinct.

---

## Governance Scope

Release Governance applies across:

```text
Planning
Readiness
Candidate Creation
Validation
Approval
Version Finalization
Tagging
Publishing
Distribution
Withdrawal
Rollback
Emergency Release
Exception Handling
Framework Evolution
```

Different release profiles may require different governance intensity.

Core authority semantics must remain explicit.

---

## Governance Model

The canonical governance model distinguishes several responsibilities:

```text
Release Governance
├── Release Ownership
├── Technical Ownership
├── Validation Authority
├── Approval Authority
├── Risk Authority
├── Exception Authority
├── Publication Authority
├── Distribution Authority
├── Recovery Authority
├── Security Authority
└── Framework Authority
```

One person may initially perform several roles.

The roles must still remain conceptually distinct.

---

## Release Owner

Every significant FamilyOS release SHOULD have a Release Owner.

The Release Owner coordinates the release lifecycle.

Typical responsibilities include:

* maintaining release scope;
* coordinating preparation;
* tracking readiness;
* coordinating validation;
* identifying blockers;
* ensuring required documentation exists;
* coordinating approvals;
* confirming publication status;
* ensuring release completion evidence exists.

The Release Owner does not automatically possess every release authority.

---

## Release Owner Authority

The Release Owner MAY have authority to:

* initiate planning;
* maintain release metadata;
* coordinate candidate creation;
* request validation;
* request approval.

The Release Owner MUST NOT automatically be assumed to have authority to:

* accept critical risk;
* bypass mandatory gates;
* publish stable releases;
* withdraw releases;
* modify governance policy.

Those authorities must be defined separately.

---

## Technical Owner

A Technical Owner is responsible for the engineering correctness of a release-relevant domain.

Examples include:

```text
core platform owner
plugin owner
build owner
documentation owner
security owner
```

Technical Owners may provide evidence or approval for domain-specific concerns.

---

## Domain Responsibility

A release may involve multiple domain owners.

For example:

```text
Platform Release
├── Core Owner
├── Plugin Owners
├── Documentation Owner
├── Security Owner
└── Release Owner
```

The Release Owner coordinates.

Domain owners validate their respective responsibilities.

---

## Validation Authority

Validation Authority determines whether applicable candidate checks have passed.

Validation authority may be:

* automated;
* human;
* hybrid.

Examples include:

```text
CI validation
security validator
compliance engine
documentation validator
maintainer review
```

Validation establishes qualification.

It does not itself necessarily grant publication authority.

---

## Approval Authority

Approval Authority determines whether a validated candidate may progress into official release identity.

The transition:

```text
VALIDATED
   ↓
APPROVED
```

is a governance transition.

Approval may consider:

* validation status;
* release risk;
* known issues;
* exceptions;
* timing;
* operational context;
* release profile.

---

## Approval Principle

The central approval rule is:

> Approval must apply to a specific release state.

Approval should identify:

```text
candidate
version intent
release scope
risk state
exceptions
```

A materially changed candidate invalidates applicable approval.

---

## Approval Evidence

Approval evidence should eventually record:

```text
candidate
approver
decision
timestamp
scope
exceptions
risk acceptance
```

This provides historical accountability.

---

## Automatic Approval

Some release profiles MAY support automatic approval.

For example, a low-risk documentation release may be automatically approved when:

```text
all mandatory gates pass
risk below threshold
no exception required
```

Automatic approval is still governance.

It must be explicitly defined by policy.

---

## Human Approval

Human approval SHOULD be used where release decisions require judgment.

Examples include:

* major platform release;
* breaking compatibility change;
* significant known defects;
* security-sensitive release;
* exceptional risk;
* emergency release;
* policy exception.

---

## Release Authority

Release Authority is the authority to establish official release identity.

This may include:

* final version confirmation;
* release commit approval;
* official tag creation authorization.

Release Authority should correspond to the transition:

```text
APPROVED
   ↓
RELEASED
```

---

## Tagging Authority

Official stable release tags represent durable repository state.

Tag creation authority therefore must be governed.

An actor capable of creating ordinary Git tags does not necessarily possess authority to create official FamilyOS release tags.

---

## Tag Deletion Authority

Deleting or modifying official release tags requires stronger governance than tag creation.

Published tag modification may represent a release integrity incident.

Normal correction should use a new release identity.

---

## Publication Authority

Publication Authority allows an approved release to create externally visible release state.

Examples include:

* pushing an official tag;
* publishing a package;
* publishing plugin artifacts;
* creating a repository release;
* publishing documentation;
* updating release metadata.

Publication Authority must remain separate from validation where practical.

---

## Distribution Authority

Distribution Authority controls consumer-facing promotion.

Examples include:

```text
candidate → stable
maintenance channel update
stable alias update
plugin catalog promotion
```

Distribution can have significant operational impact even when artifacts are already published.

---

## Stable Channel Authority

Stable channel mutation is a privileged governance action.

Only explicitly authorized actors or systems should be able to change the version exposed as stable.

---

## Risk Authority

Release Risk Authority determines whether residual release risk is acceptable.

Risk authority may vary by severity.

For example:

```text
LOW
→ Release Owner

MEDIUM
→ Maintainer / Release Authority

HIGH
→ designated senior authority

CRITICAL
→ normally block or exceptional authority
```

The exact thresholds are defined in Release Risk Management and governance policy.

---

## Risk Acceptance Principle

Risk acceptance must be explicit.

The following is invalid:

```text
risk known
+
release proceeded
=
risk implicitly accepted
```

The correct model is:

```text
risk identified
      ↓
risk evaluated
      ↓
acceptance authority identified
      ↓
decision recorded
```

---

## Exception Authority

Exception Authority determines whether a release may proceed despite a requirement not being satisfied.

An exception must identify:

* requirement;
* justification;
* release scope;
* risk;
* compensating controls;
* authority;
* duration where applicable.

---

## Exception Principle

An exception modifies one specific release decision.

It does not redefine the framework.

For example:

```text
Release 5.2.0
Rule X exception
```

does not mean:

```text
Rule X no longer applies to future releases
```

---

## Exception Scope

Exceptions should be scoped narrowly.

Possible scopes include:

```text
one candidate
one release
one release channel
one release profile
limited time period
```

Broad indefinite exceptions should be avoided.

---

## Exception Expiration

Temporary exceptions SHOULD include expiration where relevant.

Expired exceptions must not silently continue to authorize new releases.

---

## Compensating Controls

An approved exception may require compensating controls.

For example:

```text
full integration environment unavailable
```

may require:

```text
focused manual verification
additional post-release monitoring
restricted distribution
```

if policy permits.

---

## Non-Exceptionable Rules

Some release requirements may be declared non-exceptionable.

Potential examples include:

* conflicting official release identity;
* known compromised release credential;
* inability to identify source revision;
* artifact integrity conflict;
* unauthorized publication.

The exact set is defined by policy.

---

## Security Authority

Security Authority is responsible for release decisions involving security-sensitive conditions.

Responsibilities may include:

* security finding classification;
* security exception approval;
* coordinated disclosure;
* emergency security release approval;
* credential compromise response;
* release withdrawal recommendation.

---

## Compliance Authority

Compliance Authority determines release consequences of compliance findings where separate governance is required.

For official plugin releases, this may include:

* blocking compliance findings;
* exception review;
* profile conformance;
* evidence sufficiency.

---

## Documentation Authority

Documentation Authority may validate:

* release notes;
* changelog;
* migration guidance;
* framework completeness;
* release documentation quality.

Documentation Authority does not automatically grant release publication authority.

---

## Emergency Authority

Emergency releases require explicit emergency authority.

Emergency authority may authorize:

* accelerated planning;
* compressed approval sequence;
* limited procedural variation;
* focused validation.

Emergency authority MUST NOT automatically waive core release invariants.

---

## Emergency Governance Principle

The governing rule is:

> Emergency authority accelerates decisions; it does not eliminate accountability.

Emergency release evidence should identify:

```text
emergency reason
authority
candidate
validation performed
risk accepted
publication result
```

---

## Break-Glass Governance

Future FamilyOS governance MAY define break-glass authority for severe emergencies.

Break-glass usage must be:

* explicit;
* limited;
* auditable;
* temporary;
* reviewed afterward.

It must not become a normal release path.

---

## Withdrawal Authority

Withdrawal removes a published release from normal consumption.

Because withdrawal can affect consumers and support state, it must require explicit authority.

Withdrawal reasons may include:

* critical defect;
* security compromise;
* invalid artifact;
* release integrity failure;
* governance error.

---

## Withdrawal Decision

A withdrawal decision should record:

```text
release
reason
authority
replacement guidance
consumer impact
timestamp
```

The release history must remain preserved.

---

## Supersession Authority

Normal release supersession may be policy-driven.

For example:

```text
5.2.1 becomes stable
      ↓
5.2.0 becomes superseded
```

This may not require manual governance if the release channel rules already define it.

---

## Rollback Authority

Rollback or channel restoration can materially affect consumers.

Rollback authority must therefore be explicit.

The authority may depend on:

* environment;
* release type;
* operational severity;
* security impact.

---

## Forward-Recovery Authority

A corrective release follows normal or emergency release governance depending on urgency.

Forward recovery must not bypass versioning or release identity requirements.

---

## Governance and Lifecycle

Governance applies to lifecycle transitions.

A conceptual authority model is:

```text
PLANNED → PREPARED
Release Owner

PREPARED → READY
Readiness Policy / Validators

READY → CANDIDATE
Release Owner / Automation

CANDIDATE → VALIDATED
Validation Authority

VALIDATED → APPROVED
Approval Authority

APPROVED → RELEASED
Release Authority

RELEASED → PUBLISHED
Publication Authority

PUBLISHED → DISTRIBUTED
Distribution Authority

COMPLETED → WITHDRAWN
Withdrawal Authority
```

Exact ownership may vary by release profile.

---

## Governance Matrix

A future governance matrix may define:

```text
Action                    Authority

Plan Release              Release Owner
Validate Readiness        Validators
Create Candidate          Release Owner / Automation
Validate Candidate        Validation Authority
Accept Risk               Risk Authority
Approve Exception         Exception Authority
Approve Stable Release    Release Authority
Create Official Tag       Tagging Authority
Publish Artifacts         Publication Authority
Promote Stable            Distribution Authority
Withdraw Release          Withdrawal Authority
Change Framework Policy   Framework Authority
```

This model should remain machine-readable where practical in the future.

---

## Separation of Duties

Separation of duties reduces concentration of release authority.

Potential separation includes:

```text
developer
≠
release approver
```

```text
candidate validator
≠
publisher
```

```text
security finder
≠
security exception approver
```

The strictness depends on release risk and team maturity.

---

## Minimum Separation

At minimum, FamilyOS should conceptually separate:

```text
qualification
authorization
execution
```

even if one maintainer performs all three roles during early project maturity.

This distinction allows stronger governance later without redesigning release semantics.

---

## Small-Team Model

In a small FamilyOS team, one authorized maintainer may act as:

* Release Owner;
* Validator;
* Approver;
* Publisher.

When this occurs, the release process should still record distinct decisions and evidence.

The absence of multiple people must not cause governance concepts to disappear.

---

## Future Team Model

As FamilyOS grows, roles may be distributed.

For example:

```text
Release Owner
        ↓
coordinates

Domain Validators
        ↓
qualify

Release Approver
        ↓
authorizes

Automation
        ↓
publishes
```

This supports scalable governance.

---

## Delegation

Governance authority MAY be delegated.

Delegation must define:

* delegated role;
* scope;
* duration;
* limits;
* delegating authority.

Informal assumption of authority should be avoided.

---

## Temporary Delegation

Temporary release authority may be useful during:

* maintainer absence;
* incident response;
* scheduled release responsibility.

Temporary authority should expire automatically or be explicitly revoked where practical.

---

## Authority Revocation

Release authority must be revocable.

Examples include:

* maintainer leaves project;
* credential compromise;
* role change;
* security incident.

Governance and technical permissions must be updated consistently.

---

## Governance Identity

Governance decisions should use identifiable actors.

Examples include:

```text
human maintainer identity
service account
release automation identity
policy engine
```

Anonymous approval is unsuitable for significant releases.

---

## Governance Evidence

Significant governance decisions should become durable release evidence.

Evidence may include:

* release owner;
* validators;
* approvals;
* exceptions;
* risk acceptance;
* emergency authorization;
* withdrawal decision.

---

## Decision Record

A future structured decision record may contain:

```text
decision:
  type: release-approval
  release: 5.2.0
  candidate: 5.2.0-rc.3
  result: approved
  authority: release-maintainer
  timestamp: ...
```

The schema is illustrative.

---

## Approval Record Integrity

Approval records must not be silently modifiable after publication.

Corrections should preserve audit history where practical.

---

## Governance Auditability

A historical release should allow maintainers to determine:

```text
Who owned the release?

Who validated it?

Who approved it?

Which risks were accepted?

Which exceptions were used?

Who published it?

Who changed stable state?
```

This is essential for accountability.

---

## Policy Authority

Release policies must have explicit ownership.

Policy Authority may control:

* mandatory gates;
* release profiles;
* approval rules;
* exception rules;
* tag policy;
* publication policy;
* recovery policy.

---

## Policy Change

Release policy changes are themselves governed engineering changes.

A policy must not change simply because automation configuration was modified.

The intended sequence is:

```text
policy change proposed
      ↓
review
      ↓
approval
      ↓
documentation update
      ↓
implementation update
```

---

## Framework Authority

The Release Framework itself requires governance.

Framework Authority determines who may change normative EPIC-REL-001 rules.

Changes may require:

* documentation review;
* architectural review;
* compatibility analysis;
* migration plan;
* framework version increment.

---

## Framework Self-Governance

EPIC-REL-001 must eventually apply its own release discipline to its evolution.

A future framework revision should progress through:

```text
proposal
   ↓
documentation update
   ↓
validation
   ↓
approval
   ↓
version
   ↓
release
```

---

## Governance Hierarchy

FamilyOS governance may include several layers.

Conceptually:

```text
Engineering Constitution
        ↓
Architecture Decisions
        ↓
Frameworks
        ↓
Release Policies
        ↓
Release Profiles
        ↓
Release Execution
```

Lower-level governance must not silently contradict higher-level normative authority.

---

## Normative Precedence

If release policy conflicts with an authoritative FamilyOS foundation, the conflict must be resolved explicitly.

Automation must not choose which rule to ignore.

---

## ADR Relationship

Significant changes to release architecture or governance may require Architecture Decision Records.

Examples include:

* adopting mandatory signed releases;
* changing platform version strategy;
* introducing multi-repository release orchestration;
* changing official release authority model.

---

## RFC Relationship

Major release capability changes may require RFCs where broader engineering review is appropriate.

The Release Framework should integrate with existing FamilyOS architectural decision processes.

---

## Governance and Compliance

Release Compliance determines whether a release followed applicable rules.

Governance determines what happens when it did not.

Possible outcomes include:

```text
BLOCK
REMEDIATE
EXCEPTION
ACCEPT RISK
```

depending on the rule and authority.

---

## Governance and Risk

Risk Management identifies and evaluates release risk.

Governance assigns authority to accept or reject that risk.

A risk report without decision authority does not complete release governance.

---

## Governance and Security

Security-sensitive governance may require stricter authority.

Examples include:

* accepting a high-severity vulnerability;
* rotating signing authority;
* responding to credential compromise;
* publishing security advisories;
* withdrawing compromised releases.

---

## Governance and Automation

Automation may enforce governance gates.

Examples include:

```text
approval == granted
```

before:

```text
publish
```

or:

```text
exception == approved
```

before allowing a failed policy to proceed.

Automation must not invent authority.

---

## Governance and CI/CD

CI/CD protected environments, required reviewers, or protected jobs may implement release governance.

Provider-specific controls are implementation mechanisms.

The governance rule must remain documented independently.

---

## Governance and Repository Permissions

Repository permissions should align with governed authority.

For example:

```text
official tag permission
```

should ideally be restricted to identities with Release Authority.

Technical permission should reinforce governance.

---

## Governance Drift

Governance Drift occurs when technical permissions no longer match documented authority.

Examples include:

* former maintainer retains release token;
* CI job gains stable publication rights accidentally;
* unreviewed user gains tag deletion permission.

Governance drift should be periodically reviewed.

---

## Access Review

FamilyOS SHOULD periodically review privileged release access as project maturity increases.

Review may include:

```text
repository admins
tag creators
registry publishers
secret access
CI/CD privileged identities
```

---

## Governance for Release Profiles

Each release profile should define its governance requirements.

For example:

```text
framework-release
├── Release Owner
├── Documentation Validation
├── Release Approval
└── Tag Publication Authority
```

while:

```text
platform-major-release
├── Release Owner
├── Technical Validation
├── Security Validation
├── Risk Approval
├── Release Approval
├── Publication Authority
└── Distribution Authority
```

---

## Documentation Release Governance

A low-risk documentation correction may require lightweight governance.

Possible model:

```text
documentation validation
      ↓
maintainer approval
      ↓
publication
```

The framework permits proportional governance.

---

## Framework Release Governance

A framework release should normally require:

* framework owner or maintainer;
* documentation validation;
* release approval;
* official tagging authority;
* final repository verification.

---

## Plugin Release Governance

An official plugin release may require:

* plugin owner;
* plugin validation;
* compliance validation;
* platform compatibility;
* release approval;
* publication authority.

---

## Platform Release Governance

Platform releases require stronger coordination.

Possible authorities include:

* platform Release Owner;
* component owners;
* security authority;
* release approver;
* distribution authority.

---

## Major Release Governance

Major releases SHOULD receive stronger governance because they may introduce compatibility breaks.

Governance may require:

* architectural review;
* migration review;
* stronger risk acceptance;
* explicit release approval.

---

## Security Release Governance

Security releases may require:

* restricted participants;
* security authority;
* coordinated disclosure authority;
* release authority;
* publication timing control.

---

## Emergency Release Governance

Emergency releases may use an accelerated decision structure.

For example:

```text
Emergency Owner
      ↓
Focused Validation
      ↓
Emergency Authority
      ↓
Publication
      ↓
Post-Release Review
```

---

## Post-Emergency Review

Emergency release governance SHOULD include a post-release review.

The review may examine:

* why emergency path was needed;
* which controls were compressed;
* whether risk assumptions were correct;
* whether follow-up remediation is required.

---

## Governance Escalation

When a release decision exceeds an actor's authority, the issue must be escalated.

Examples include:

* high risk;
* security exception;
* breaking change;
* major governance conflict;
* release integrity uncertainty.

The release should remain blocked until appropriate authority decides.

---

## Escalation Path

A future model may define:

```text
Release Owner
      ↓
Framework / Domain Authority
      ↓
Platform Governance
```

The exact hierarchy may evolve.

---

## Governance Deadlock

A release may become blocked when required authority is unavailable or disagreement cannot be resolved.

This is a valid blocked release state.

The release must not bypass governance merely to maintain schedule.

---

## Governance Conflict

If two authorities disagree, the applicable governance hierarchy must determine resolution.

Automation should not pick whichever result allows publication.

---

## Release Schedule Pressure

Deadlines do not automatically override release governance.

Schedule pressure may trigger:

* scope reduction;
* release postponement;
* emergency classification if truly justified.

It must not silently weaken mandatory controls.

---

## Governance for Known Issues

Known non-blocking issues may require acceptance.

The release record should identify:

* issue;
* impact;
* owner;
* accepting authority;
* release note treatment.

---

## Governance for Breaking Changes

Breaking changes may require explicit acknowledgment.

Approval should verify:

* version increment appropriate;
* migration guidance exists;
* compatibility implications understood.

---

## Governance for Deprecation

Deprecation may require policy-defined communication and future removal planning.

Approval should ensure that consumers receive sufficient transition guidance.

---

## Governance for Withdrawal

Release withdrawal requires:

```text
release identity
reason
authority
consumer guidance
replacement strategy
```

Withdrawal must remain historically visible.

---

## Governance for Tag Repair

Repair of published release tags is an exceptional governance action.

It may require:

* incident declaration;
* release authority;
* security review;
* consumer impact analysis.

Normal release processes must not support casual tag repair.

---

## Governance for Artifact Replacement

Replacing a published immutable artifact under the same version is normally prohibited.

If a publication system technically permits it, governance must still block it except under extraordinary incident response conditions.

A new version is the normal correction mechanism.

---

## Governance for Framework Exceptions

A release exception applies to release execution.

A framework exception changes normative framework behavior and therefore requires a formal framework change.

These concepts must not be confused.

---

## Governance Record Retention

Governance evidence should remain available for significant official releases for as long as required by platform policy.

This supports:

* audit;
* security investigation;
* incident analysis;
* historical reconstruction.

---

## Governance Privacy

Governance evidence may contain identities and internal decisions.

Not all governance evidence needs to be public.

The system may distinguish:

```text
public release metadata
```

from:

```text
internal governance evidence
```

---

## Governance Transparency

Even when internal details remain restricted, public releases should expose enough information to establish:

* official status;
* version;
* release authority outcome;
* withdrawal status where applicable.

---

## Governance Metrics

FamilyOS may eventually track:

* approval lead time;
* exception frequency;
* emergency release frequency;
* blocked release count;
* risk acceptance frequency;
* governance policy violations;
* access review findings.

Metrics should improve governance effectiveness rather than encourage rubber-stamp approvals.

---

## Approval Quality

A low approval time is not inherently better.

Governance metrics must not reward superficial or rushed decisions.

---

## Exception Metrics

Frequent exceptions may indicate:

* unrealistic policy;
* implementation maturity gap;
* poor planning;
* repeated process bypass.

Recurring exceptions should trigger framework review.

---

## Governance Review

Release Governance itself should be periodically reviewed.

Review should ask:

```text
Are authorities still correct?

Do technical permissions match governance?

Are release profiles appropriate?

Are exceptions too frequent?

Are emergency paths being misused?

Are controls proportionate to risk?
```

---

## Governance Maturity Model

FamilyOS Release Governance may evolve through:

```text
Level 1
maintainer-owned manual release

Level 2
documented release roles

Level 3
explicit approval and exception records

Level 4
protected technical permissions

Level 5
profile-specific governance

Level 6
structured governance evidence

Level 7
risk-based approval authority

Level 8
policy-driven authorization

Level 9
auditable multi-role release governance

Level 10
fully integrated platform governance
```

---

## Current FamilyOS Governance Context

Current FamilyOS framework releases already contain several governance behaviors.

These include:

```text
framework completion decision
repository validation
version selection
annotated tag creation
authoritative remote publication
final state verification
```

EPIC-REL-001 formalizes the authority and evidence behind these actions.

---

## Current Framework Release Governance

For a current framework release, the practical governance model may initially be:

```text
Release Owner
maintainer responsible for framework completion

Validation Authority
framework/documentation validation

Release Authority
authorized repository maintainer

Publication Authority
authorized Git remote maintainer
```

These responsibilities may currently be held by one person.

The conceptual separation remains important.

---

## EPIC-REL-001 Self-Governance

Before EPIC-REL-001 itself is released, governance should confirm:

```text
framework scope complete
validation complete
implementation checklist complete
control documents aligned
release version approved
release commit approved
tag approved
publication authorized
```

This makes the Release Framework subject to its own governance principles.

---

## Governance Decision Model

Every significant governed decision should have:

```text
subject
authority
decision
evidence
scope
time
```

This creates a simple, reusable governance model.

---

## Governance Result Model

Governance decisions should use explicit outcomes.

Examples include:

```text
APPROVED
REJECTED
BLOCKED
EXCEPTION_GRANTED
EXCEPTION_DENIED
RISK_ACCEPTED
WITHDRAWAL_APPROVED
```

Ambiguous outcomes should be avoided.

---

## Release Approval Example

Conceptually:

```text
Release Approval

Candidate          5.2.0-rc.3
Target Version     5.2.0
Validation         PASS
Risk               ACCEPTABLE
Exceptions         0

Decision           APPROVED
```

---

## Exception Example

```text
Release Exception

Candidate          5.2.0-rc.3
Requirement        optional compatibility environment
Reason             infrastructure unavailable
Risk               LOW
Compensation       post-release verification

Decision           EXCEPTION_GRANTED
```

---

## Withdrawal Example

```text
Release Governance

Release            5.2.0
Reason             critical integrity defect
Replacement        5.2.1

Decision           WITHDRAWAL_APPROVED
```

---

## Governance Automation Vision

A future policy engine may evaluate whether a transition is authorized.

Conceptually:

```text
candidate.validation == pass
release.approval == granted
actor.permission == publish
release.risk <= actor.max_risk
```

Only then:

```text
publication authorized
```

This must remain explainable and auditable.

## Governance Policy-as-Code

Some governance rules MAY become machine-evaluable.

Examples include:

```text
stable release requires approval
security release requires security authority
critical risk cannot be accepted by ordinary release owner
```

Machine-readable policy must reflect human-readable normative rules.

---

## Human Override

Where policy permits override, override must itself be a governed action.

A hidden administrative bypass is not an acceptable governance model.

---

## Governance Integrity

Governance decisions are part of release integrity.

An official release whose approval state cannot be reconstructed has weaker historical trust.

---

## Governance Invariants

The following invariants apply.

### RG1 — Significant release responsibilities have explicit ownership.

### RG2 — Technical permission does not automatically imply release authority.

### RG3 — Release approval applies to a specific candidate and release scope.

### RG4 — Material candidate change invalidates affected approval.

### RG5 — Risk acceptance requires appropriate authority.

### RG6 — Exceptions are explicit, scoped, and recorded.

### RG7 — Emergency releases retain explicit authority and accountability.

### RG8 — Stable publication and distribution require governed authority.

### RG9 — Withdrawal and release history modification require explicit governance.

### RG10 — Framework policy changes are governed changes.

### RG11 — Governance evidence remains sufficiently auditable.

### RG12 — Automation enforces governance but does not invent authority.

---

## Governance Anti-Patterns

### Permission Equals Authority

Assuming a user may release simply because repository permissions allow it.

---

### Approval by Silence

Treating absence of objection as formal release approval.

---

### Detached Approval

Using approval from one candidate for another materially changed candidate.

---

### Unlimited Exception

Granting an exception without scope or expiration.

---

### Emergency Forever

Using emergency release procedures routinely because they are faster.

---

### Shared Anonymous Publisher

Using an untraceable shared account for official publication.

---

### Pipeline Self-Approval

Allowing a publication pipeline to define and approve its own release policy without external governance.

---

### Risk by Default

Assuming all remaining release risk is accepted because no one explicitly blocked publication.

---

### Policy Hidden in Permissions

Using repository or registry permissions as the only definition of governance roles.

---

### Historical Rewrite Without Authority

Moving official tags, replacing artifacts, or changing release status without governed decision.

---

## Minimum Governance Model

At minimum, every significant official FamilyOS release should identify:

```text
release owner
validation result
release approval authority
publication authority
risk state
exceptions
```

where those concepts apply.

---

## Minimum Framework Release Governance

For current FamilyOS framework releases, the minimum model should verify:

```text
framework completion authorized
validation complete
version decision explicit
release commit explicit
annotated tag creation authorized
remote publication authorized
final state verified
```

---

## Target Governance Experience

At higher maturity, FamilyOS tooling should provide a governance view such as:

```text
FamilyOS Release Governance

Release              6.0.0
Candidate            6.0.0-rc.2
Profile              platform-major

Release Owner        ASSIGNED
Validation           PASS
Security Approval    GRANTED
Risk                 ACCEPTED
Exceptions           0
Release Approval     GRANTED
Publication Authority VERIFIED
Distribution Authority VERIFIED

GOVERNANCE STATUS    APPROVED
```

---

## Target Historical Experience

Years after a release, maintainers should be able to determine:

```text
who owned it
who validated it
who approved it
what risk was accepted
which exceptions existed
who published it
whether it was later withdrawn
```

This establishes release accountability as durable engineering evidence.

## Relationship With Release Principles

`03-Release-Principles.md` establishes that release authority, approval, exceptions, and risk decisions must be explicit.

This document defines the governance model implementing those principles.

---

## Relationship With Release Architecture

`04-Release-Architecture.md` defines where approval, authority, and exception responsibilities exist.

This document assigns governance semantics to those responsibilities.

---

## Relationship With Release Lifecycle

`05-Release-Lifecycle.md` defines transitions requiring governance.

This document defines which authorities control those transitions.

---

## Relationship With Release Planning

`08-Release-Planning.md` identifies ownership and expected approval requirements before qualification begins.

---

## Relationship With Release Readiness

`09-Release-Readiness.md` consumes governance readiness, including known release ownership and required authority.

---

## Relationship With Release Validation

`12-Release-Validation.md` produces the technical qualification evidence used by governance.

Validation does not replace governance approval.

---

## Relationship With Release Automation

`13-Release-Automation.md` defines automation behavior.

Automation must enforce governance decisions and authority boundaries.

---

## Relationship With CI/CD Integration

`14-CI-CD-Integration.md` may implement governance through protected environments, approvals, privileged jobs, and scoped credentials.

---

## Relationship With Tagging and Repository State

`16-Tagging-and-Repository-State.md` defines release tag semantics.

This document governs who may create, publish, delete, or repair official release tags.

---

## Relationship With Publishing and Distribution

`17-Publishing-and-Distribution.md` defines release publication and channel promotion.

This document governs who may authorize those transitions.

---

## Relationship With Rollback and Recovery

`18-Rollback-and-Recovery.md` defines corrective release actions.

Governance defines who may authorize rollback, withdrawal, or forward recovery.

---

## Relationship With Release Security

`19-Release-Security.md` defines identity, authorization, and privileged release controls.

Release Governance defines the authority those security mechanisms enforce.

---

## Relationship With Release Observability

`20-Release-Observability.md` defines how governance decisions, actors, state transitions, and exceptions become observable and auditable.

---

## Relationship With Release Compliance

`22-Release-Compliance.md` evaluates whether release activity followed applicable governance requirements.

---

## Relationship With Release Risk Management

`24-Release-Risk-Management.md` defines the detailed release risk model.

This document defines who may accept which risks.

---

## Final Statement

The FamilyOS Release Governance model establishes explicit authority and accountability across the complete release lifecycle.

It separates technical capability from governed permission, distinguishes ownership from approval, makes risk acceptance and exceptions explicit, protects privileged publication and distribution decisions, and provides clear authority for emergency response, withdrawal, recovery, and framework evolution.

A release should never be considered authorized merely because someone or something was technically able to publish it.

An official FamilyOS release must represent a deliberate engineering decision made under defined authority, supported by evidence, and preserved as part of the platform's historical record.
