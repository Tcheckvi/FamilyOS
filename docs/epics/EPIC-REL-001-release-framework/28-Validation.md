# Release Framework

## 28 Validation

### Overview

Validation defines how the FamilyOS Release Framework is verified as complete, coherent, enforceable, and ready to govern production releases.

The framework is not considered complete merely because its documents exist.

Its rules, structures, responsibilities, gates, evidence requirements, rollback expectations, observability requirements, compliance controls, metrics, and risk model must form a consistent whole.

Validation therefore evaluates both:

* the documentation framework itself;
* the release capability that the framework is intended to govern.

The governing principle is:

> The FamilyOS Release Framework is valid only when its requirements are complete, internally consistent, traceable, testable, and capable of supporting safe release decisions.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to define the validation model for EPIC-REL-001.

Validation must determine whether the Release Framework:

* covers the required release lifecycle;
* defines clear release states;
* defines release roles and authority;
* establishes readiness criteria;
* defines release gates;
* integrates build, testing, quality, security, and compliance evidence;
* defines rollback and recovery expectations;
* establishes observability requirements;
* defines release metrics;
* provides risk management controls;
* defines governance and evolution mechanisms;
* remains aligned with the FamilyOS engineering architecture.

Validation must produce explicit evidence.

---

## Validation Objectives

The Release Framework validation process must establish confidence in several dimensions.

### Structural Completeness

All required framework documents and metadata artifacts must exist.

### Content Completeness

The documents must collectively cover the required release engineering domains.

### Internal Consistency

Requirements across documents must not contradict one another.

### Traceability

Release requirements must be traceable to their governing framework concepts.

### Enforceability

Mandatory requirements must be expressible as procedures, gates, checks, or governance decisions.

### Integrability

The Release Framework must integrate correctly with adjacent FamilyOS frameworks.

### Operational Applicability

The framework must support real release workflows rather than remain purely theoretical.

---

## Validation Scope

Validation applies to the complete EPIC-REL-001 Release Framework.

This includes:

* normative documents;
* release lifecycle definitions;
* versioning rules;
* release candidate rules;
* readiness requirements;
* gate definitions;
* approval requirements;
* deployment expectations;
* rollback and recovery;
* observability;
* compliance;
* metrics;
* risk management;
* roadmap;
* supporting metadata;
* governance artifacts.

Validation should also consider relationships with external engineering foundations.

---

## Validation Levels

Release Framework validation should operate at several levels.

```text id="o1ue7c"
Structure Validation
        |
        v
Document Validation
        |
        v
Cross-Document Validation
        |
        v
Framework Integration Validation
        |
        v
Operational Validation
```

Each level verifies a different class of risk.

---

## Level 1 — Structure Validation

Structure validation confirms that the expected Release Framework artifacts exist.

Checks may include:

* required directory exists;
* required numbered documents exist;
* required metadata files exist;
* no required files are empty;
* no unexpected duplicate numbering exists;
* filenames follow conventions;
* framework inventory is complete.

A structural validation failure means the framework is incomplete regardless of document quality.

---

## Expected Document Inventory

The canonical Release Framework inventory should be explicitly defined.

Validation should verify the presence of all expected release documents.

Conceptually:

```text id="yw1kb8"
00-EPIC.md
01-Context.md
...
26-Roadmap.md
...
28-Validation.md
...
```

The exact complete inventory is governed by the EPIC manifest and repository state.

The validation process must use the canonical inventory rather than rely on memory.

---

## Empty File Validation

Required framework documents must not be empty.

A basic repository validation may verify:

```text id="wvy3q7"
required_files > 0 bytes
```

However, file size alone is not sufficient.

A non-empty placeholder document is still incomplete.

Content validation must follow.

---

## Naming Validation

Documents must follow established FamilyOS naming conventions.

Validation should check:

* numeric prefixes;
* consistent title capitalization;
* `.md` extension;
* no duplicate document numbers;
* no conflicting canonical filenames.

Naming consistency improves discoverability and automation.

---

## Level 2 — Document Validation

Each framework document must be validated independently.

Document validation should evaluate:

* title consistency;
* purpose;
* scope;
* normative clarity;
* completeness;
* relationships;
* required outcomes;
* final principle where applicable.

Documents should not contain unresolved placeholders unless explicitly permitted.

---

## Heading Validation

Important framework documents should follow a predictable heading model.

For example:

```text id="19z9g0"
# Release Framework

# <Document Number> <Document Title>
```

Validation may check heading structure automatically.

The goal is consistency across the framework.

---

## Language Validation

The canonical FamilyOS engineering documentation language must be respected.

Release Framework documents should remain consistent in language and terminology.

Mixed-language normative content should be avoided unless explicitly required.

---

## Terminology Validation

Core terms must have consistent meaning across all Release Framework documents.

Important terms include:

```text id="ozm9qa"
release
release candidate
release readiness
release gate
release evidence
release approval
deployment
rollback
recovery
release compliance
release risk
release observability
```

Terminology drift creates governance ambiguity.

---

## Normative Language Validation

Mandatory rules must be distinguishable from recommendations.

Examples of normative language include:

```text id="wof76u"
must
must not
required
shall
prohibited
```

Advisory language may include:

```text id="2yo5mf"
should
may
recommended
where practical
```

Documents should avoid ambiguous requirements when release blocking behavior depends on them.

---

## Level 3 — Cross-Document Validation

The Release Framework must be internally coherent.

Cross-document validation should verify that definitions and requirements align.

Examples include:

* release readiness aligns with release gates;
* compliance requirements align with evidence requirements;
* rollback requirements align with risk management;
* observability requirements support release verification;
* release metrics reference actual lifecycle events;
* roadmap phases build on previously defined capabilities.

Contradictions must be resolved before framework completion.

---

## Lifecycle Consistency Validation

All documents must reflect the same overall release lifecycle.

A canonical lifecycle may be represented as:

```text id="4ji05n"
Change
  |
  v
Build
  |
  v
Validation
  |
  v
Release Candidate
  |
  v
Readiness
  |
  v
Approval
  |
  v
Deployment
  |
  v
Verification
  |
  v
Stabilization
  |
  v
Acceptance
```

Documents may focus on different stages, but they must not define incompatible lifecycle models.

---

## Release State Validation

Release states must be defined consistently.

Possible states may include:

```text id="5yrxlu"
DRAFT
CANDIDATE
VALIDATING
BLOCKED
READY
APPROVED
DEPLOYING
VERIFYING
STABILIZING
RELEASED
FAILED
ROLLED_BACK
RECOVERED
```

The final state model may differ.

What matters is that the framework exposes one coherent release state system.

---

## Gate Consistency Validation

Release gate definitions must align with other framework requirements.

For example:

```text id="rhz9od"
Build Framework
      |
      v
Build Gate

Testing Framework
      |
      v
Testing Gate

Quality Framework
      |
      v
Quality Gate

Release Compliance
      |
      v
Compliance Gate

Release Readiness
      |
      v
Final Release Gate
```

No mandatory framework requirement should be unintentionally omitted from the applicable gate model.

---

## Evidence Consistency Validation

Release evidence requirements should use a coherent evidence model.

Evidence must support:

* build state;
* test state;
* quality state;
* security state;
* artifact identity;
* approvals;
* deployment state;
* runtime verification;
* rollback or recovery.

Evidence references should be authoritative and traceable.

---

## Risk and Compliance Consistency

Risk management and compliance must remain distinct but compatible.

Validation should confirm that:

* mandatory controls can block release;
* accepted residual risk remains visible;
* approved exceptions remain traceable;
* risk acceptance does not silently bypass mandatory compliance;
* compliance does not falsely imply zero operational risk.

---

## Rollback and Deployment Consistency

Deployment and rollback rules must be compatible.

Validation should determine whether the framework clearly defines:

* previous stable release;
* rollback classification;
* artifact retention;
* configuration restoration;
* migration compatibility;
* rollback verification.

A deployment strategy without a recovery strategy is incomplete.

---

## Observability and Verification Consistency

Post-deployment verification must rely on observability capabilities defined by the framework.

Validation should confirm that release verification can access:

* release identity;
* deployment markers;
* health signals;
* critical metrics;
* logs;
* alerts;
* recovery state.

Required verification must not depend on signals that the framework never requires.

---

## Metric Definition Validation

Release metrics must have clear definitions.

Validation should verify that metrics specify:

* purpose;
* boundaries;
* formula where relevant;
* authoritative data source;
* segmentation dimensions.

Ambiguous metrics should not be used as governance indicators.

---

## Level 4 — Framework Integration Validation

The Release Framework depends on other FamilyOS engineering frameworks.

Integration validation verifies those relationships.

The key model is:

```text id="ci244f"
Build Framework
Testing Framework
Quality Framework
Security Controls
Plugin Compliance Framework
Documentation Framework
        |
        v
Release Framework
        |
        v
Production Change
```

The Release Framework must consume these capabilities rather than redefine them inconsistently.

---

## Build Framework Integration Validation

Validation should confirm that the Release Framework relies on the Build Framework for:

* build reproducibility;
* artifact creation;
* artifact identity;
* artifact integrity;
* provenance.

The Release Framework should govern artifact promotion and release use, not redefine build mechanics unnecessarily.

---

## Testing Framework Integration Validation

Validation should confirm that the Release Framework consumes:

* test results;
* regression evidence;
* integration evidence;
* compatibility evidence;
* recovery testing evidence.

The Release Framework must not redefine testing architecture.

---

## Quality Framework Integration Validation

Validation should confirm alignment with:

* quality gates;
* quality evidence;
* quality risks;
* defect management;
* quality metrics.

Release quality requirements must remain compatible with the Quality Framework.

---

## Plugin Compliance Integration Validation

Plugin releases must integrate Plugin Compliance Framework outcomes.

Validation should confirm that:

```text id="vgt9p0"
plugin_compliance == eligibility_input
```

rather than:

```text id="smzgen"
plugin_compliance == production_release_authorization
```

Release authorization remains a separate concern.

---

## Documentation Framework Integration Validation

Release documentation requirements should follow FamilyOS documentation standards.

Validation should verify:

* naming conventions;
* document structure;
* release note consistency;
* changelog consistency;
* version references;
* normative language.

---

## Security Integration Validation

Release validation must include applicable security controls.

Validation should confirm that the Release Framework supports:

* security evidence;
* security gates;
* exception governance;
* artifact integrity;
* authorized deployment.

Critical security requirements must not be optional through accidental framework gaps.

---

## Level 5 — Operational Validation

Operational validation determines whether the Release Framework can govern an actual release.

This should use representative release scenarios.

The objective is to validate behavior, not merely documentation.

---

## Representative Release Scenario

A validation scenario may follow:

```text id="1jfrqf"
Change Prepared
      |
      v
Build Completed
      |
      v
Tests Passed
      |
      v
Quality Passed
      |
      v
Release Candidate Created
      |
      v
Readiness Evaluated
      |
      v
Release Approved
      |
      v
Deployment Performed
      |
      v
Runtime Verified
      |
      v
Release Accepted
```

The framework must provide clear guidance at every stage.

---

## Failure Scenario Validation

The framework must also be tested against failure.

Example:

```text id="osg5td"
Production Deployment
        |
        v
Verification Failure
        |
        v
Risk Assessment
        |
        v
Rollback Decision
        |
        v
Rollback
        |
        v
Recovery Verification
```

If the framework provides no clear decision path, validation fails.

---

## Migration Scenario Validation

A release containing a database migration should be used as a high-risk validation scenario.

Validation should determine whether the framework answers:

* Is the migration reversible?
* Is the previous application version compatible?
* Is backup readiness required?
* How is residual risk evaluated?
* What happens if migration succeeds but application deployment fails?
* What evidence proves recovery?

This validates cross-domain completeness.

---

## Plugin Release Scenario Validation

A representative plugin release should verify:

* plugin identity;
* plugin compliance status;
* compatibility;
* test evidence;
* release readiness;
* artifact identity;
* deployment;
* plugin observability;
* plugin rollback.

This confirms that the Release Framework correctly supports the FamilyOS plugin architecture.

---

## Emergency Release Scenario Validation

The framework must support urgent corrective releases without eliminating essential controls.

Validation should verify that an emergency release still preserves:

* identity;
* traceability;
* critical validation;
* approval;
* deployment evidence;
* recovery strategy;
* post-release verification.

Emergency must mean accelerated, not uncontrolled.

---

## Rollback Scenario Validation

A rollback simulation should verify that the framework identifies:

* affected release;
* rollback trigger;
* rollback authority;
* previous stable release;
* rollback artifact;
* recovery validation;
* final platform state.

A rollback process that cannot prove restoration is incomplete.

---

## Compliance Scenario Validation

A compliance failure scenario should verify fail-closed behavior.

Example:

```text id="0y5zkw"
Required Security Evidence
        |
        v
Unavailable
        |
        v
Compliance Status = PENDING/BLOCKED
```

It must not become:

```text id="moaa37"
PASS
```

through missing data.

---

## Unknown State Validation

The framework must correctly represent uncertainty.

Examples include:

```text id="7kzaez"
UNKNOWN
PENDING
UNAVAILABLE
NOT_EVALUATED
```

Unknown states must not silently resolve to success.

This is a critical validation property.

---

## Automation Validation

As automation is introduced, automated release controls must themselves be validated.

Automation validation should verify:

* correct inputs;
* correct gate evaluation;
* deterministic results;
* safe failure behavior;
* evidence output;
* audit logging.

Automation must fail safely.

---

## Policy Validation

Release policies should be tested against known examples.

For example:

```text id="m6arpx"
critical_tests_failed == true
```

must result in a blocked release where policy requires it.

Similarly:

```text id="lqse7w"
artifact_verified == false
```

must not permit production promotion.

---

## Release Manifest Validation

A structured release manifest should eventually receive schema validation.

Validation may check:

```text id="ied40d"
release.version
release.type
release.risk
source.commit
artifact.id
validation.status
recovery.classification
```

Required fields must not be missing.

Invalid manifests must fail early.

---

## Version Validation

Release versions must comply with the FamilyOS versioning model.

Validation should check:

* syntax;
* uniqueness;
* tag consistency;
* artifact consistency;
* documentation consistency.

A release must not expose conflicting versions across its artifacts.

---

## Tag Validation

Production release tags should be verified for:

* correct format;
* correct commit reference;
* uniqueness;
* immutability expectations.

Tag mutation after release publication must be treated as a governance violation.

---

## Artifact Validation

Release artifact validation should verify:

* expected identity;
* checksum or digest;
* provenance;
* release version;
* source relationship.

The deployed artifact must match the approved artifact.

---

## Documentation Validation

Release-related documentation should be checked for:

* release version;
* changelog entry;
* release notes where required;
* migration instructions where applicable;
* rollback information;
* known issues.

Documentation gaps must be visible before release approval.

---

## Readiness Validation

Release readiness validation should confirm all applicable readiness requirements.

A conceptual validation set may include:

```text id="2a3l5d"
build_ready == true
tests_ready == true
quality_ready == true
security_ready == true
documentation_ready == true
rollback_ready == true
observability_ready == true
compliance_ready == true
risk_accepted == true
```

Not every release needs identical controls.

The applicable profile must determine required conditions.

---

## Approval Validation

Approval evidence should be validated for:

* correct release;
* correct scope;
* authorized approver;
* timestamp;
* decision;
* unresolved conditions.

Approval of an earlier artifact must not automatically approve a changed artifact.

---

## Deployment Validation

Deployment validation should confirm:

* correct environment;
* correct artifact;
* authorized deployment;
* deployment event recorded;
* deployment completion status;
* target release identity visible.

The framework must distinguish deployment completion from release acceptance.

---

## Post-Deployment Validation

Post-deployment validation should confirm:

* health;
* critical workflows;
* required metrics;
* error thresholds;
* dependency status;
* plugin status;
* security signals;
* stabilization state.

Final release success requires runtime evidence.

---

## Rollback Validation

Rollback validation should verify:

```text id="q1j0ew"
previous_release_identified == true
rollback_artifact_available == true
rollback_authorized == true
rollback_executed == true
recovery_verified == true
```

The rollback process should be testable in non-production environments where practical.

---

## Recovery Validation

Recovery validation must verify the actual restored state.

Relevant checks include:

* platform availability;
* critical functionality;
* data integrity;
* security controls;
* configuration;
* dependencies;
* monitoring.

Recovery is complete only when the restored state is acceptable.

---

## Evidence Validation

Release evidence itself must be validated.

Evidence should be:

* attributable;
* timestamped;
* relevant;
* linked to the correct release;
* protected from unauthorized modification where required.

Evidence from a different release must not satisfy the current release.

---

## Traceability Validation

The framework should eventually support end-to-end traceability such as:

```text id="gmvtlp"
Requirement
    |
    v
Source Change
    |
    v
Commit
    |
    v
Build
    |
    v
Artifact
    |
    v
Tests
    |
    v
Release
    |
    v
Deployment
    |
    v
Runtime Evidence
```

Broken traceability links should be identifiable.

---

## Risk Validation

Risk management validation should confirm:

* release risk assigned;
* significant risks documented;
* owners assigned;
* mitigation defined;
* residual risk evaluated;
* high-risk acceptance explicit.

Critical unknown risks must not silently pass readiness.

---

## Compliance Validation

Compliance validation should determine an explicit state.

For example:

```text id="4lx2dm"
COMPLIANT
COMPLIANT_WITH_EXCEPTIONS
NON_COMPLIANT
PENDING
```

The state must be derived from required controls and evidence.

---

## Observability Validation

Release observability should itself be tested.

Validation should confirm:

* release identity is visible;
* deployment markers appear;
* health checks work;
* metrics are available;
* logs contain release context;
* required alerts function.

Missing required telemetry should be detected before it becomes an incident.

---

## Metrics Validation

Release metrics should be validated for:

* formula correctness;
* data source correctness;
* segmentation;
* missing data handling;
* consistent units.

Metrics should never silently convert unavailable data into zero.

---

## Validation Automation

The long-term goal is to automate as much framework validation as practical.

Potential automated checks include:

```text id="8x3y5d"
document_inventory_valid
document_names_valid
required_sections_present
release_manifest_valid
version_consistent
artifact_verified
required_evidence_present
release_gates_defined
rollback_plan_present
observability_requirements_present
```

Automation should produce an explicit validation result.

---

## Validation Status

The Release Framework should expose a final validation status.

Recommended states are:

```text id="sh0d8x"
PASS
PASS_WITH_FINDINGS
FAIL
PENDING
```

### PASS

All mandatory validation requirements are satisfied.

### PASS_WITH_FINDINGS

The framework is valid, but non-blocking improvement findings remain.

### FAIL

One or more mandatory validation requirements are not satisfied.

### PENDING

Validation is incomplete.

---

## Validation Findings

Validation findings should be categorized by severity.

Recommended levels include:

```text id="lrqfxf"
CRITICAL
HIGH
MEDIUM
LOW
INFO
```

Critical and high findings should generally block framework completion unless explicitly accepted by governance.

---

## Finding Record

A validation finding may include:

```text id="3wb4ka"
finding_id
validation_area
description
severity
evidence
owner
status
resolution
```

Findings should remain traceable until resolved or accepted.

---

## Validation Checklist

A final validation checklist should include at minimum:

```text id="ht5rs6"
[ ] Required Release Framework documents exist
[ ] No required documents are empty
[ ] Document naming is consistent
[ ] Release terminology is consistent
[ ] Release lifecycle is coherent
[ ] Release states are coherent
[ ] Release readiness requirements are complete
[ ] Release gates align with framework requirements
[ ] Evidence requirements are defined
[ ] Build integration is defined
[ ] Testing integration is defined
[ ] Quality integration is defined
[ ] Security integration is defined
[ ] Plugin compliance integration is defined
[ ] Rollback and recovery are defined
[ ] Release observability is defined
[ ] Release compliance is defined
[ ] Release metrics are defined
[ ] Release risk management is defined
[ ] Governance is defined
[ ] Roadmap is defined
[ ] Cross-document contradictions are resolved
[ ] Operational scenarios can be executed conceptually
```

This checklist forms the minimum final review.

---

## Repository Validation

Repository-level validation should also confirm that the framework can be represented cleanly in source control.

Checks may include:

```text id="qx9f3f"
git status
document inventory
empty files
duplicate numbers
heading consistency
reference validity
```

Validation commands should be reproducible.

---

## Suggested Structural Validation Commands

A repository validation sequence may include commands conceptually similar to:

```bash id="3nkpj3"
EPIC_DIR="docs/epics/EPIC-REL-001-release-framework"

find "$EPIC_DIR" -maxdepth 1 -type f | sort

find "$EPIC_DIR" -maxdepth 1 -type f -empty -print

find "$EPIC_DIR" -maxdepth 1 -type f \
  -name '[0-9][0-9]-*.md' \
  -exec basename {} \; | sort

grep -R "^# Release Framework" "$EPIC_DIR"
```

Repository-specific validation scripts may replace manual commands later.

---

## Validation Evidence

Completion of EPIC-REL-001 should produce validation evidence.

Evidence may include:

* document inventory;
* file size report;
* empty-file report;
* duplicate-number report;
* heading validation;
* reference validation;
* framework checklist;
* final validation status.

The evidence should be stored or referenced through the canonical validation artifacts.

---

## Validation Ownership

The Release Framework must have an identifiable validation owner.

The validation owner is responsible for:

* coordinating validation;
* recording findings;
* ensuring blocking issues are resolved;
* confirming final validation status.

Validation ownership may be shared with framework governance where appropriate.

---

## Validation Review

Final validation should be reviewed before the Release Framework is declared complete.

The review should confirm:

* structural completeness;
* conceptual completeness;
* framework integration;
* operational applicability;
* unresolved findings;
* final status.

The review should focus on material issues.

---

## Framework Acceptance

The Release Framework may be accepted when:

```text id="xar4q3"
structure_validation == PASS
content_validation == PASS
cross_document_validation == PASS
integration_validation == PASS
operational_validation in [PASS, PASS_WITH_FINDINGS]
critical_findings == 0
high_blocking_findings == 0
```

Acceptance criteria may evolve with governance.

---

## Validation and Versioning

Validation applies to a specific framework version.

A future material change to the Release Framework may invalidate part of the previous validation.

Therefore:

```text id="g7hdyo"
Framework Change
      |
      v
Impact Assessment
      |
      v
Required Revalidation
```

Not every editorial change requires complete revalidation.

Material normative changes do.

---

## Continuous Validation

As the Release Framework becomes automated, validation should become continuous.

Future validation may run:

* on pull requests;
* on framework changes;
* on release policy changes;
* before framework version publication.

This reduces validation drift.

---

## Validation Drift

Validation drift occurs when the documented framework and actual release behavior diverge.

Examples include:

* new deployment processes not reflected in documentation;
* obsolete release gates;
* undocumented exceptions;
* metrics no longer generated;
* changed release roles.

Periodic validation must identify this drift.

---

## Validation and Continuous Improvement

Validation findings should feed framework evolution.

Repeated findings may indicate:

* unclear architecture;
* excessive complexity;
* missing automation;
* poor terminology;
* weak integration;
* outdated controls.

Validation is therefore both an acceptance mechanism and an improvement mechanism.

---

## Anti-Patterns

The following practices are prohibited or strongly discouraged.

### File Presence Equals Validation

Treating existing Markdown files as proof that the framework is complete.

### Size-Based Validation Only

Assuming large documents are automatically high quality.

### Independent Document Review Only

Validating documents individually while ignoring cross-document contradictions.

### Manual Success Assumption

Declaring the framework valid without explicit validation evidence.

### Missing Operational Scenarios

Validating theory without checking whether real release situations can be governed.

### Ignoring Unknown States

Treating missing evidence as successful validation.

### Validation Without Findings

Silently fixing or ignoring issues without maintaining traceability where findings matter.

### Never Revalidating

Assuming a framework remains valid after major architectural changes.

---

## Required Outcomes

Implementation of this validation model must ensure that:

* the Release Framework inventory is complete;
* required documents are non-empty and substantive;
* naming and terminology are consistent;
* the release lifecycle is coherent;
* release states and gates are internally consistent;
* evidence requirements are traceable;
* rollback, observability, compliance, metrics, and risk are integrated;
* adjacent FamilyOS frameworks are referenced correctly;
* representative release scenarios are supported;
* missing or unknown evidence does not become PASS;
* validation produces explicit findings;
* final framework status is unambiguous;
* future material changes trigger appropriate revalidation.

---

## Final Validation Principle

The Release Framework cannot govern production change reliably unless the framework itself has been validated.

Documentation volume is not sufficient.

Validation must demonstrate that the architecture is complete, consistent, actionable, and supported by explicit evidence.

The final principle is:

> EPIC-REL-001 is complete only when the FamilyOS Release Framework can be structurally verified, conceptually validated, integrated with the surrounding engineering foundations, and applied consistently to both successful and failed release scenarios.

Validation therefore provides the final evidence that the Release Framework is ready to function as a trusted engineering foundation for FamilyOS release governance.
