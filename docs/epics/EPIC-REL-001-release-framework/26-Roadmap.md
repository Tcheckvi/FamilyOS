# Release Framework

## 26 Roadmap

### Overview

The FamilyOS Release Framework roadmap defines the planned evolution of release engineering from a documented governance model into a fully integrated, automated, observable, and continuously improving platform capability.

The roadmap establishes direction.

It does not attempt to prescribe every implementation detail in advance.

Its purpose is to ensure that release engineering evolves deliberately across several dimensions:

* governance;
* automation;
* build integration;
* testing integration;
* quality integration;
* compliance;
* deployment;
* observability;
* rollback and recovery;
* metrics;
* risk management;
* developer experience.

The roadmap must remain aligned with the broader FamilyOS engineering platform.

The governing principle is:

> The Release Framework must evolve incrementally from defined process to reliable automation without sacrificing traceability, safety, or architectural clarity.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this roadmap is to define how the Release Framework should mature over time.

It provides a structured progression for:

* establishing the release foundation;
* standardizing release workflows;
* integrating release gates;
* automating evidence collection;
* strengthening production safety;
* improving observability;
* formalizing rollback and recovery;
* measuring release performance;
* enabling progressive delivery;
* improving developer experience;
* integrating governance across FamilyOS frameworks.

The roadmap is intended to guide implementation priorities while allowing adaptation as FamilyOS evolves.

---

## Roadmap Principles

The Release Framework roadmap follows several principles.

### Architecture Before Automation

Automation must implement a defined release model.

Automation must not become the architecture.

### Safety Before Speed

Faster releases are valuable only when reliability, security, compliance, and recovery remain protected.

### Evidence Before Assertion

Release success must increasingly be demonstrated through machine-verifiable evidence.

### Incremental Adoption

The framework should mature in controlled stages rather than require all advanced capabilities immediately.

### Integration Over Duplication

The Release Framework should consume capabilities from existing FamilyOS frameworks rather than reimplement them.

### Reversible Evolution

Where practical, roadmap changes should preserve compatibility and allow controlled migration.

### Developer Usability

Release controls must remain understandable and usable by engineers.

---

## Strategic Direction

The long-term direction of the Release Framework is:

```text
Manual and Documented
        |
        v
Standardized
        |
        v
Automated
        |
        v
Observable
        |
        v
Risk-Aware
        |
        v
Progressive
        |
        v
Adaptive
```

Each stage builds on the controls established by the previous stage.

---

## Roadmap Dimensions

The roadmap evolves across the following dimensions:

```text
Governance
Versioning
Release Workflow
Release Gates
Artifact Promotion
Automation
Compliance
Observability
Rollback and Recovery
Risk Management
Metrics
Progressive Delivery
Developer Experience
```

These dimensions should evolve together.

Optimizing one while neglecting the others creates an unbalanced release system.

---

## Phase 1 — Release Foundation

The first phase establishes the normative Release Framework.

The objective is to create a stable release language, structure, governance model, and lifecycle.

Primary outcomes include:

* official release terminology;
* defined release lifecycle;
* release ownership;
* versioning rules;
* release candidate model;
* approval model;
* readiness model;
* release evidence model;
* rollback expectations;
* compliance model;
* risk model.

This phase is primarily architectural and documentary.

---

## Phase 1 Deliverables

Expected deliverables include:

```text
Release Framework documentation
Release lifecycle definition
Release versioning model
Release readiness model
Release gate model
Release evidence model
Release risk model
Rollback and recovery requirements
Compliance requirements
Observability requirements
Metrics definitions
```

The framework must be coherent before implementation becomes heavily automated.

---

## Phase 1 Exit Criteria

Phase 1 is complete when:

```text
[ ] Release lifecycle is formally defined
[ ] Roles and responsibilities are defined
[ ] Release states are defined
[ ] Release readiness requirements are defined
[ ] Release gate concepts are defined
[ ] Rollback expectations are documented
[ ] Compliance requirements are documented
[ ] Risk management requirements are documented
[ ] Observability requirements are documented
[ ] Metrics are defined
```

Completion means the release architecture is sufficiently stable to guide implementation.

---

## Phase 2 — Standardized Release Workflow

The second phase transforms the framework into a repeatable engineering workflow.

The objective is to reduce release variation.

A standardized workflow should define:

```text
Change
  |
  v
Build
  |
  v
Test
  |
  v
Quality
  |
  v
Release Candidate
  |
  v
Readiness
  |
  v
Approval
  |
  v
Deployment
  |
  v
Verification
  |
  v
Acceptance
```

Each significant release should follow an identifiable path through this lifecycle.

---

## Phase 2 Priorities

Priorities include:

* standardized release candidate creation;
* release manifests;
* release metadata;
* consistent version generation;
* changelog integration;
* release notes structure;
* formal readiness checklist;
* deployment records;
* release status tracking.

The objective is repeatability before advanced automation.

---

## Release Manifest Introduction

A structured release manifest should become a central release artifact.

Conceptually:

```yaml
release:
  version: vX.Y.Z
  type: platform
  risk: medium
  environment: production

source:
  commit: "<sha>"

artifact:
  id: "<artifact-id>"

validation:
  build: pass
  tests: pass
  quality: pass
  compliance: pass

recovery:
  rollback_classification: direct

status:
  readiness: approved
```

The exact schema may evolve.

The principle is machine-readable release identity and state.

---

## Phase 3 — CI Integration

The third phase integrates release controls into continuous integration.

Manual verification should increasingly be replaced by authoritative automated evidence.

CI should produce release-relevant evidence for:

* builds;
* tests;
* quality;
* security;
* dependency checks;
* artifact identity;
* documentation validation.

The release system should consume this evidence directly.

---

## CI Gate Integration

The target flow becomes:

```text
Commit
  |
  v
Build
  |
  v
Automated Tests
  |
  v
Quality Validation
  |
  v
Security Validation
  |
  v
Artifact Creation
  |
  v
Release Eligibility
```

Failed mandatory controls must prevent unauthorized release progression.

---

## Phase 3 Exit Criteria

Phase 3 should establish:

```text
[ ] Automated build validation
[ ] Automated test evidence
[ ] Automated quality evidence
[ ] Automated artifact identity
[ ] Automated release metadata generation
[ ] Machine-readable gate results
```

Manual review remains possible, but foundational evidence should no longer depend primarily on manual transcription.

---

## Phase 4 — Artifact Promotion

The next maturity step introduces explicit artifact promotion.

The same artifact should move through approved release environments.

The preferred model is:

```text
Build Once
    |
    v
Artifact
    |
    +------> Testing
    |
    +------> Staging
    |
    +------> Production
```

The artifact must not be rebuilt between release stages unless the release identity changes.

---

## Artifact Promotion Goals

Artifact promotion should provide:

* artifact immutability;
* integrity verification;
* provenance;
* promotion history;
* environment traceability;
* rollback artifact availability.

This significantly strengthens release confidence.

---

## Phase 5 — Automated Release Gates

The fifth phase introduces stronger automated release gating.

Release gates should evaluate evidence from multiple frameworks.

Example:

```text
Build Gate
    |
    v
Testing Gate
    |
    v
Quality Gate
    |
    v
Security Gate
    |
    v
Compliance Gate
    |
    v
Release Readiness Gate
```

A release progresses only when required conditions are satisfied.

---

## Gate Policy Model

Future implementation should support policy-driven evaluation such as:

```text
required_tests_passed == true
quality_gate_passed == true
security_gate_passed == true
artifact_verified == true
release_documentation_present == true
rollback_plan_present == true
```

This may eventually evolve toward policy-as-code.

---

## Phase 6 — Release Observability

The next phase integrates release identity with runtime observability.

The platform should be able to answer:

```text
Which release is running?
When was it deployed?
Which artifact is active?
Is the release healthy?
Did behavior change after deployment?
```

Runtime evidence must become part of release verification.

---

## Observability Integration Goals

The roadmap should introduce:

* deployment markers;
* release-aware metrics;
* structured release logs;
* health checks;
* release-specific dashboards;
* alert correlation;
* version visibility;
* plugin release visibility.

This establishes production release awareness.

---

## Phase 7 — Automated Post-Deployment Verification

Post-deployment verification should progressively become automated.

The release system should evaluate:

```text
deployment_completed
health_checks_passed
critical_workflows_passed
error_rate_acceptable
latency_acceptable
critical_alerts_absent
```

A deployment should not automatically become a successful release.

---

## Release Acceptance Automation

The future model should become:

```text
Deployment
    |
    v
Verification
    |
    +------ Fail ------> Recovery Decision
    |
   Pass
    |
    v
Stabilization
    |
    v
Release Acceptance
```

Acceptance should increasingly depend on evidence rather than manual declaration.

---

## Phase 8 — Rollback Automation

Rollback should evolve from documented procedure to tested operational capability.

The roadmap should progressively introduce:

* automatic previous-version identification;
* preserved rollback artifacts;
* configuration rollback support;
* rollback execution tooling;
* rollback event tracking;
* recovery verification.

Rollback automation must remain governed.

---

## Rollback Safety

Automated rollback should only be introduced where recovery semantics are understood.

The system must not blindly reverse:

* destructive migrations;
* incompatible schemas;
* irreversible data transformations.

Rollback capability must remain classified per release.

---

## Phase 9 — Risk-Aware Release Management

Release controls should evolve from static rules toward risk-aware behavior.

For example:

```text
LOW RISK
  |
  +-- standard gates
  +-- standard verification

HIGH RISK
  |
  +-- enhanced validation
  +-- stronger approval
  +-- progressive delivery
  +-- extended stabilization
```

This allows control depth to match release impact.

---

## Automated Risk Inputs

Risk classification may eventually incorporate objective signals such as:

* change size;
* affected components;
* migration presence;
* dependency changes;
* historical failure rates;
* security-sensitive changes;
* rollback capability;
* test coverage;
* observability readiness.

Automation should support, not replace, engineering judgment.

---

## Phase 10 — Progressive Delivery

Progressive delivery should be introduced for releases where staged exposure provides meaningful risk reduction.

Supported patterns may include:

* canary deployment;
* phased rollout;
* rolling deployment;
* blue-green deployment;
* feature flag activation.

The release system should evaluate evidence between stages.

---

## Progressive Release Model

A target model is:

```text
Release Candidate
      |
      v
Limited Exposure
      |
      v
Observe
      |
   +--+--+
   |     |
 Fail   Pass
   |     |
   v     v
Recover Expand
           |
           v
       Full Release
```

This reduces blast radius.

---

## Phase 11 — Compliance Automation

Release compliance should increasingly become machine-verifiable.

The roadmap should enable automatic evaluation of:

* release ownership;
* required approvals;
* artifact integrity;
* required testing;
* quality gates;
* security gates;
* documentation;
* rollback readiness;
* observability readiness.

The release system should expose a formal compliance state.

---

## Target Compliance States

The long-term model should support explicit states such as:

```text
COMPLIANT
COMPLIANT_WITH_EXCEPTIONS
NON_COMPLIANT
PENDING
```

These states should be derived from authoritative evidence where practical.

---

## Phase 12 — Release Metrics Platform

Release metrics should become automatically derived from lifecycle events.

The system should calculate metrics such as:

* release frequency;
* release success rate;
* deployment success rate;
* change failure rate;
* rollback rate;
* rollback success rate;
* mean time to detect;
* mean time to recover;
* release lead time;
* compliance exception rate.

Metrics should no longer depend primarily on manual reporting.

---

## Release Analytics

A future analytics capability should support:

```text
Release Type
Environment
Risk Level
Component
Plugin
Time Period
```

as analysis dimensions.

This enables meaningful comparison without misleading aggregation.

---

## Phase 13 — Release Intelligence

Once sufficient historical evidence exists, FamilyOS may introduce higher-level release intelligence.

Potential capabilities include:

* regression trend detection;
* risk pattern identification;
* recurring gate-failure analysis;
* release health prediction;
* rollback probability estimation;
* dependency risk signals.

These capabilities must remain advisory unless governed automation explicitly authorizes stronger action.

---

## Predictive Release Risk

A future system may infer:

```text
Large migration
+
High historical migration failure rate
+
Weak rollback capability
+
Low observability coverage
=
Elevated Release Risk
```

Such inference can improve readiness decisions.

It must remain explainable.

---

## Phase 14 — Adaptive Release Controls

At high maturity, release controls may adapt automatically to release context.

For example:

```text
Documentation Change
      |
      v
Lightweight Profile

Core Security Change
      |
      v
Critical Release Profile
```

This enables strong controls without imposing unnecessary process everywhere.

Adaptive policies must remain transparent and governable.

---

## Developer Experience Roadmap

Release maturity must improve developer experience as well as governance.

Future capabilities should reduce manual work through:

* release CLI commands;
* automatic version calculation;
* release manifest generation;
* changelog generation;
* release readiness validation;
* evidence aggregation;
* release status display.

The objective is to make the compliant path the easiest path.

---

## FamilyOS Release CLI

A future FamilyOS CLI release interface may provide commands conceptually similar to:

```text
familyos release prepare
familyos release validate
familyos release status
familyos release approve
familyos release deploy
familyos release verify
familyos release rollback
familyos release report
```

Exact command design belongs to implementation planning.

The roadmap establishes the desired capability.

---

## Release Validation Command

A future command such as:

```text
familyos release validate
```

could evaluate:

* version;
* release manifest;
* test evidence;
* quality evidence;
* artifact integrity;
* documentation;
* compliance;
* rollback readiness.

This would provide developers with early feedback before formal release gating.

---

## Release Status Capability

A release status command should eventually expose a concise view such as:

```text
Release: vX.Y.Z
State: READY
Risk: MEDIUM

Build: PASS
Tests: PASS
Quality: PASS
Security: PASS
Compliance: COMPLIANT
Rollback: READY
Observability: READY
```

This reduces fragmented release information.

---

## Release Evidence Aggregation

The roadmap should move toward centralized evidence references.

Instead of manually collecting evidence from multiple systems:

```text
Build System
Testing System
Quality System
Security System
Deployment System
Observability System
```

the Release Framework should aggregate authoritative references.

---

## Integration With Build Framework

The Release Framework roadmap depends on the Build Framework for:

* reproducible builds;
* immutable artifacts;
* artifact metadata;
* provenance;
* integrity.

Release automation should consume Build Framework outputs directly.

---

## Integration With Testing Framework

The Testing Framework provides:

* test execution;
* test evidence;
* regression confidence;
* compatibility validation;
* recovery testing.

The Release Framework must reference testing evidence rather than duplicate test infrastructure.

---

## Integration With Quality Framework

The Quality Framework provides:

* quality gates;
* defect expectations;
* quality metrics;
* quality evidence.

Release progression should increasingly consume quality gate results automatically.

---

## Integration With Plugin Compliance Framework

Plugin releases should integrate Plugin Compliance Framework results.

A future plugin release flow may become:

```text
Plugin Build
    |
    v
Plugin Compliance
    |
    v
Testing
    |
    v
Release Validation
    |
    v
Artifact Promotion
    |
    v
Plugin Release
```

Plugin compliance is an eligibility input, not a replacement for release governance.

---

## Integration With Security

Security validation should increasingly become part of release evidence.

Future integrations may include:

* dependency scanning;
* secret scanning;
* artifact verification;
* policy validation;
* security exception tracking.

Security requirements must remain independently governed.

---

## Integration With Documentation Framework

Release documentation should increasingly be generated and validated consistently.

Relevant integration areas include:

* changelog standards;
* release notes;
* migration documentation;
* rollback documentation;
* release references;
* version consistency.

Documentation should remain synchronized with actual release state.

---

## Governance Roadmap

Release governance should evolve from manual review toward policy-backed governance.

The progression is:

```text
Documented Rules
      |
      v
Checklists
      |
      v
Structured Evidence
      |
      v
Automated Gates
      |
      v
Policy as Code
```

Human authority remains necessary for contextual decisions and risk acceptance.

---

## Policy-as-Code Roadmap

Suitable release requirements may eventually become machine-enforced.

Examples include:

```text
deny if artifact_unverified
deny if required_tests_failed
deny if critical_security_finding
deny if approval_missing
deny if production_recovery_plan_missing
```

Policies must be versioned and reviewed.

---

## Evidence Maturity Roadmap

Release evidence should evolve through several stages.

```text
Level 1
Manual statements

Level 2
Linked system evidence

Level 3
Structured machine-readable evidence

Level 4
Automatically aggregated evidence

Level 5
Continuously evaluated evidence
```

This progression improves auditability and automation.

---

## Observability Maturity Roadmap

Observability should evolve through:

```text
Basic Health
    |
    v
Release-Aware Metrics
    |
    v
Correlated Logs and Traces
    |
    v
Automated Verification
    |
    v
Progressive Delivery Decisions
```

Each stage increases runtime confidence.

---

## Recovery Maturity Roadmap

Recovery capability should evolve through:

```text
Documented Rollback
      |
      v
Tested Rollback
      |
      v
Automated Rollback
      |
      v
Observed Recovery
      |
      v
Risk-Aware Automated Recovery
```

Automation must only advance where recovery semantics are proven.

---

## Metrics Maturity Roadmap

Release measurement should evolve through:

```text
Manual Collection
      |
      v
Defined Metrics
      |
      v
Automated Collection
      |
      v
Trend Analysis
      |
      v
Predictive Insight
```

Metrics must remain explainable.

---

## Near-Term Priorities

Near-term implementation should prioritize foundation capabilities with high leverage.

Recommended priorities are:

```text
1. Release manifest model
2. Release state model
3. Release readiness validation
4. Version and tag validation
5. Evidence references
6. Release compliance status
7. Rollback classification
8. Release observability metadata
9. Release metrics event model
```

These provide the basis for later automation.

---

## Medium-Term Priorities

Medium-term priorities should include:

```text
Automated release gates
Artifact promotion
Deployment markers
Automated post-deployment verification
Release dashboards
Risk profiles
Compliance automation
Rollback tooling
```

These capabilities move the framework from documentation into active platform governance.

---

## Long-Term Priorities

Long-term priorities may include:

```text
Progressive delivery
Adaptive release policies
Predictive risk analysis
Automated recovery
Release intelligence
Cross-framework evidence graph
```

These should only be introduced after foundational release data and controls are reliable.

---

## Release Evidence Graph

A long-term goal is to establish end-to-end release traceability.

Conceptually:

```text
Requirement
    |
    v
Source Change
    |
    v
Build
    |
    v
Artifact
    |
    v
Tests
    |
    v
Quality
    |
    v
Compliance
    |
    v
Release
    |
    v
Deployment
    |
    v
Runtime Evidence
```

This graph provides a complete engineering history for each production change.

---

## Cross-Framework Integration

The Release Framework should eventually act as the final orchestration layer across FamilyOS engineering foundations.

Conceptually:

```text
Engineering
    |
    +--> Build Framework
    |
    +--> Testing Framework
    |
    +--> Quality Framework
    |
    +--> Plugin Compliance Framework
    |
    +--> Security Controls
    |
    +--> Documentation Framework
    |
    v
Release Framework
    |
    v
Production
```

The Release Framework should consume validated outcomes from these systems rather than duplicate them.

---

## Roadmap Dependencies

Roadmap execution depends on maturity in several areas.

Important dependencies include:

* reliable CI;
* stable build artifacts;
* structured test evidence;
* quality gate availability;
* secure deployment identities;
* observability infrastructure;
* stable versioning conventions.

Roadmap phases may therefore progress at different speeds.

---

## Roadmap Sequencing

Not every capability must be implemented strictly one after another.

Some workstreams may progress in parallel.

However, dependencies must be respected.

For example:

```text
Artifact Promotion
```

requires stable artifact identity.

```text
Automated Release Acceptance
```

requires reliable observability.

```text
Predictive Risk
```

requires historical metrics.

Architecture dependencies must guide sequencing.

---

## Adoption Strategy

FamilyOS should adopt Release Framework capabilities progressively.

A reasonable adoption sequence is:

```text
Documentation
    |
    v
Manual Governance
    |
    v
Structured Metadata
    |
    v
Automated Validation
    |
    v
Automated Gates
    |
    v
Runtime Integration
    |
    v
Advanced Delivery
```

This limits implementation risk.

---

## Migration of Existing Releases

Existing release practices may need migration toward the framework.

Migration should avoid unnecessary historical rewriting.

The preferred approach is:

* apply new controls to future releases;
* normalize current versioning where necessary;
* preserve existing historical tags;
* introduce structured release records incrementally;
* improve evidence from the point of adoption forward.

Historical release integrity should be preserved.

---

## Backward Compatibility

Release tooling should evolve with compatibility in mind.

Changes to:

* release manifests;
* metadata schemas;
* CLI commands;
* gate policies;

should provide migration strategies where practical.

The Release Framework itself should follow controlled versioning.

---

## Roadmap Governance

This roadmap is governed by the FamilyOS Release Framework.

Roadmap changes should consider:

* platform architecture;
* engineering priorities;
* operational evidence;
* framework dependencies;
* security implications;
* implementation capacity.

Major changes may require ADRs or corresponding architectural decisions.

---

## Roadmap Review

The roadmap should be reviewed periodically.

Reviews should evaluate:

* completed capabilities;
* delayed capabilities;
* new architectural requirements;
* release incident findings;
* metrics trends;
* tooling maturity;
* dependency changes.

The roadmap should remain stable enough to guide engineering while adaptable enough to reflect evidence.

---

## Prioritization Model

Roadmap priorities should consider:

```text
Risk Reduction
      +
Engineering Value
      +
Platform Dependency
      +
Implementation Cost
      +
Operational Need
```

Capabilities that substantially reduce release risk while enabling later work should receive higher priority.

---

## Success Indicators

The roadmap is succeeding when FamilyOS demonstrates:

* reproducible release workflows;
* trusted artifacts;
* automated validation;
* explicit release states;
* strong release traceability;
* low unplanned manual intervention;
* reliable rollback;
* rapid failure detection;
* measurable release outcomes;
* risk-aware deployment;
* consistent compliance;
* strong developer usability.

No single indicator defines maturity.

---

## Target End State

The long-term target state is a Release Framework where:

```text
Change
  |
  v
Build
  |
  v
Automated Evidence
  |
  v
Risk Evaluation
  |
  v
Release Gates
  |
  v
Artifact Promotion
  |
  v
Progressive Deployment
  |
  v
Automated Verification
  |
  v
Release Acceptance
  |
  v
Continuous Observation
```

and where failure follows an equally controlled path:

```text
Failure
  |
  v
Detection
  |
  v
Risk Assessment
  |
  v
Rollback / Recovery
  |
  v
Verification
  |
  v
Stable State
  |
  v
Learning
```

This represents release engineering as a complete operational capability.

---

## Non-Goals

The roadmap does not require:

* immediate full automation;
* removal of all human approval;
* deployment frequency as the primary objective;
* a single deployment technology;
* a single observability vendor;
* a single CI platform;
* complex predictive systems before foundational controls exist.

The framework defines capabilities rather than unnecessarily coupling FamilyOS to specific tools.

---

## Anti-Patterns

The roadmap must avoid several failure modes.

### Automating Undefined Processes

Building release automation before release states and rules are understood.

### Tool-Driven Architecture

Allowing CI or deployment products to define FamilyOS release architecture.

### Maximum Automation Immediately

Attempting advanced delivery before artifact, evidence, and recovery foundations exist.

### Speed Without Recovery

Optimizing deployment frequency before rollback and observability are reliable.

### Metrics Without Decisions

Building dashboards that do not influence release improvement.

### Compliance Without Developer Experience

Adding governance that engineers cannot understand or execute efficiently.

### Predictive Systems Without Data

Introducing release intelligence before sufficient reliable historical evidence exists.

### Permanent Roadmap

Treating the roadmap as immutable despite platform evolution.

---

## Required Outcomes

Execution of this roadmap must progressively ensure that:

* release workflows become standardized;
* release state becomes machine-readable;
* artifact promotion becomes trustworthy;
* validation becomes increasingly automated;
* release gates integrate engineering evidence;
* compliance becomes measurable;
* observability becomes release-aware;
* rollback becomes tested and increasingly automated;
* risk influences release control depth;
* metrics support continuous improvement;
* progressive delivery reduces blast radius;
* developer interaction with releases becomes simpler;
* cross-framework evidence becomes integrated.

---

## Final Roadmap Principle

The Release Framework must mature deliberately.

The objective is not maximum automation as quickly as possible.

The objective is a release capability that becomes progressively safer, more measurable, more reproducible, and easier to operate as FamilyOS grows.

The final principle is:

> FamilyOS must evolve release engineering in layers: first define the rules, then structure the evidence, then automate the controls, then observe the outcomes, and only then introduce increasingly adaptive release behavior.

The Release Framework roadmap therefore provides the evolutionary path from documented release governance to a mature engineering capability capable of supporting reliable FamilyOS platform evolution at scale.
