# Release Framework

## 02 Vision

### Overview

The vision of EPIC-REL-001 — Release Framework is to establish release engineering as a permanent, first-class capability of the FamilyOS platform.

FamilyOS must be able to transform validated engineering outputs into official releases through a process that is:

* explicit;
* repeatable;
* traceable;
* evidence-based;
* secure;
* automatable;
* observable;
* governable;
* recoverable;
* scalable.

The Release Framework must support both the current FamilyOS development model and the future evolution of the ecosystem into independently versioned platform components, plugins, SDKs, specifications, documentation packages, and other releasable assets.

The long-term objective is not merely to automate publishing.

The objective is to establish a release architecture in which every official FamilyOS release has a clear identity, a known source state, a validated artifact set, explicit evidence, governed approval, controlled publication, and recoverable operational state.

---

## Vision Statement

The FamilyOS Release Framework exists to ensure that every official release can be trusted as a controlled engineering state.

The target vision is:

> Every FamilyOS release is uniquely identifiable, traceable to its exact source and build context, validated against explicit release criteria, governed through controlled state transitions, published through secure and reproducible mechanisms, and supported by sufficient evidence for historical reconstruction and recovery.

This vision applies across all releasable FamilyOS assets.

---

## Strategic Intent

The Release Framework must prevent release engineering from becoming an accumulation of scripts, terminal commands, platform-specific conventions, or undocumented maintainer knowledge.

Instead, FamilyOS must establish a shared release model that separates:

```text
release semantics
        from
release implementation
```

Release semantics define:

* what a release is;
* what release states exist;
* what readiness means;
* what evidence is required;
* how release identity works;
* how versions are assigned;
* how release candidates are qualified;
* how approval occurs;
* what publication means;
* what recovery means.

Release implementation defines:

* which tools execute release workflows;
* which CI/CD platform is used;
* which registries receive artifacts;
* which commands create tags;
* which automation generates release notes;
* which systems store release evidence.

The semantics must remain stable even when implementations evolve.

---

## Long-Term Release Model

The long-term FamilyOS release model is a controlled progression from source state to officially consumable platform state.

```text
Controlled Source State
        │
        ▼
Reproducible Build
        │
        ▼
Validated Artifacts
        │
        ▼

        │
        ▼

        ▼

        ▼

        │
        ▼
Release Approval
        │
        ▼
Version Assignment
        │
        ▼
Repository Release Anchor
        │
        ▼
Publication
        │
        ▼
Distribution
        │
        ▼
Post-Release Verification
        │
        ▼
Operational Observation
        │
        ▼
Maintenance / Recovery
```

Every important transition must be explicit.

The framework must minimize hidden transitions and ambiguous states.

---

## Desired Release Properties

Every mature FamilyOS release should satisfy the following properties.

### Identifiable

A release must have one stable, unambiguous identity.

A maintainer, automation system, or consumer must be able to reference the release without uncertainty.

---

### Traceable

The release must be traceable to the source state from which it originated.

Traceability must connect:

```text
release
→ version
→ tag
→ source revision
→ build
→ artifacts
→ validation evidence
```

---

### Reproducible

Release operations should be reproducible wherever the surrounding systems allow it.

The same controlled inputs and release configuration should produce equivalent release behavior.

---

### Evidence-Based

A release must not depend solely on human confidence or informal judgment.

The release decision should be supported by objective evidence appropriate to the release type and risk.

---

### Immutable

Once an artifact has been officially published under a release identity, its meaning must remain stable.

The same release identity must not silently represent different artifact content over time.

---

### Governed

Release authority must be explicit.

The platform must know who or what may:

* approve a release;
* assign a version;
* create an official release tag;
* publish artifacts;
* withdraw a release;
* approve an exception;
* initiate emergency release procedures.

---

### Observable

Release execution must provide enough information to understand:

* current state;
* completed state transitions;
* failure state;
* publication state;
* validation state;
* recovery state.

---

### Recoverable

The release architecture must assume that failures will eventually occur.

The platform must provide defined strategies for:

* rollback;
* withdrawal;
* supersession;
* corrective releases;
* forward recovery;
* interrupted workflow recovery.

---

### Secure

Release infrastructure must preserve artifact and release integrity.

Unauthorized publication, tag manipulation, credential misuse, and artifact replacement must be treated as release security risks.

---

### Scalable

The release model must remain usable as FamilyOS grows from a relatively small repository into an ecosystem containing many releasable assets.

---

## Platform Release Vision

FamilyOS must eventually support a formal platform release identity.

A platform release may represent a coherent set of:

```text
FamilyOS Platform Release
├── core platform
├── CLI
├── official plugins
├── schemas
├── specifications
├── documentation
├── compatibility metadata
└── release evidence
```

Not every component must necessarily share the same internal lifecycle.

However, when components participate in an official platform release, their compatibility and release state must be explicit.

---

## Component Release Vision

Some FamilyOS components may evolve independently.

Examples may include:

* official plugins;
* SDKs;
* libraries;
* APIs;
* documentation packages;
* specifications;
* integration adapters;
* generation templates.

The Release Framework must support independent component releases without sacrificing ecosystem consistency.

This means the framework must distinguish between:

```text
platform release identity
```

and:

```text
component release identity
```

where necessary.

The relationship between these identities must remain traceable.

---

## Official Plugin Release Vision

Official plugins are expected to become a significant part of the FamilyOS ecosystem.

The release model must allow a plugin to communicate:

* its version;
* its release state;
* its platform compatibility;
* its dependency expectations;
* its compliance status;
* its artifact identity;
* its provenance;
* its release notes;
* its publication status.

Plugin release workflows should reuse the common Release Framework rather than invent incompatible release mechanisms.

---

## Versioning Vision

FamilyOS versioning must become predictable and meaningful.

Version identifiers must communicate intentional platform evolution.

The long-term strategy should enable maintainers to reason about:

* compatibility;
* change magnitude;
* release stability;
* pre-release status;
* historical ordering.

Version selection should eventually become sufficiently formal that automation can verify or calculate valid version transitions.

The framework should eliminate arbitrary version assignment.

---

## Tagging Vision

Git tags should serve as durable release anchors.

An official FamilyOS release tag should communicate that:

```text
this exact repository state
corresponds to
this official release identity
```

The long-term process should make it difficult to create an official release tag accidentally from:

* an incorrect branch;
* a dirty working tree;
* an unpublished commit;
* an invalid version;
* an unvalidated release candidate.

Tag creation must become the result of release qualification, not a substitute for it.

---

## Release Candidate Vision

A release candidate must become a concrete engineering object.

The candidate should have enough identity that all final validation can be associated with the exact object intended for publication.

The target relationship is:

```text
Candidate ID
    │
    ├── source revision
    ├── version intent
    ├── build identity
    ├── artifact set
    ├── dependency state
    ├── validation evidence
    └── release metadata
```

If any material element changes, candidate identity or candidate validation must change accordingly.

---

## Release Readiness Vision

Release readiness should eventually become machine-verifiable to the greatest practical extent.

Instead of a maintainer manually remembering every required step, the release system should be able to determine whether required evidence exists.

A conceptual readiness decision may become:

```text
Build                PASS
Tests                PASS
Quality              PASS
Compliance           PASS
Security             PASS
Documentation        PASS
Artifact Integrity   PASS
Repository State     PASS
Version              PASS
Release Notes        PASS
Risk                 ACCEPTABLE
--------------------------------
RELEASE READY
```

Human judgment may remain necessary for some decisions.

The framework should automate objective checks and preserve human authority for genuinely judgment-based decisions.

---

## Evidence Vision

Release evidence should become a structured engineering asset.

The long-term objective is to associate every significant release with a release evidence record.

A conceptual record may contain:

```text
release:
  version
  identifier
  type
  channel

source:
  repository
  branch
  revision

build:
  build_identifier
  artifact_set

validation:
  tests
  quality
  security
  compliance
  documentation

governance:
  approvals
  exceptions

publication:
  tag
  artifact_locations
  publication_state

recovery:
  rollback_strategy
  supersession_state
```

The specific serialization format is an implementation decision.

The architectural requirement is persistent, queryable release evidence.

---

## Provenance Vision

FamilyOS should progressively strengthen its software supply-chain provenance.

The maturity path may include:

```text
source commit traceability
        ↓
build identity
        ↓
artifact checksums
        ↓
dependency inventory
        ↓
software bill of materials
        ↓
signed artifacts
        ↓
signed release metadata
        ↓
verifiable attestations
```

The framework must allow these capabilities to be introduced incrementally.

No future provenance improvement should require fundamental redesign of the release model.

---

## Automation Vision

The long-term release process should minimize repetitive manual work.

Automation may eventually perform:

* release preparation;
* release branch verification;
* version validation;
* version calculation;
* changelog generation;
* release note preparation;
* artifact inventory generation;
* provenance collection;
* readiness evaluation;
* candidate creation;
* candidate validation;
* tag creation;
* release publication;
* artifact upload;
* release evidence storage;
* post-release verification.

Automation must remain subordinate to the release model and governance rules.

---

## Human Decision Vision

Automation should not eliminate meaningful human decisions.

The long-term architecture should separate:

```text
objective verification
```

from:

```text
governance judgment
```

Examples of objective verification include:

* repository cleanliness;
* test completion;
* artifact checksum verification;
* version syntax;
* tag uniqueness;
* required file existence.

Examples of governance judgment may include:

* accepting known risk;
* approving a major release;
* authorizing emergency publication;
* approving policy exceptions.

This separation improves both safety and accountability.

---

## CI/CD Vision

CI/CD should become an implementation mechanism for the Release Framework.

The framework must avoid defining release behavior solely through pipeline configuration.

The desired relationship is:

```text
Release Policy
      ↓
Release Architecture
      ↓
Release Workflow
      ↓
CI/CD Implementation
```

not:

```text
CI/CD Script
      ↓
Implicit Release Policy
```

This distinction protects the release model from tool lock-in and undocumented behavior.

---

## Publishing Vision

Publication should become an atomic or transactionally controlled process wherever possible.

The release system should avoid ambiguous states where only part of a release is officially available.

When perfect atomicity is technically impossible, the workflow must:

* detect partial completion;
* preserve state;
* prevent silent success;
* provide recovery procedures.

Publication must be verifiable.

A workflow should not consider a release complete merely because an upload command returned successfully.

---

## Distribution Vision

FamilyOS release engineering must distinguish between publication and distribution.

A release may be published into an authoritative registry or repository before being distributed to all consumers.

This enables controlled models such as:

```text
publish
   ↓
verify
   ↓
promote
   ↓
distribute
```

Future release channels may use this distinction to support staged availability.

---

## Release Channel Vision

Release channels should communicate stability and intended consumption.

A future channel model may include:

```text
development
preview
candidate
stable
maintenance
```

Promotion between channels should occur through controlled release transitions.

A channel must never become an alternative versioning system with unclear semantics.

---

## Progressive Delivery Vision

The framework should remain compatible with future progressive delivery mechanisms.

Potential future capabilities include:

* staged rollout;
* limited preview distribution;
* canary delivery;
* controlled plugin availability;
* environment-based release promotion;
* compatibility-based targeting.

EPIC-REL-001 does not require immediate implementation of progressive delivery.

It ensures that the release architecture does not prevent it.

---

## Rollback Vision

Rollback should become an explicit release capability rather than an emergency improvisation.

For every significant release class, the platform should understand:

* whether rollback is technically possible;
* which previous release is the rollback target;
* which state must be restored;
* whether data compatibility allows reversal;
* which artifacts must be republished;
* which verification is required after rollback.

Rollback should be tested where its reliability is operationally important.

---

## Forward Recovery Vision

Some release failures cannot safely be solved through rollback.

FamilyOS must therefore support forward recovery.

A forward-recovery workflow may involve:

```text
detect defect
    ↓
contain impact
    ↓
prepare correction
    ↓
accelerated validation
    ↓
new release identity
    ↓
publish corrective release
    ↓
supersede defective release
```

The Release Framework must treat this as a normal recovery strategy.

---

## Security Vision

The release pipeline should eventually be treated as a protected software supply-chain boundary.

The maturity target includes strong controls around:

* branch protection;
* release permissions;
* release credentials;
* artifact storage;
* artifact signing;
* provenance;
* CI/CD execution;
* tag integrity;
* publication authority;
* dependency integrity.

Highly privileged release operations should be minimized and auditable.

---

## Credential Vision

Release credentials must not become embedded in source code, scripts, or documentation.

The release architecture should support:

* short-lived credentials;
* scoped permissions;
* environment isolation;
* secret management;
* credential rotation;
* least privilege.

Automation should receive only the permissions necessary for its release responsibilities.

---

## Observability Vision

A mature release should generate an event trail that allows the full workflow to be reconstructed.

Conceptually:

```text
release.requested
release.prepared
release.readiness.started
release.readiness.passed
release.candidate.created
release.validation.started
release.validation.passed
release.approved
release.version.assigned
release.tag.created
release.publication.started
release.published
release.distribution.started
release.distributed
release.verified
release.completed
```

Failure events must be equally visible.

The specific telemetry implementation may evolve.

The lifecycle semantics must remain stable.

---

## Release History Vision

FamilyOS should eventually maintain a coherent historical release record.

For every official release, it should be possible to determine:

```text
identity
version
date
source state
artifact set
release type
release channel
changes
validation status
approval status
publication status
known issues
supersession state
```

Release history must remain useful even after tools and infrastructure change.

---

## Changelog Vision

The FamilyOS changelog model should be consistent and automation-friendly.

Changes should eventually be classifiable by meaningful categories such as:

* added;
* changed;
* fixed;
* deprecated;
* removed;
* security;
* compatibility.

The release process should be able to transform structured change information into release-specific communication.

---

## Release Notes Vision

Release notes should become a deliberate product of the release lifecycle.

They should provide enough information for maintainers and consumers to understand:

* what changed;
* why the release exists;
* compatibility impact;
* migration requirements;
* known limitations;
* security implications;
* upgrade considerations;
* rollback considerations where relevant.

Release notes must describe the actual release candidate, not an earlier planned state.

---

## Compatibility Vision

As FamilyOS grows, releases must communicate compatibility explicitly.

Compatibility domains may include:

```text
platform ↔ plugin
platform ↔ CLI
plugin ↔ plugin
API ↔ client
schema ↔ data
specification ↔ implementation
```

The Release Framework must integrate compatibility evidence where release decisions depend on it.

---

## Governance Vision

Release governance should become policy-driven.

The long-term objective is that release authority and release gates are defined independently of individual maintainers.

Governance should answer:

```text
Who may request a release?

Who may approve it?

Which gates are mandatory?

Which releases require additional approval?

Who may accept risk?

Who may authorize emergency release?

Who may withdraw a release?

Who may change the Release Framework?
```

These responsibilities must be explicit and reviewable.

---

## Exception Vision

Exceptional releases must remain governed.

The framework should support documented exceptions without allowing exceptions to silently become the default process.

An exception should identify:

* requirement being bypassed;
* reason;
* risk;
* authority;
* compensating controls;
* expiration or scope.

This allows operational flexibility without sacrificing accountability.

---

## Emergency Release Vision

Emergency release procedures should eventually provide a predefined accelerated path.

The target principle is:

> Faster does not mean uncontrolled.

Emergency releases may reduce coordination or planning stages.

They must retain minimum requirements for:

* identity;
* source traceability;
* validation;
* approval;
* documentation;
* security;
* publication verification;
* recovery.

---

## Compliance Vision

Release compliance should become increasingly automated.

A future release gate should be able to evaluate applicable release rules and produce structured findings.

Conceptually:

```text
Release Candidate
        ↓
Compliance Evaluation
        ↓
PASS
or
BLOCK
or
EXCEPTION REQUIRED
```

This should integrate with the broader FamilyOS Plugin Compliance and governance architecture where appropriate.

---

## Metrics Vision

Release metrics should help FamilyOS improve release reliability.

Potential future indicators include:

* release lead time;
* candidate failure rate;
* release frequency;
* publication failure rate;
* rollback frequency;
* recovery time;
* emergency release frequency;
* automated validation coverage;
* evidence completeness;
* release preparation effort.

Metrics should provide operational insight without incentivizing unsafe release behavior.

---

## Risk-Based Release Vision

The Release Framework should progressively adopt risk-based controls.

Not every release requires identical ceremony.

For example:

```text
documentation-only patch
```

may require less qualification than:

```text
major platform release
```

or:

```text
security-sensitive plugin release
```

The framework should allow validation and approval requirements to scale according to release risk while preserving core invariants.

---

## Release Profiles Vision

Future FamilyOS maturity may introduce reusable release profiles.

Examples may include:

```text
documentation-release
framework-release
plugin-release
platform-release
security-release
emergency-release
```

Each profile could define:

* required evidence;
* mandatory gates;
* approval policy;
* artifact types;
* release notes requirements;
* publication targets;
* recovery expectations.

Profiles must extend the common Release Framework rather than fragment it.

---

## Policy-as-Code Vision

Where practical, release policies should eventually become machine-evaluable.

Potential examples include:

```text
working_tree_clean == true
branch_synced == true
tests.status == pass
quality.status == pass
version.valid == true
tag.exists == false
release_notes.present == true
```

Policy-as-code should reinforce documented governance.

It must not create opaque rules that exist only inside automation.

---

## Release Orchestration Vision

At higher maturity levels, FamilyOS may introduce a dedicated release orchestration layer.

The orchestrator could coordinate:

```text
repository state
build evidence
testing evidence
quality evidence
compliance evidence
candidate creation
approval
versioning
tagging
publishing
verification
release evidence
```

Such orchestration must emerge from this framework rather than replace it.

---

## Tool Independence

The Release Framework must remain independent from specific providers.

The architecture must not depend fundamentally on:

* GitHub;
* GitLab;
* a specific CI/CD engine;
* a specific artifact registry;
* a particular package manager;
* a specific cloud provider.

FamilyOS may use these systems as implementations.

Release semantics must remain portable.

---

## Repository Independence

FamilyOS currently relies heavily on Git repository state for release traceability.

The framework should preserve Git as a strong release anchor while avoiding unnecessary assumptions that every future releasable asset must use exactly one repository topology.

The release model must support:

* monorepository components;
* independently versioned components;
* potentially multiple repositories in future evolution.

---

## Release Data Model Vision

The Release Framework should eventually support an explicit release domain model.

Possible entities include:

```text
Release
ReleaseCandidate
ReleaseVersion
ReleaseArtifact
ReleaseEvidence
ReleaseApproval
ReleaseChannel
ReleasePolicy
ReleasePublication
ReleaseRecovery
```

These entities may later become implementation models in FamilyOS tooling.

EPIC-REL-001 establishes their conceptual foundations first.

---

## CLI Vision

FamilyOS release engineering may eventually expose CLI capabilities.

A conceptual future interface could include operations such as:

```text
familyos release prepare
familyos release check
familyos release candidate
familyos release validate
familyos release approve
familyos release publish
familyos release verify
familyos release rollback
familyos release inspect
```

These commands are illustrative rather than immediate implementation requirements.

The Release Framework must be mature enough that such tooling can be implemented without embedding undocumented release logic.

---

## Machine-Readable Release Metadata

Future releases should expose machine-readable metadata.

This metadata may enable:

* automated compatibility checks;
* artifact verification;
* release discovery;
* upgrade tooling;
* dependency resolution;
* compliance verification;
* historical analysis.

Human-readable release notes and machine-readable release metadata should complement one another.

---

## Release Integrity Vision

The ultimate integrity objective is to create a verifiable chain:

```text
Trusted Source State
        ↓
Trusted Build
        ↓
Verified Artifact
        ↓
Validated Candidate
        ↓
Approved Release
        ↓
Protected Release Identity
        ↓
Verified Publication
        ↓
Trusted Distribution
```

Weakness in any link reduces confidence in the final release.

---

## Framework Evolution Vision

EPIC-REL-001 itself must evolve through controlled versions.

The framework should support future changes in:

* release architecture;
* release state models;
* versioning;
* automation;
* security controls;
* governance;
* compliance;
* distribution technology.

Changes to normative release behavior must be documented and versioned.

The Release Framework must apply its own release discipline to its evolution.

---

## Maturity Strategy

The vision is intentionally progressive.

FamilyOS should not attempt to implement all release capabilities simultaneously.

A suggested maturity progression is:

```text
Stage 1
Canonical release documentation

Stage 2
Standardized manual release workflow

Stage 3
Automated repository and readiness checks

Stage 4
Structured release evidence

Stage 5
Automated candidate preparation

Stage 6
Controlled automated publication

Stage 7
Artifact signing and advanced provenance

Stage 8
Policy-driven release orchestration

Stage 9
Risk-based release profiles

Stage 10
Fully observable release platform
```

Each stage builds upon the previous one.

---

## Non-Goals of the Vision

The Release Framework vision does not require:

* immediate fully automated publishing;
* elimination of all manual approvals;
* immediate artifact signing;
* immediate multi-registry distribution;
* immediate progressive delivery;
* immediate support for every possible release target;
* replacement of existing FamilyOS frameworks;
* coupling release semantics to a specific external platform.

The framework defines the destination and the architectural path.

Implementation may progress incrementally.

---

## Vision Invariants

The long-term architecture must preserve the following invariants.

### V1 — Release identity remains unambiguous.

### V2 — Source-to-release traceability remains possible.

### V3 — Validation refers to the actual candidate.

### V4 — Published release identity remains stable.

### V5 — Release authority remains explicit.

### V6 — Release failures remain observable.

### V7 — Recovery remains part of release design.

### V8 — Security remains integrated throughout the lifecycle.

### V9 — Automation remains governed.

### V10 — Release semantics remain independent from implementation tools.

### V11 — Historical releases remain reconstructable.

### V12 — Framework evolution remains controlled.

---

## Target Engineering Experience

The long-term developer and maintainer experience should be simple even though the release architecture is rigorous.

An authorized maintainer should eventually be able to initiate a release process and receive an explicit assessment such as:

```text
FamilyOS Release Readiness

Repository State        PASS
Build                    PASS
Tests                    PASS
Quality                  PASS
Compliance               PASS
Security                 PASS
Documentation            PASS
Artifacts                PASS
Version                  PASS
Release Notes            PASS
Risk                     ACCEPTABLE

Candidate: vX.Y.Z-rc.1

RELEASE READY
```

After approval, the platform should execute controlled publication and provide a final state such as:

```text
Release vX.Y.Z

Source Revision          VERIFIED
Release Tag              CREATED
Artifacts                PUBLISHED
Release Notes            PUBLISHED
Distribution             VERIFIED
Evidence                 RECORDED

RELEASE COMPLETE
```

The simplicity of the interface must come from strong architecture rather than hidden complexity.

---

## Target Consumer Experience

Consumers of FamilyOS releases should be able to determine:

* which release they are using;
* whether it is stable or pre-release;
* what changed;
* what platforms or plugins it supports;
* whether migration is required;
* whether known issues exist;
* whether a newer compatible release exists.

Release engineering must therefore support both internal engineering reliability and external release clarity.

---

## Target Maintainer Experience

Maintainers should no longer need to remember release procedures from previous terminal sessions.

The platform should provide:

* documented procedures;
* automated checks;
* explicit state;
* reliable evidence;
* reproducible operations;
* recovery instructions.

The release process should become transferable between qualified maintainers.

---

## Target Governance Experience

Governance should be able to answer:

```text
Which releases exist?

Which version is current?

Which release is stable?

Which candidate was approved?

Which exceptions were used?

Which release failed?

Which release superseded it?

Which artifacts belong to each release?
```

These questions should not require reconstructing fragmented terminal logs.

---

## Target Historical Experience

Years after a release, FamilyOS maintainers should still be able to understand it.

Historical release information should survive:

* contributor turnover;
* CI/CD platform changes;
* repository restructuring;
* tooling evolution.

This requires release history to be part of the platform's durable engineering record.

---

## Definition of the Future State

The Release Framework reaches its intended future state when release engineering becomes a reliable system rather than an individual procedure.

At that point:

```text
release preparation
release readiness
release candidate creation
release validation
release approval
versioning
tagging
publication
distribution
verification
recovery
```

are all explicit parts of a single governed architecture.

---

## Strategic Outcome

EPIC-REL-001 enables FamilyOS to move from:

```text
"We have completed the work and created a tag."
```

to:

```text
"This exact validated candidate has satisfied the applicable release policy,
has been assigned a controlled version,
is anchored to an immutable repository state,
has been published through an authorized release workflow,
and has sufficient evidence for verification and recovery."
```

This distinction represents the transition from manual release activity to mature release engineering.

---

## Final Vision

The ultimate vision of EPIC-REL-001 is a FamilyOS ecosystem in which releases are predictable engineering events.

A release should never depend on guesswork about:

* what was built;
* what was tested;
* what version applies;
* what commit was tagged;
* what artifact was published;
* who approved the operation;
* whether publication completed successfully.

Instead, release identity, evidence, state, authority, and history should be explicit and verifiable.

By establishing this foundation, the Release Framework enables FamilyOS to evolve confidently from a single engineering repository into a sustainable, extensible, and trustworthy software platform.
