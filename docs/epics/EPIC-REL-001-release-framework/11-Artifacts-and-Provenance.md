# Release Framework

## 11 Artifacts and Provenance

### Overview

EPIC-REL-001 — Release Framework defines the artifact and provenance model used to establish trust in FamilyOS releases.

A release is not defined only by a version number or Git tag.

It is also defined by the exact artifacts that belong to that release and by the evidence demonstrating where those artifacts came from.

The Artifacts and Provenance model establishes the relationship between:

* source revision;
* build execution;
* build outputs;
* release candidate;
* artifact identity;
* artifact integrity;
* release version;
* publication;
* historical reconstruction.

The objective is to ensure that FamilyOS can answer, for every significant official release:

> What exact artifacts were released, where did they come from, and how can their identity be verified?

---

## Purpose

This document establishes:

* release artifact identity;
* artifact inventory;
* artifact classification;
* artifact metadata;
* integrity verification;
* checksum expectations;
* provenance relationships;
* build-to-release traceability;
* artifact promotion;
* artifact immutability;
* artifact retention;
* release manifests;
* future signing and attestation capabilities;
* software supply-chain evolution.

The model provides the foundation for trustworthy candidate validation and publication.

---

## Artifact Principle

The central artifact principle is:

> A release must identify the exact artifacts that constitute it.

The following is insufficient:

```text
we released the latest package
```

A trustworthy release model requires:

```text
release identity
      ↓
artifact inventory
      ↓
artifact identity
      ↓
artifact provenance
      ↓
artifact integrity
```

---

## Provenance Principle

The central provenance principle is:

> Every release artifact should be traceable to the controlled engineering state that produced it.

The preferred chain is:

```text
Source Revision
      ↓
Build Definition
      ↓
Build Execution
      ↓
Build Artifact
      ↓
Release Candidate
      ↓
Validated Artifact
      ↓
Official Release
      ↓
Published Artifact
```

The strength of provenance evidence may increase as FamilyOS matures.

The conceptual chain must exist from the beginning.

---

## Artifact Definition

A Release Artifact is any immutable or versioned output intentionally included in an official release.

Examples may include:

* Python packages;
* binaries;
* source archives;
* plugin packages;
* container images;
* documentation bundles;
* schemas;
* generated metadata;
* release manifests;
* configuration packages;
* SDK archives;
* specification bundles.

Not every file generated during development is a release artifact.

---

## Build Artifact vs Release Artifact

Build artifacts and release artifacts are related but distinct.

A Build Artifact is produced by the Build Framework.

A Release Artifact is a build or prepared artifact selected for release.

Conceptually:

```text
Build Outputs
├── artifact A
├── artifact B
├── temporary artifact C
└── diagnostic artifact D

            ↓ selection

Release Artifact Set
├── artifact A
└── artifact B
```

The Release Framework owns the selection and qualification of release artifacts.

---

## Release Artifact Set

Every release involving artifacts SHOULD have an explicit artifact set.

Conceptually:

```text
ReleaseArtifactSet
├── artifact identifier
├── artifact type
├── artifact version
├── build identity
├── checksum
├── provenance
└── publication target
```

The artifact set must correspond to the release candidate.

---

## Artifact Inventory

A release artifact inventory lists all artifacts intended for publication.

Example:

```text
Release 5.2.0

Artifacts
├── familyos_cli-5.2.0-py3-none-any.whl
├── familyos-5.2.0.tar.gz
├── familyos-security-plugin-3.1.0.pkg
├── release-manifest.json
└── documentation-5.2.0.zip
```

The exact artifact types depend on release profile.

---

## Artifact Inventory Principle

A release MUST NOT publish unidentified artifacts.

Every published artifact should be expected by the release plan or explicitly approved during controlled release change.

Unexpected artifact presence is a release integrity concern.

---

## Artifact Classification

Artifacts may be classified by role.

Possible classes include:

```text
primary
supporting
metadata
documentation
provenance
debug
internal
```

Only appropriate artifact classes should be distributed publicly.

---

## Primary Artifacts

Primary artifacts represent the main consumable outputs of a release.

Examples:

* executable packages;
* libraries;
* plugins;
* container images;
* SDKs.

Primary artifacts require the strongest identity and integrity guarantees.

---

## Supporting Artifacts

Supporting artifacts help consumers use or verify a release.

Examples include:

* source archives;
* migration tools;
* compatibility files;
* configuration templates.

They remain part of release identity where officially distributed.

---

## Metadata Artifacts

Metadata artifacts describe the release.

Examples include:

* release manifest;
* artifact index;
* compatibility metadata;
* dependency metadata;
* checksums;
* signatures;
* provenance records.

Metadata should be treated as part of the release evidence model.

---

## Documentation Artifacts

Documentation may itself be released as an artifact.

Examples:

* HTML documentation bundle;
* PDF documentation;
* Markdown archive;
* API reference bundle.

Documentation artifacts should remain traceable to the release they describe.

---

## Artifact Identity

An artifact should have sufficient identity to distinguish it from other artifacts.

Artifact identity may include:

```text
component
artifact type
version
target platform
architecture
build identity
checksum
```

For example:

```text
component:
familyos-cli

version:
5.2.0

artifact:
wheel

checksum:
sha256:<digest>
```

---

## Filename Identity

Artifact filenames may communicate identity.

Example:

```text
familyos_cli-5.2.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

However, filenames alone are not sufficient evidence of artifact identity.

Files can be renamed.

Stronger identity should use metadata and integrity evidence.

---

## Artifact Version

Artifacts should expose or reference the release version where appropriate.

For independently versioned components, the component version must be explicit.

Example:

```text
Platform Release:
5.2.0

Finance Plugin:
3.0.1
```

The release manifest should preserve the relationship.

---

## Artifact Build Identity

Where artifacts originate from a build, they SHOULD identify or reference the build execution that produced them.

Example:

```text
Artifact:
familyos_cli-5.2.0.whl

Build:
ci-4921

Source:
abcdef123456
```

This creates direct source-to-artifact traceability.

---

## Artifact Checksum

FamilyOS SHOULD use cryptographic checksums for releasable binary or packaged artifacts where practical.

SHA-256 or an equivalently appropriate algorithm may be used.

Example:

```text
familyos_cli-5.2.0.whl
sha256:
8e4f...
```

The exact checksum algorithm may be governed by future security policy.

---

## Checksum Purpose

Checksums provide evidence that:

```text
artifact received
=
artifact identified by release evidence
```

They support:

* integrity verification;
* publication verification;
* artifact comparison;
* candidate-to-stable promotion;
* historical reconstruction.

---

## Checksum Limitations

A checksum proves content identity.

It does not by itself prove:

* who produced the artifact;
* whether the source was trusted;
* whether the build was authorized;
* whether the artifact is safe;
* whether the artifact passed validation.

Checksums are one part of provenance.

---

## Artifact Integrity

Artifact integrity means that the artifact has not been unintentionally or unauthorizedly altered relative to its recorded identity.

Integrity may be established progressively through:

```text
checksum
   ↓
signed checksum
   ↓
artifact signature
   ↓
signed provenance
   ↓
attestation
```

FamilyOS may adopt stronger mechanisms over time.

---

## Artifact Immutability

Published release artifacts SHOULD be immutable.

Once an artifact is published under an official release identity:

```text
version X
artifact checksum A
```

the same official identity should not later resolve to:

```text
version X
artifact checksum B
```

without an explicit governed correction model.

---

## Artifact Replacement

Silent artifact replacement is prohibited for official immutable releases.

The preferred correction strategy is:

```text
defective artifact
      ↓
withdraw / supersede
      ↓
new build
      ↓
new release version
      ↓
new artifact
```

This preserves historical trust.

---

## Artifact Promotion

The preferred release model promotes the same artifacts through qualification stages.

```text
Build
  ↓
Candidate Artifact
  ↓
Validate
  ↓
Approve
  ↓
Publish Same Artifact
```

This minimizes the gap between tested and published content.

---

## Artifact Promotion Invariant

Where possible:

```text
candidate checksum
=
published checksum
```

This is the strongest simple evidence that the validated artifact was the artifact published.

---

## Rebuilt Stable Artifacts

If stable release artifacts must be rebuilt after candidate validation, the new artifacts must not automatically inherit the candidate's validation status.

The release process must perform:

* equivalence verification;
* renewed provenance verification;
* renewed integrity checks;
* additional validation where necessary.

---

## Reproducible Build Relationship

The Build Framework may eventually provide reproducible artifacts.

Where supported, FamilyOS may compare:

```text
candidate artifact
```

against:

```text
independent rebuild
```

If outputs are identical, release confidence increases.

---

## Provenance Definition

Provenance is the evidence describing the origin and transformation history of an artifact.

A minimal provenance relationship is:

```text
artifact
  ↓
build
  ↓
source revision
```

A mature provenance record may include substantially more detail.

---

## Minimal Provenance

At minimum, significant release artifacts SHOULD be traceable to:

```text
release version
source revision
build identity
artifact identity
```

This establishes baseline release traceability.

---

## Extended Provenance

Extended provenance may include:

* repository;
* branch lineage;
* commit;
* build definition;
* build environment;
* compiler or interpreter;
* dependency versions;
* build timestamp;
* build agent;
* artifact checksum;
* build configuration;
* validation results.

---

## Provenance Chain

The canonical provenance chain is:

```text
Repository
   ↓
Source Revision
   ↓
Build Definition
   ↓
Build Execution
   ↓
Artifact
   ↓
Candidate
   ↓
Validation
   ↓
Release Version
   ↓
Publication
```

Each link should remain reconstructable at the maturity level required by governance.

---

## Source Provenance

Source provenance identifies where the release source came from.

Relevant information may include:

* repository identifier;
* commit;
* branch or lineage;
* tag where applicable;
* submodule state;
* source archive checksum.

The commit identity is normally the primary source anchor in Git-based workflows.

---

## Build Provenance

Build provenance describes how source became artifacts.

It may include:

```text
build ID
build definition version
toolchain version
dependency state
build environment
configuration
```

EPIC-BLD-001 governs build mechanics.

EPIC-REL-001 consumes this information as release provenance.

---

## Dependency Provenance

Dependencies can materially affect release artifacts.

Where appropriate, provenance should record:

* resolved dependency versions;
* lockfiles;
* package checksums;
* external component versions.

This supports software supply-chain analysis.

---

## Configuration Provenance

Release-relevant build configuration may affect artifacts.

Examples include:

* optimization level;
* target architecture;
* enabled features;
* plugin set;
* packaging configuration.

Material configuration must remain identifiable.

---

## Environment Provenance

Some release artifacts may depend on the build environment.

Relevant information may include:

* operating system;
* architecture;
* Python version;
* compiler version;
* container image;
* build runner image.

Reproducible environments reduce provenance ambiguity.

---

## Candidate Provenance

Release Candidate provenance binds the candidate to its artifact set.

Conceptually:

```text
Candidate 5.2.0-rc.2
├── source abc123
├── build ci-4921
├── artifact A checksum X
├── artifact B checksum Y
└── validation profile Z
```

This record becomes the basis of final release qualification.

---

## Release Provenance

Final release provenance binds:

```text
Official Release
      ↓
Final Candidate
      ↓
Validated Artifacts
      ↓
Build
      ↓
Source
```

A stable release should not lose the provenance information established during candidate qualification.

---

## Publication Provenance

Publication provenance records where and how release artifacts were published.

It may include:

* publication target;
* artifact location;
* version;
* upload timestamp;
* checksum verification;
* publishing actor or automation;
* publication result.

This supports post-release verification.

---

## Provenance Evidence

Provenance evidence may be stored in:

* release manifests;
* CI/CD artifacts;
* Git metadata;
* package metadata;
* registries;
* dedicated provenance records;
* future evidence stores.

The conceptual relationship is more important than immediate storage choice.

---

## Release Manifest

A future FamilyOS release may contain a release manifest describing the artifact set and provenance.

Illustrative example:

```text
release:
  version: 5.2.0
  source_revision: abc123

artifacts:
  - name: familyos_cli-5.2.0.whl
    sha256: ...
    build_id: ci-4921

  - name: familyos-5.2.0.tar.gz
    sha256: ...
    build_id: ci-4921
```

This is conceptual and not yet a mandatory schema.

---

## Manifest Authority

If a release manifest is introduced, governance must define whether it becomes:

* descriptive metadata;
* authoritative artifact inventory;
* provenance evidence;
* publication contract.

The role must not remain ambiguous.

---

## Artifact Inventory Validation

Before release approval, the artifact inventory should be verified.

Checks may include:

```text
expected artifact count
expected artifact names
expected artifact types
version consistency
checksum availability
build identity
unexpected artifact absence
unexpected artifact presence
```

---

## Artifact Completeness

A release must not be considered complete if mandatory artifacts are missing.

Example:

```text
Expected:
wheel
source archive
release manifest

Actual:
wheel
source archive

Result:
BLOCKED
```

---

## Unexpected Artifacts

Unexpected artifacts should trigger review.

Example:

```text
Expected:
2 artifacts

Found:
3 artifacts
```

The additional artifact may represent:

* build drift;
* accidental packaging;
* unwanted debug file;
* publication configuration error.

---

## Artifact Naming

Artifact names should be deterministic and descriptive where practical.

Naming may include:

* component;
* version;
* target;
* architecture;
* artifact type.

Names should avoid ambiguous identifiers such as:

```text
final.zip
latest.tar.gz
release-new.pkg
```

---

## Artifact Metadata

Release artifacts SHOULD expose enough metadata to identify their purpose and release relationship.

Metadata may include:

```text
name
version
component
artifact type
source revision
build ID
checksum
```

---

## Metadata Consistency

Artifact metadata must be consistent with:

* release version;
* candidate version;
* package version;
* release manifest;
* tag;
* release notes.

Conflicting version metadata is a release blocker.

---

## Artifact Storage

Release artifacts may be stored in:

* package registries;
* artifact registries;
* Git hosting releases;
* object storage;
* container registries;
* plugin registries.

Storage technology must not redefine artifact semantics.

---

## Artifact Retention

Retention policy should preserve official release artifacts for as long as required by support, governance, or reconstruction needs.

Temporary build artifacts may use shorter retention.

Official stable artifacts should generally have strong retention expectations.

---

## Artifact Deletion

Deleting an official historical artifact can damage release reproducibility and supportability.

Artifact deletion should therefore be governed.

Reasons may include:

* legal requirement;
* severe security issue;
* corrupted artifact;
* policy violation.

Deletion must preserve historical metadata where possible.

---

## Artifact Withdrawal

Withdrawal is generally preferable to silent deletion when an artifact should no longer be consumed.

A withdrawn artifact may remain identifiable while being removed from normal distribution.

---

## Provenance Retention

Provenance evidence should remain available for at least as long as the corresponding release remains relevant under FamilyOS governance.

A release without retained provenance becomes harder to verify over time.

---

## Software Bill of Materials

At higher maturity, FamilyOS MAY generate a Software Bill of Materials for applicable releases.

An SBOM may describe:

* included packages;
* versions;
* suppliers;
* dependency relationships;
* identifiers.

SBOM generation belongs to the evolution of release provenance.

---

## SBOM Relationship

An SBOM is part of provenance and supply-chain evidence.

It does not replace:

* build provenance;
* release manifest;
* artifact checksum;
* release validation.

It complements them.

---

## Artifact Signing

Future FamilyOS releases MAY use cryptographic artifact signing.

Signing may provide evidence that:

```text
artifact
was approved or produced
by a trusted signing identity
```

Signing policy must define:

* signing authority;
* key management;
* verification process;
* rotation;
* revocation.

---

## Signed Checksums

A simpler intermediate maturity step may be:

```text
artifact
   ↓
checksum
   ↓
signed checksum document
```

This can strengthen integrity without requiring every artifact format to support embedded signatures.

---

## Attestations

Future FamilyOS release infrastructure may generate signed attestations describing build or release claims.

Possible claims include:

* source revision;
* build system;
* artifact digest;
* validation status;
* publication authorization.

Attestation format is not defined by this EPIC.

---

## Provenance Standards

FamilyOS should remain compatible with evolving software supply-chain standards.

Potential future integrations may include:

* SLSA-style provenance;
* in-toto-style attestations;
* SPDX;
* CycloneDX;
* Sigstore-compatible signing.

Specific adoption requires separate architectural and security decisions.

---

## Provenance Trust

Provenance is only as trustworthy as the systems generating and protecting it.

A provenance file generated by an untrusted or mutable process provides limited assurance.

Future maturity must therefore consider:

```text
identity
authentication
authorization
signing
tamper resistance
```

for provenance generation.

---

## Artifact Trust Chain

The desired long-term trust chain is:

```text
Trusted Source
    ↓
Controlled Build
    ↓
Identified Artifact
    ↓
Verified Integrity
    ↓
Bound Candidate
    ↓
Release Validation
    ↓
Governed Approval
    ↓
Protected Publication
    ↓
Consumer Verification
```

---

## Consumer Verification

Future FamilyOS consumers should be able to verify release artifacts where appropriate.

Verification may include:

* version check;
* checksum validation;
* signature validation;
* provenance verification;
* registry identity verification.

This strengthens end-to-end release trust.

---

## Publication Verification

After publication, the release process should verify artifact integrity.

Example:

```text
local artifact checksum
        =
published artifact checksum
```

A publication system returning success is not sufficient if the published content cannot be confirmed.

---

## Multi-Target Publication

The same artifact may be published to multiple targets.

Example:

```text
Artifact A
├── Git hosting
├── package registry
└── mirror
```

Each target should preserve the same artifact identity where the target is intended to distribute the identical release object.

---

## Mirror Integrity

Mirrors or secondary distribution systems should not modify artifact contents under the same release identity.

If transformation occurs, the resulting object should be considered a distinct artifact with its own identity.

---

## Platform-Specific Artifacts

A release may contain different artifacts for different targets.

Example:

```text
familyos-5.2.0-linux-x86_64
familyos-5.2.0-macos-arm64
familyos-5.2.0-windows-x86_64
```

Each artifact requires independent integrity identity while belonging to the same release.

---

## Aggregate Release Provenance

A platform release may aggregate multiple independently versioned components.

Example:

```text
FamilyOS Platform 5.2.0
├── CLI 5.2.0
├── Finance Plugin 3.1.0
├── Security Plugin 4.0.2
└── Documentation 5.2.0
```

The platform release evidence should preserve these component identities.

---

## Plugin Artifact Provenance

Official plugin releases should be traceable through:

```text
plugin source
   ↓
plugin build
   ↓
plugin package
   ↓
plugin compliance
   ↓
plugin candidate
   ↓
plugin release
```

Plugin compliance evidence becomes part of the plugin release provenance context.

---

## Documentation Provenance

Documentation releases also require provenance.

A documentation artifact should remain traceable to:

* repository revision;
* documentation source;
* generation process where applicable;
* release version.

Generated documentation should not become detached from its source state.

---

## Specification Provenance

Versioned specifications should likewise identify:

* source revision;
* specification version;
* publication state.

This allows implementation compatibility to reference precise specification history.

---

## Artifact Evidence Record

A future artifact evidence record may contain:

```text
artifact:
  name
  type
  version
  checksum

source:
  repository
  revision

build:
  id
  environment

candidate:
  id

publication:
  target
  verified
```

The schema is illustrative.

---

## Provenance Validation

Release validation should verify provenance consistency.

Checks may include:

```text
artifact source matches candidate source
artifact build matches recorded build
artifact version matches release intent
artifact checksum matches candidate record
artifact inventory matches release manifest
```

---

## Provenance Failure

A provenance inconsistency is a release blocker unless explicitly governed and safely resolved.

Examples include:

* artifact cannot be mapped to source;
* checksum differs unexpectedly;
* package version differs from release version;
* artifact originated from unknown build;
* candidate references wrong commit.

---

## Missing Provenance

The severity of missing provenance depends on release profile.

A local development release may tolerate minimal metadata.

A stable platform release should require stronger provenance.

A high-risk security release may require stronger controls still.

---

## Provenance Maturity Model

FamilyOS may evolve through:

```text
Level 1
source commit recorded

Level 2
build ID recorded

Level 3
artifact checksums recorded

Level 4
release manifest generated

Level 5
dependency inventory / SBOM

Level 6
artifact signatures

Level 7
signed provenance

Level 8
verifiable attestations
```

Each level strengthens the same underlying provenance model.

---

## Artifact Lifecycle

A release artifact may progress through states such as:

```text
BUILT
   ↓
SELECTED
   ↓
CANDIDATE
   ↓
VALIDATED
   ↓
APPROVED
   ↓
PUBLISHED
   ↓
DISTRIBUTED
```

Exceptional states may include:

```text
REJECTED
WITHDRAWN
SUPERSEDED
```

Artifact state should align with release lifecycle.

---

## Artifact Promotion Record

Promotion should preserve:

* artifact digest;
* source release state;
* destination channel;
* timestamp;
* validation evidence;
* approval.

This enables channel history reconstruction.

---

## Artifact Rollback

Rollback should generally select a previously valid artifact rather than mutate a defective one.

Example:

```text
stable → artifact B
problem
stable → artifact A
```

Both artifacts remain historically identifiable.

---

## Artifact Recovery

When publication fails, recovery should use artifact evidence to determine:

* which artifacts were uploaded;
* which target versions exist;
* which digests were published;
* whether cleanup is safe;
* whether retry is idempotent.

---

## Artifact Idempotency

Publication tooling should identify already-published artifacts safely.

Example:

```text
artifact already exists

checksum matches
→ continue / verify

checksum differs
→ BLOCK
```

Silent overwrite is prohibited.

---

## Artifact Collision

If a publication target already contains:

```text
version 5.2.0
checksum X
```

and the current release attempts to publish:

```text
version 5.2.0
checksum Y
```

the release MUST block.

This indicates release identity collision.

---

## Artifact Authorization

Not every actor capable of producing an artifact should be capable of publishing it.

Artifact generation and artifact publication permissions should be separable.

This supports least privilege.

---

## Provenance Authorization

Provenance generation should be performed by systems whose identity and trust level are appropriate for the release profile.

Highly sensitive release evidence should not rely solely on unverified local metadata.

---

## Local vs Authoritative Provenance

Local provenance may assist development.

Authoritative release provenance should originate from or be verified by controlled release systems where practical.

The distinction becomes more important as release assurance increases.

---

## Release Evidence Integration

Artifact and provenance evidence should integrate with the broader Release Evidence model.

Conceptually:

```text
Release Evidence
├── Source Evidence
├── Build Evidence
├── Test Evidence
├── Quality Evidence
├── Artifact Evidence
├── Provenance Evidence
├── Approval Evidence
└── Publication Evidence
```

---

## Artifact Metrics

Future FamilyOS metrics may include:

* artifact verification failures;
* provenance completeness;
* checksum mismatch count;
* rebuild equivalence rate;
* artifact publication failures;
* artifact retention coverage.

Metrics should improve release trust.

---

## Artifact and Provenance Invariants

The following invariants apply.

### AP1 — Every significant published release artifact has explicit identity.

### AP2 — Release artifact sets are known and reviewable.

### AP3 — Release artifacts are traceable to controlled source state.

### AP4 — Build identity is preserved where applicable.

### AP5 — Artifact integrity is verifiable where practical.

### AP6 — Candidate artifacts remain stable during final validation.

### AP7 — Published artifacts are not silently replaced.

### AP8 — Artifact version metadata is consistent with release identity.

### AP9 — Publication preserves artifact identity.

### AP10 — Provenance remains available for historical reconstruction.

### AP11 — Artifact promotion should reuse validated artifacts where practical.

### AP12 — Stronger provenance mechanisms may be added without changing release semantics.

---

## Artifact Anti-Patterns

### Latest Artifact Release

Publishing whichever build artifact happens to be newest.

---

### Filename Trust

Assuming an artifact is valid because its filename contains the expected version.

---

### Mutable Package

Replacing a package under an existing official version.

---

### Lost Build Identity

Publishing an artifact without knowing which build produced it.

---

### Lost Source Identity

Publishing an artifact that cannot be tied to a controlled source revision.

---

### Rebuild After Validation

Validating one artifact and publishing another without equivalence verification.

---

### Checksum-Free Multi-Step Publication

Publishing important binary artifacts to multiple targets without a reliable way to confirm content equality.

---

### Manifest Drift

Allowing release manifests to list artifacts different from the actual published set.

---

### Provenance as Decoration

Generating provenance files that are not tied to artifact identity or release decisions.

---

## Minimum Artifact Model

At minimum, a stable FamilyOS release involving packaged artifacts should know:

```text
release version
artifact names
artifact versions
source revision
build identity where applicable
artifact checksums where practical
publication targets
```

This provides a usable baseline.

---

## Framework Release Artifact Model

A documentation framework release may have no traditional compiled package.

Its primary released object may be the committed repository state itself.

For such releases, artifact identity may be represented by:

```text
repository
commit
tag
document set
```

For example:

```text
EPIC-REL-001
      ↓
Git commit
      ↓
v4.8.0-release-framework
```

The release provenance remains meaningful even without a binary package.

---

## Current FamilyOS Framework Provenance

For current framework releases, the practical provenance chain is:

```text
FamilyOS Repository
        ↓
feature/foundation-engineering-docs
        ↓
specific commit
        ↓
framework documentation state
        ↓
annotated release tag
        ↓
authoritative remote
```

This represents an initial provenance implementation compatible with the broader architecture.

---

## Target Artifact Experience

At higher maturity, a maintainer should be able to inspect a release and see:

```text
FamilyOS Release 5.2.0

Source Revision
abcdef123456      VERIFIED

Build
ci-4921           VERIFIED

Artifacts
4                 VERIFIED

familyos_cli-5.2.0.whl
sha256: ...       VERIFIED

familyos-5.2.0.tar.gz
sha256: ...       VERIFIED

release-manifest.json
sha256: ...       VERIFIED

documentation-5.2.0.zip
sha256: ...       VERIFIED

Candidate
5.2.0-rc.3        VALIDATED

Provenance
COMPLETE
```

---

## Target Consumer Experience

A consumer should eventually be able to determine:

```text
Which artifact belongs to this release?

Is its checksum valid?

Which source revision produced it?

Is it an official FamilyOS artifact?

Was it published through the official release process?
```

The framework should progressively make these questions easier to answer.

---

## Relationship With Build Framework

EPIC-BLD-001 defines artifact generation.

This document defines how those artifacts become release identities and how their origin remains traceable.

## Relationship With Release Candidates

`10-Release-Candidates.md` binds the selected artifact set to a formal candidate.

This document defines the identity and provenance of those artifacts.

---

## Relationship With Release Validation

`12-Release-Validation.md` verifies artifact integrity and provenance before approval.

---

## Relationship With Release Security

`19-Release-Security.md` defines stronger security requirements for:

* artifact integrity;
* signing;
* credentials;
* supply-chain trust;
* provenance protection.

---

## Relationship With Publishing and Distribution

`17-Publishing-and-Distribution.md` governs movement of release artifacts into authoritative publication and consumer distribution systems.

Artifact identity must survive that transition.

---

## Relationship With Release Observability

`20-Release-Observability.md` defines how artifact publication and provenance status become observable.

---

## Final Statement

The FamilyOS Artifacts and Provenance model establishes the chain of trust connecting source code to official release outputs.

It ensures that FamilyOS does not release anonymous, ambiguous, or mutable artifacts.

By defining artifact inventory, identity, integrity, build relationships, candidate binding, provenance, promotion, retention, and future signing and attestation capabilities, the Release Framework creates the foundation required for trustworthy software supply-chain evolution.

A FamilyOS release must ultimately be able to prove not only which version was published, but also which exact artifacts constituted that version and how those artifacts originated from the controlled engineering state that produced them.
