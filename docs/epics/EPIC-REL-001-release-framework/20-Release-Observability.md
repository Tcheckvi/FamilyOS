# Release Framework

## 20 Release Observability

### Overview

Release observability is the capability to understand the state, behavior, impact, and outcome of a FamilyOS release throughout its lifecycle.

A release does not end when deployment completes.

After deployment, the platform must provide sufficient evidence to determine whether the released version is operating correctly, whether expected behavior has been preserved, whether new risks have appeared, and whether recovery actions may be required.

Release observability connects release engineering with runtime evidence.

It provides the information required to answer fundamental questions:

* What version is currently running?
* Where is it running?
* When was it deployed?
* Which artifacts were deployed?
* Which configuration is active?
* Is the release healthy?
* Did error rates change?
* Did performance change?
* Are critical workflows operating normally?
* Are dependencies healthy?
* Did security behavior change?
* Are users experiencing regressions?
* Should the release continue, pause, roll back, or recover?

The governing principle is:

> A release that cannot be observed cannot be confidently declared successful.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of release observability is to establish a consistent model for collecting, correlating, interpreting, and preserving runtime evidence associated with FamilyOS releases.

The framework defines requirements for:

* release identification;
* deployment visibility;
* runtime health monitoring;
* release-specific telemetry;
* metrics;
* logs;
* traces;
* events;
* alerts;
* deployment markers;
* version correlation;
* configuration correlation;
* dependency visibility;
* plugin visibility;
* security signals;
* release verification;
* anomaly detection;
* rollback decision support;
* recovery verification;
* release evidence.

Release observability transforms production behavior into actionable release information.

---

## Release Observability Principle

General system observability answers:

> What is happening in the platform?

Release observability adds another question:

> How is the current release influencing what is happening in the platform?

This distinction is essential.

A monitoring system may report an increase in errors.

Release observability must make it possible to determine whether those errors correlate with:

* a specific release;
* a specific artifact;
* a specific deployment;
* a configuration change;
* a migration;
* a plugin update;
* a dependency change;
* a feature activation.

The basic model is:

```text
Release
   |
   v
Deployment
   |
   v
Runtime
   |
   +----------+----------+----------+----------+
   |          |          |          |          |
   v          v          v          v          v
 Metrics     Logs       Traces     Events     Alerts
   |          |          |          |          |
   +----------+----------+----------+----------+
                         |
                         v
                Release Correlation
                         |
                         v
                 Release Assessment
```

Observability must connect runtime signals back to release identity.

---

## Objectives

Release observability must support several operational objectives.

### Visibility

The active release state must be visible.

### Correlation

Runtime behavior must be correlatable with release changes.

### Detection

Release-related failures must be detected quickly.

### Diagnosis

Observability data must help determine why a release is failing.

### Verification

Release success must be supported by runtime evidence.

### Recovery

Rollback and recovery decisions must be informed by reliable signals.

### Traceability

Release events and significant runtime observations must remain traceable.

### Improvement

Historical release telemetry must support continuous improvement.

---

## Observability Across the Release Lifecycle

Observability must exist throughout the release lifecycle.

```text
Release Candidate
      |
      v
Pre-Deployment Baseline
      |
      v
Deployment Start
      |
      v
Deployment Observation
      |
      v
Post-Deployment Verification
      |
      v
Stabilization Window
      |
      v
Release Acceptance
      |
      v
Continuous Runtime Observation
```

Each stage provides different evidence.

Observability must therefore begin before deployment rather than after a problem occurs.

---

## Pre-Deployment Baseline

Release evaluation requires a reference point.

Before significant production deployment, relevant baseline measurements should be available.

The baseline may include:

* request rates;
* error rates;
* latency;
* resource utilization;
* service availability;
* dependency health;
* critical workflow success rates;
* background job behavior;
* security signals;
* plugin health;
* queue depth;
* storage behavior.

The purpose is not to capture every possible metric.

The purpose is to understand normal behavior well enough to identify meaningful release-related changes.

---

## Release Identity

Every observable release must have a stable identity.

Release identity should include appropriate metadata such as:

```text
release_id
release_version
commit_sha
artifact_id
artifact_digest
build_id
deployment_id
environment
deployment_timestamp
```

Where applicable, additional metadata may include:

```text
configuration_version
schema_version
plugin_versions
dependency_versions
feature_state
```

This metadata enables runtime evidence to be associated with the exact release state.

---

## Version Visibility

The currently running FamilyOS version must be discoverable through approved operational mechanisms.

Depending on the architecture, version information may be exposed through:

* health endpoints;
* diagnostic endpoints;
* CLI commands;
* runtime metadata;
* deployment platforms;
* logs;
* metrics;
* service metadata.

Version visibility must not expose sensitive internal information unnecessarily.

The objective is operational identification, not unrestricted disclosure.

---

## Deployment Markers

Every production deployment should create an observable deployment marker.

A deployment marker identifies when a release change entered the environment.

Example:

```text
2026-08-10T12:00:00Z
deployment_id=prod-20260810-001
release_version=v4.8.0
commit_sha=abc123
environment=production
status=started
```

A corresponding completion marker should record the deployment result.

Deployment markers allow operational signals before and after the release to be compared accurately.

---

## Deployment Timeline

The release system should maintain a deployment timeline.

A timeline may contain:

```text
Release Approved
      |
      v
Deployment Started
      |
      v
Artifact Activated
      |
      v
Health Checks Started
      |
      v
Verification Started
      |
      v
Verification Passed
      |
      v
Stabilization Window
      |
      v
Release Accepted
```

Failure events must also appear in the timeline.

This creates a coherent operational history of the release.

---

## Observability Signals

FamilyOS release observability is built from several signal categories.

The primary signals are:

```text
Metrics
Logs
Traces
Events
Alerts
Health Signals
Release Metadata
```

No single signal is sufficient for every release scenario.

Signals should complement one another.

---

## Metrics

Metrics provide quantitative information about runtime behavior.

Release-relevant metrics may include:

* availability;
* request volume;
* success rate;
* error rate;
* latency;
* CPU utilization;
* memory utilization;
* storage utilization;
* queue depth;
* job success rate;
* retry rate;
* timeout rate;
* dependency failures;
* plugin failures;
* authentication failures;
* authorization failures.

Metrics should be tagged or otherwise correlated with relevant release identity where practical.

---

## Release Health Metrics

Release health metrics should focus on whether the deployed release behaves within acceptable operational boundaries.

Examples include:

```text
release_request_success_rate
release_error_rate
release_latency_p95
release_latency_p99
release_health_check_success
release_dependency_failure_rate
release_plugin_failure_rate
```

Metric naming is implementation-specific.

The conceptual requirement is consistent release-level visibility.

---

## Logs

Logs provide detailed event and diagnostic information.

Release-relevant logs should include sufficient context to identify:

* service;
* environment;
* release version;
* deployment;
* component;
* severity;
* timestamp;
* operation or request context.

Where practical, structured logging should be preferred.

Example:

```text
{
  "timestamp": "2026-08-10T12:05:10Z",
  "level": "ERROR",
  "service": "familyos-runtime",
  "release_version": "v4.8.0",
  "deployment_id": "prod-20260810-001",
  "event": "plugin_initialization_failed"
}
```

Sensitive information must not be logged.

---

## Traceability Through Logs

Release logs should make it possible to reconstruct significant release events.

Examples include:

* deployment start;
* deployment completion;
* migration start;
* migration completion;
* configuration activation;
* feature activation;
* health verification;
* rollback initiation;
* rollback completion;
* recovery verification.

Operational logs must complement formal release evidence.

---

## Distributed Tracing

Where FamilyOS components participate in distributed request flows, tracing can provide release-level diagnostic value.

Tracing can help identify:

* latency introduced by a release;
* failing service boundaries;
* dependency bottlenecks;
* plugin execution failures;
* downstream regressions;
* unexpected call patterns.

Trace metadata should include release identity where technically appropriate.

This allows traces from different release versions to be compared.

---

## Events

Release events represent significant lifecycle transitions.

Examples include:

```text
release.approved
release.deployment.started
release.deployment.completed
release.verification.started
release.verification.failed
release.verification.passed
release.rollback.started
release.rollback.completed
release.recovery.completed
release.accepted
```

Event names are illustrative.

The implementation may use different naming conventions while preserving equivalent semantics.

---

## Health Signals

Health checks provide immediate information about whether deployed components can operate.

Health signals may include:

* process health;
* service readiness;
* dependency connectivity;
* database connectivity;
* queue connectivity;
* plugin initialization;
* required configuration availability.

Health checks should distinguish between different operational states where appropriate.

For example:

```text
STARTING
READY
DEGRADED
UNHEALTHY
```

Binary health models may be insufficient for complex systems.

---

## Liveness and Readiness

Liveness and readiness must not be treated as identical concepts.

### Liveness

Liveness answers:

> Is the component running?

### Readiness

Readiness answers:

> Is the component capable of safely serving its intended workload?

A release may be alive but not ready.

Release verification should therefore prefer readiness-oriented evidence when determining deployment success.

---

## Dependency Observability

A release may appear healthy while one of its dependencies is degraded.

Release observability must therefore include critical dependency visibility.

Relevant dependencies may include:

* databases;
* caches;
* message systems;
* external APIs;
* identity providers;
* storage systems;
* plugin dependencies;
* platform services.

Dependency telemetry should help distinguish:

```text
Release Failure
```

from:

```text
External Dependency Failure
```

This distinction directly affects rollback decisions.

---

## Plugin Observability

FamilyOS is a plugin-oriented platform.

Release observability must therefore provide visibility into plugin state.

Relevant signals may include:

* plugin version;
* plugin activation state;
* initialization status;
* capability registration;
* contribution registration;
* execution failures;
* dependency failures;
* policy failures;
* plugin latency.

Plugin telemetry should allow failures to be isolated without incorrectly attributing all failures to the FamilyOS core runtime.

---

## Configuration Observability

Configuration changes can alter runtime behavior without changing application artifacts.

Release observability should therefore identify the active configuration baseline.

Relevant metadata may include:

```text
configuration_version
configuration_digest
configuration_activation_time
environment
```

Secrets must never be exposed as observability metadata.

Only identifiers, versions, hashes, or other safe references should be used.

---

## Feature Flag Observability

When feature flags are used, the active feature state becomes part of the effective release state.

Observability should therefore record significant feature activation changes.

Example:

```text
release_version=v4.8.0
feature=new_plugin_loader
state=enabled
environment=production
```

This makes it possible to distinguish failures caused by deployment from failures caused by later feature activation.

---

## Migration Observability

Database and state migrations must produce observable lifecycle signals.

At minimum, significant migrations should expose:

* migration identifier;
* migration version;
* start time;
* completion time;
* result;
* failure status.

Where appropriate, additional information may include:

* records processed;
* records failed;
* duration;
* recovery state.

Migration observability is especially important because migration failures may alter rollback feasibility.

---

## Security Observability

Release observability must integrate security-relevant signals.

Potential release-related security signals include:

* authentication failure increases;
* authorization failure increases;
* unexpected privilege errors;
* security policy violations;
* signature verification failures;
* integrity verification failures;
* abnormal secret access;
* dependency security failures.

Security telemetry must follow FamilyOS security and privacy requirements.

Observability must not itself create a security vulnerability.

---

## Privacy and Data Protection

Observability systems may process sensitive operational information.

FamilyOS must therefore apply data protection principles to observability.

Telemetry must avoid unnecessary collection of:

* personal data;
* credentials;
* authentication tokens;
* secrets;
* private document content;
* sensitive domain data.

Observability data collection must be proportional to operational need.

Sensitive values must be:

* omitted;
* masked;
* redacted;
* tokenized;
* otherwise protected.

---

## Release Dashboards

Release dashboards should provide a concise operational view of the active release.

A release dashboard may include:

```text
Release Version
Deployment Status
Deployment Time
Environment
Health Status
Error Rate
Latency
Critical Workflow Status
Dependency Status
Plugin Status
Active Alerts
Rollback Status
```

Dashboards should support decision-making rather than merely display large volumes of telemetry.

---

## Release-Specific Views

Operational teams should be able to isolate telemetry for a specific release.

For example:

```text
release_version = v4.8.0
```

or:

```text
deployment_id = prod-20260810-001
```

Release-specific filtering is essential when multiple versions coexist during:

* rolling deployments;
* canary deployments;
* phased releases;
* blue-green deployments.

---

## Comparative Observability

Where possible, FamilyOS should support comparison between release states.

For example:

```text
Previous Release
      |
      +---- Error Rate
      +---- Latency
      +---- Resource Usage
      +---- Workflow Success
      |
      v
Comparison
      ^
      |
Current Release
      |
      +---- Error Rate
      +---- Latency
      +---- Resource Usage
      +---- Workflow Success
```

Comparative analysis helps detect regressions that absolute thresholds may miss.

---

## Release Verification

Release observability provides the runtime evidence required for post-deployment verification.

Verification should evaluate predefined signals rather than rely solely on operator intuition.

Possible checks include:

```text
health_status == healthy
critical_workflow_success == true
error_rate <= approved_threshold
latency <= approved_threshold
dependency_status == acceptable
security_alerts == none_critical
```

The exact thresholds depend on the component and release risk.

---

## Stabilization Window

Production releases should have an appropriate stabilization window.

During this period, release telemetry receives increased attention.

The stabilization window helps detect failures that do not appear immediately after deployment.

Signals may include:

* delayed errors;
* memory growth;
* queue accumulation;
* retry storms;
* scheduled job failures;
* integration failures;
* performance degradation;
* data consistency problems.

The stabilization window should be proportional to release risk.

---

## Release Acceptance

A production release should not be considered fully accepted until required runtime evidence has been evaluated.

Release acceptance may require:

```text
deployment_completed == true
verification_passed == true
critical_alerts == none
stabilization_status == acceptable
release_health == acceptable
```

Acceptance converts deployment completion into an evidence-based release outcome.

---

## Alerting

Alerts must identify conditions that require operational attention.

Release-related alerts may cover:

* deployment failure;
* health check failure;
* error rate increase;
* latency increase;
* critical workflow failure;
* dependency failure;
* plugin failure;
* migration failure;
* security anomaly;
* data integrity signal.

Alerts should be actionable.

An alert should help operators understand:

* what failed;
* where it failed;
* which release is affected;
* how severe the problem is;
* what evidence is available.

---

## Alert Severity

Release alerts should use a consistent severity model.

For example:

```text
INFO
WARNING
ERROR
CRITICAL
```

Severity should reflect operational impact rather than implementation detail.

Critical alerts may trigger:

* deployment pause;
* release escalation;
* rollback evaluation;
* incident response.

---

## Alert Fatigue

Excessive or low-quality alerts reduce operational effectiveness.

Release observability must therefore avoid alerting on every telemetry variation.

Alerts should be based on meaningful conditions.

The framework should continuously evaluate:

* false positives;
* duplicate alerts;
* obsolete alerts;
* noisy thresholds;
* missing alerts.

Alert quality is part of observability quality.

---

## Anomaly Detection

Thresholds are useful but may not detect every regression.

Where appropriate, release observability may use anomaly detection to identify unexpected deviations from established behavior.

Examples include:

* unusual latency distribution;
* unexpected error patterns;
* abnormal resource consumption;
* unusual dependency behavior;
* unexpected plugin failure patterns.

Anomaly detection should support human decision-making.

It must not automatically classify every deviation as a release failure.

---

## Rollback Decision Support

Observability is a primary input into rollback decisions.

The decision model may use:

```text
Deployment Evidence
       +
Runtime Metrics
       +
Logs
       +
Health Signals
       +
Security Signals
       +
User Impact
       |
       v
Release Assessment
       |
       +-------------------+
       |                   |
       v                   v
Continue              Recovery Action
                           |
                    +------+------+
                    |             |
                    v             v
                 Rollback    Forward Recovery
```

Rollback decisions must consider evidence from multiple signals when practical.

---

## Recovery Observability

Observability must continue during rollback and recovery.

Recovery operations should expose:

* rollback start;
* target version;
* artifact restoration;
* configuration restoration;
* migration recovery;
* service restart;
* health restoration;
* verification results;
* rollback completion.

Recovery is not complete until the recovered state has been observed and verified.

---

## Observability During Failed Rollback

A failed rollback must remain observable.

The system should clearly distinguish:

```text
RELEASE_FAILED
ROLLBACK_STARTED
ROLLBACK_FAILED
RECOVERY_IN_PROGRESS
```

Ambiguous operational state during recovery increases risk.

Recovery status must therefore be visible to operators and incident management.

---

## Release Evidence

Release observability contributes directly to release evidence.

Evidence may include:

* deployment timestamps;
* release metadata;
* health results;
* verification results;
* dashboard snapshots or references;
* alert history;
* migration results;
* rollback events;
* recovery results;
* stabilization results;
* final acceptance decision.

Evidence should reference authoritative telemetry rather than unnecessarily duplicate large volumes of operational data.

---

## Evidence Retention

Release observability evidence must be retained according to applicable FamilyOS retention policies.

Retention periods may vary depending on:

* operational requirements;
* release criticality;
* security requirements;
* compliance requirements;
* storage constraints.

The framework must preserve sufficient historical information to support:

* incident investigation;
* release review;
* trend analysis;
* audit;
* continuous improvement.

---

## Observability Reliability

Observability infrastructure is itself operational infrastructure.

Its failure can reduce the ability to assess release safety.

Critical release observability capabilities should therefore have appropriate reliability expectations.

The release process should identify situations where:

```text
observability_status == unavailable
```

or:

```text
observability_status == degraded
```

A significant loss of observability during deployment may justify pausing release progression.

---

## Missing Telemetry

Missing telemetry must not automatically be interpreted as healthy behavior.

For example:

```text
no_errors_reported
```

is not equivalent to:

```text
error_monitoring_confirmed_healthy
```

Telemetry absence may indicate:

* instrumentation failure;
* network failure;
* collection failure;
* service failure;
* configuration failure.

Release gates must distinguish healthy signals from missing signals.

---

## Observability Validation

Observability must be validated before it is relied upon for production release decisions.

Validation may confirm:

* metrics are emitted;
* logs contain release identity;
* traces are correlated correctly;
* health checks function;
* deployment markers appear;
* alerts trigger correctly;
* dashboards display the intended signals.

Observability verification should be part of release readiness for critical components.

---

## Release Readiness Integration

Release readiness must evaluate observability preparedness.

A release readiness checklist may include:

```text
[ ] Release identity defined
[ ] Deployment markers configured
[ ] Critical metrics available
[ ] Health checks validated
[ ] Logs correlated with release
[ ] Required dashboards available
[ ] Critical alerts configured
[ ] Dependency signals available
[ ] Plugin signals available where required
[ ] Security signals integrated
[ ] Recovery observability defined
```

Missing critical observability must be treated as release risk.

---

## Release Gate Integration

Observability may participate directly in automated release gates.

Example conditions:

```text
observability_ready == true
health_checks_available == true
critical_metrics_available == true
release_identity_visible == true
critical_alerting_ready == true
```

Post-deployment gates may evaluate:

```text
health_status == healthy
critical_errors == 0
error_rate <= threshold
latency <= threshold
critical_workflows == healthy
```

Automated gates must fail safely when required telemetry is unavailable.

---

## Progressive Delivery

Release observability is especially important for progressive delivery strategies.

These may include:

* canary releases;
* phased rollouts;
* rolling deployments;
* blue-green deployments;
* percentage-based exposure.

Each progression stage should be evaluated using runtime evidence.

Example:

```text
5% Traffic
    |
    v
Observe
    |
    v
Accept?
  /   \
No     Yes
|       |
v       v
Stop   25%
        |
        v
      Observe
```

Progression must stop when release health becomes unacceptable.

---

## Canary Observability

Canary deployments require comparison between canary and baseline populations.

Relevant comparisons may include:

* error rate;
* latency;
* resource utilization;
* workflow success;
* dependency behavior;
* security signals.

A canary is useful only when its behavior can be observed independently.

---

## Blue-Green Observability

Blue-green deployment requires clear visibility into both environments.

Observability should identify:

```text
blue.release_version
green.release_version
active_environment
traffic_state
health_state
```

Traffic switching must be observable and reversible.

---

## Release Metrics

The Release Framework should maintain metrics about release observability itself.

Useful metrics include:

* percentage of releases with complete observability;
* percentage of deployments with valid release markers;
* percentage of releases with automated health verification;
* time to detect release regression;
* time to correlate incident with release;
* percentage of rollbacks supported by telemetry;
* observability failure rate during deployment;
* alert accuracy;
* telemetry coverage of critical services.

These metrics support maturity assessment.

---

## Release Observability Maturity

Release observability maturity can evolve through several stages.

```text
Level 1 — Basic
Manual logs and health checks

Level 2 — Structured
Release-aware metrics and structured logs

Level 3 — Correlated
Metrics, logs, traces, and deployments correlated

Level 4 — Automated
Automated verification and release gates

Level 5 — Predictive
Advanced anomaly detection and progressive delivery intelligence
```

The framework should evolve incrementally rather than require maximum sophistication immediately.

---

## Relationship With Rollback and Recovery

Release observability provides the evidence required by rollback and recovery.

Without observability, operators may not know:

* whether rollback is necessary;
* whether rollback succeeded;
* whether the previous release is healthy;
* whether residual failures remain.

The relationship is:

```text
Observability
     |
     v
Release Assessment
     |
     v
Recovery Decision
     |
     v
Rollback / Forward Recovery
     |
     v
Recovery Observability
     |
     v
Recovery Verification
```

Rollback and observability therefore form complementary release capabilities.

---

## Relationship With Quality Framework

The Quality Framework defines quality expectations.

Release observability determines whether those expectations remain satisfied after deployment.

Quality requirements become operational signals where practical.

Examples include:

* availability;
* performance;
* reliability;
* correctness;
* security.

Runtime evidence therefore extends quality assurance into production.

---

## Relationship With Testing Framework

Testing provides controlled pre-release evidence.

Observability provides runtime evidence.

These capabilities complement one another.

```text
Testing
   |
   v
Pre-Release Confidence
   |
   v
Deployment
   |
   v
Observability
   |
   v
Runtime Confidence
```

Production observability must never be used as a substitute for appropriate testing.

---

## Relationship With Build Framework

The Build Framework establishes artifact identity and provenance.

Release observability uses that identity to correlate deployed behavior with exact artifacts.

Artifact metadata should flow through:

```text
Source
  |
  v
Build
  |
  v
Artifact
  |
  v
Release
  |
  v
Deployment
  |
  v
Runtime Telemetry
```

This creates end-to-end traceability.

---

## Relationship With Security

Security observability must integrate with release observability where release changes may affect the security posture.

Security regressions must be detectable after deployment.

Security telemetry remains governed by the FamilyOS security architecture and applicable data protection requirements.

---

## Governance

Release observability is governed by the FamilyOS Release Framework.

Governance must ensure that:

* critical releases are observable;
* release identity is available;
* deployment events are traceable;
* critical health signals exist;
* observability supports rollback decisions;
* telemetry respects security and privacy;
* significant observability gaps are treated as release risk.

Exceptions require explicit risk acceptance.

---

## Continuous Improvement

Observability must evolve based on operational experience.

Improvement inputs include:

* release incidents;
* missed regressions;
* false alerts;
* delayed detection;
* rollback events;
* telemetry gaps;
* operator feedback;
* post-release reviews.

Improvements may include:

* additional instrumentation;
* better release metadata;
* improved dashboards;
* better thresholds;
* stronger correlation;
* automated verification;
* improved anomaly detection;
* stronger progressive delivery controls.

---

## Anti-Patterns

The following practices are prohibited or strongly discouraged.

### Deployment Without Release Identity

Running production software without knowing exactly which release is active.

### Logs Without Release Context

Producing diagnostic information that cannot be associated with a release.

### Monitoring Only Infrastructure

Observing CPU and memory while ignoring application and workflow health.

### Missing Deployment Markers

Changing production state without recording when the change occurred.

### Treating Missing Telemetry as Healthy

Assuming that absence of errors means successful operation.

### Excessive Alerting

Generating so many alerts that meaningful release failures become difficult to identify.

### Dashboard-Only Observability

Depending on visual dashboards without preserving authoritative underlying telemetry.

### Observability After Failure

Adding instrumentation only after a production problem has already occurred.

### Sensitive Data Leakage

Exposing secrets, credentials, private content, or unnecessary personal information through telemetry.

### Deployment Success Equals Release Success

Declaring a release successful merely because deployment tooling completed without error.

---

## Required Outcomes

Implementation of this framework section must ensure that:

* production releases have identifiable runtime versions;
* deployments generate observable lifecycle events;
* critical runtime behavior can be correlated with releases;
* health signals support release verification;
* metrics, logs, traces, and events provide appropriate diagnostic evidence;
* plugin and dependency health can be evaluated where required;
* security-relevant release signals are visible;
* observability supports rollback and recovery decisions;
* recovered states can be verified;
* telemetry respects security and privacy requirements;
* release acceptance is supported by runtime evidence;
* observability findings drive continuous improvement.

## Final Release Observability Principle

A production deployment is not evidence of production success.

FamilyOS must be capable of observing the behavior of every significant release and connecting runtime outcomes to the exact change that introduced them.

The final principle is:

> FamilyOS must be able to identify what was released, observe how it behaves, detect when it deviates from expectations, and produce sufficient evidence to decide whether the release should continue, pause, roll back, or recover.

Release observability therefore transforms production deployment from an uncertain transition into a measurable, traceable, and governable stage of the FamilyOS release lifecycle.
