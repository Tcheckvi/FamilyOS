# EPIC-REL-001 — Release Framework Revision History

## Document Purpose

This document records the evolution of **EPIC-REL-001 — Release Framework**.

It preserves the historical development, publication, canonical structure, validation, governance, and post-release normalization history of the FamilyOS Release Framework.

The revision history distinguishes between:

* framework versioning;
* repository release tagging;
* immutable historical publication;
* canonical documentation structure;
* control-document normalization;
* validation evidence;
* post-release corrections;
* current revalidation;
* future framework evolution.

## Revision Principles

The Release Framework revision history follows several foundational principles.

### Historical Integrity

Published release state SHALL remain historically identifiable.

An official release tag SHALL NOT be moved to a later correction commit merely because documentation is normalized or revalidated after publication.

---

### Explicit Evolution

Material framework changes SHOULD remain traceable.

Changes affecting:

* release principles;
* release architecture;
* release lifecycle;
* versioning;
* release types;
* release channels;
* readiness;
* candidates;
* artifacts;
* provenance;
* validation;
* automation;
* CI/CD integration;
* repository tagging;
* publication;
* rollback;
* security;
* observability;
* governance;
* compliance;
* metrics;
* risk;

SHOULD be associated with explicit revision history.

---

### Evidence-Based Validation

Validation state SHALL reflect actual evidence.

A documented validation requirement SHALL NOT become PASS merely because it exists.

Only successful execution, inspection, review, or other accepted evidence may establish a PASS result.

---

### Canonical Structural Consistency

The canonical framework inventory SHALL remain synchronized across:

* `EPIC.yaml`;
* `MANIFEST.md`;
* `README.md`;
* `CHANGELOG.md`;
* `VALIDATION.md`;
* `Revision-History.md`;
* `EPIC-REL-001.md`.

---

## Framework Versioning

The historically published Release Framework version is:

```text
4.8.0
```

This version is retained as part of the historical framework identity.

Post-release normalization SHALL NOT rewrite version `4.8.0` merely to conform to a different framework's versioning convention.

---

## Framework Version vs Repository History

The Release Framework version and Git history serve different purposes.

Framework version:

```text
4.8.0
```

Historical publication tag:

```text
v4.8.0-release-framework
```

Historical publication commit:

```text
306338d7ca3df2c1d4d9b74247a837aa01deb637
```

A later correction commit may have a different repository identity while the framework remains version `4.8.0`.

---

## Canonical Structure History

The current canonical Release Framework structure consists of:

```text
32 numbered documents
+
7 control documents
=
39 canonical files
```

Canonical numbered range:

```text
00 → 31
```

The seven control documents are:

```text
EPIC-REL-001.md
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

This represents the authoritative current structure for EPIC-REL-001.

---

## Canonical Numbered Documents

The numbered sequence is:

```text
00-EPIC.md
01-Context.md
02-Vision.md
03-Release-Principles.md
04-Release-Architecture.md
05-Release-Lifecycle.md
06-Versioning-Strategy.md

* Release Lifecycle;
* Versioning Strategy;
* Release Types and Channels;
* Release Planning;
* Release Readiness;
* Release Candidates;
* Artifacts and Provenance;
* Release Validation;

* Release Security;
* Release Observability;
* Release Governance;
* Release Compliance;
* Release Metrics;
* Release Risk Management;
* Framework Lifecycle;
* Roadmap;
* Framework Validation;
* Release Completion;
* Implementation Planning.

---

## Version 4.8.0 Structural Baseline

The canonical structural baseline is:

| Category           |     Count |
| ------------------ | --------: |
| Numbered Documents |        32 |
| Control Documents  |         7 |
| Canonical Files    |        39 |
| Canonical Range    | `00 → 31` |

This structure SHALL remain authoritative unless a future governed revision explicitly changes it.

---

## Historical Publication

Version `4.8.0` was historically published under:

```text
v4.8.0-release-framework
```

Historical publication commit:

```text
306338d7ca3df2c1d4d9b74247a837aa01deb637
```

Annotated tag object:

```text
6173105841167426c17ec08486980abb56e7085b
```

The relationship is:

```text
Release Framework 4.8.0
        ↓
Historical Repository Publication
        ↓
v4.8.0-release-framework
        ↓
306338d7ca3df2c1d4d9b74247a837aa01deb637
```

---

## Historical Tag Immutability

The tag:

```text
v4.8.0-release-framework
```

SHALL remain immutable.

Post-release changes SHALL NOT:

* move the tag;
* delete and recreate it to reference another commit;
* rewrite its target;
* reinterpret a later correction commit as the original publication;
* overwrite historical publication evidence.

Corrections SHALL be represented by ordinary forward commits.

---

## Historical Publication Evidence

The historical tag audit established:

```text
Annotated Tag Object:
6173105841167426c17ec08486980abb56e7085b

Dereferenced Tag Commit:
306338d7ca3df2c1d4d9b74247a837aa01deb637
```

Remote inspection showed that the remote annotated tag dereferences to the same historical publication commit.

This distinction matters because:

```text
annotated tag object
        ≠
tag target commit
```

The dereferenced commit is the authoritative historical publication commit.

---

## Release Architecture Revision

Version `4.8.0` establishes a dedicated Release Architecture separating:

```text
Release Planning
Release Readiness
Release Candidate
Artifacts
Provenance
Validation
Approval
Release Identity
Publication
Distribution
Recovery
Governance
Evidence
```

This prevents release engineering from collapsing into a single tag or publication command.

---

## Release Lifecycle Revision

The framework establishes an explicit lifecycle conceptually including:

```text
PLANNED
    ↓
PREPARING
    ↓
READY
    ↓
CANDIDATE
    ↓
VALIDATED
    ↓
APPROVED
    ↓
TAGGED
    ↓
PUBLISHED
    ↓
VERIFIED
    ↓
COMPLETED
```

Alternative states may include:

```text
BLOCKED
FAILED
WITHDRAWN
ROLLED_BACK
RECOVERING
```

---

## Release Identity Revision

Version `4.8.0` establishes explicit release identity through combinations of:

* version;
* candidate identity;
* source commit;
* release tag;
* artifact identity;
* provenance;
* publication metadata.

Release identity SHALL remain traceable across the release lifecycle.

---

## Release Candidate Revision

The framework establishes Release Candidates as sufficiently stable release objects suitable for validation and approval.

The candidate that is validated SHALL remain traceable to the candidate considered for publication.

---

## Artifact Revision

Release artifacts are treated as explicit release objects.

Artifacts should preserve:

* identity;
* version;
* integrity;
* checksums where appropriate;
* Build Evidence;
* candidate association;
* provenance;
* publication status.

---

## Provenance Revision

Version `4.8.0` establishes provenance as a first-class release concept.

Provenance may connect:

```text
source commit
build state
artifact identity
candidate identity
release version
publication target
publication result
```

This supports traceability and long-term reconstruction.

---

## Validation Revision

The Release Framework distinguishes:

```text
Build Validation
Testing Evidence
Quality Evidence
Security Evidence
Release Validation
Framework Validation
```

Release Validation qualifies the exact candidate intended for publication.

Framework Validation evaluates EPIC-REL-001 itself.

---

## Publication Revision

Version `4.8.0` defines publication as a controlled release state transition.

The framework explicitly distinguishes:

```text
attempted publication
```

from:

```text
verified publication
```

A successful command alone does not establish successful publication.

---

## Publication / Distribution Revision

Publication and distribution are distinct concepts.

Publication establishes authoritative release state.

Distribution determines how release material reaches consumers.

A release may be published while some distribution transitions occur later.

---

## Partial Publication Revision

The framework explicitly recognizes partial publication.

If some mandatory publication operations succeed and others fail, the state SHALL remain visible.

Partial publication SHALL NOT be represented as full success.

---

## Rollback and Recovery Revision

Rollback and recovery are built into the release architecture.

The framework defines responses to:

* failed validation;
* failed publication;
* partial publication;
* defective release;
* withdrawal;
* rollback;
* restoration;
* corrective publication.

---

## Security Revision

The framework defines release-specific security responsibilities including:

* publication authority;
* release credentials;
* artifact integrity;
* provenance;
* protected automation;
* trusted execution environments;
* repository protections;
* release authorization.

---

## Observability Revision

Release observability establishes visibility into:

* lifecycle state;
* candidate state;
* validation;
* approval;
* publication;
* partial publication;
* failures;
* rollback;
* recovery;
* completion.

---

## Governance Revision

Release Governance distinguishes:

* ownership;
* technical validation;
* approval authority;
* publication authority;
* exception authority;
* risk acceptance;
* emergency release authority;
* withdrawal authority;
* framework evolution authority.

---

## Compliance Revision

Release Compliance defines how release requirements, evidence, exceptions, and controls are evaluated.

Compliance does not replace technical validation.

It complements release decision-making.

---

## Metrics Revision

The framework establishes release metrics such as:

* release frequency;
* lead time;
* validation duration;
* publication duration;
* failure rate;
* rollback rate;
* recovery time;
* partial publication rate.

Metrics SHALL support improvement rather than automatically determine release correctness.

---

## Risk Revision

The framework establishes explicit release-risk management.

Relevant risks include:

* incorrect version;
* candidate mutation;
* stale artifacts;
* wrong source commit;
* publication collision;
* incomplete validation;
* unauthorized publication;
* partial publication;
* publication-target failure;
* rollback failure;
* provenance loss.

---

## Automation Revision

The framework establishes automation as execution of canonical release semantics.

Automation SHALL NOT become the release architecture itself.

A release pipeline implements governed release policy.

It does not invent release policy.

---

## CI/CD Revision

The Release Framework establishes a separation between:

```text
validation pipelines
```

and:

```text
privileged publication pipelines
```

This supports least privilege and prevents ordinary validation jobs from automatically acquiring stable publication authority.

---

## Build / Release Boundary Revision

The Build Framework produces trusted artifacts.

The Release Framework consumes those artifacts and governs:

* release readiness;
* candidate identity;
* versioning;
* approval;
* tagging;
* publication;
* distribution;
* rollback;
* recovery.

The relationship is:

```text
Build Framework
        ↓
Trusted Artifact Set
        ↓
Release Framework
        ↓
Official Release
```

---

## Testing Boundary Revision

The Testing Framework remains authoritative for testing methodology.

The Release Framework consumes testing evidence as part of readiness and validation.

---

## Quality Boundary Revision

The Quality Framework owns general quality rules and quality-gate semantics.

The Release Framework consumes quality evidence within release decisions.

---

## Security Boundary Revision

The Security Framework owns general security architecture.

The Release Framework applies security requirements to release-specific concerns such as credentials, artifact integrity, publication authority, and supply-chain trust.

---

## Operations Boundary Revision

Release publication and runtime operations remain distinct.

The Release Framework does not automatically own deployment or runtime management.

The Operations Framework remains authoritative for operational runtime concerns.

---

## Post-Release Normalization

Following publication, EPIC-REL-001 may receive documentation corrections that improve current canonical consistency without redefining the historical identity of version `4.8.0`.

Examples include:

* machine-readable metadata correction;
* canonical inventory synchronization;
* active lifecycle-state correction;
* historical-publication clarification;
* validation-record normalization;
* control-document alignment;
* terminology corrections;
* malformed text-join corrections.

---

## Post-Release Revalidation

The current activity is a post-release revalidation.

Its purpose is to confirm that the current canonical representation remains consistent with:

* the physical repository;
* canonical numbering `00 → 31`;
* 32 numbered documents;
* seven control documents;
* 39 canonical files;
* historical publication evidence;
* framework architecture;
* framework lifecycle;
* versioning;
* readiness;
* candidate semantics;
* artifact provenance;
* publication semantics;
* recovery;
* security;
* observability;
* governance;
* repository quality gates.

---

## Revalidation Scope

The current revalidation includes:

```text
YAML Parse
YAML Contract
Filesystem Contract
Canonical Inventory
Numbering Integrity
Control Document Integrity
Empty File Validation
Manifest Synchronization
README Synchronization
EPIC Summary Synchronization
CHANGELOG Synchronization
Revision History Synchronization
State Consistency
Reference Integrity
Release Architecture Consistency
Release Lifecycle Consistency
Versioning Consistency
Readiness Consistency
Candidate Consistency
Artifact and Provenance Consistency
Publication Semantic Consistency
Rollback and Recovery Consistency
Release Security Consistency
Observability Consistency
Governance Consistency
Framework Boundary Validation
Placeholder Validation
Join Defect Validation
Ruff
MyPy
Pytest
Repository Diff Validation
Historical Tag Integrity
Remote Branch Verification
Final Repository Cleanliness
```

---

## Validation Evidence Policy

Validation evidence SHALL be revision-aware.

Evidence produced for one repository state does not automatically prove a later modified repository state.

The required model is:

```text
Execute
    ↓
Observe
    ↓
Evaluate
    ↓
Record
```

---

## Revalidation State Model

During current normalization:

```yaml
baseline:
  framework_version: 4.8.0
  documentation_status: completed
  repository_validation_status: pending_revalidation
  final_validation_status: pending_revalidation
```

After successful evidence-based revalidation:

```yaml
baseline:
  framework_version: 4.8.0
  documentation_status: completed
  repository_validation_status: validated
  final_validation_status: validated
```

---

## Historical Release Metadata

Historical release metadata remains:

```yaml
release:
  historical_tag: v4.8.0-release-framework
  historical_commit: 306338d7ca3df2c1d4d9b74247a837aa01deb637
  publication_status: published
  historical_tag_immutable: true
  remote_publication_verified: true
```

These values describe historical publication and do not depend on current revalidation completion.

---

## Current Canonical Inventory

```text
Numbered Documents: 32
Control Documents:   7
Canonical Files:    39
Canonical Range:    00 → 31
```

The physical filesystem audit observed:

```text
all files: 39
numbered: 32
first numbered: 00-EPIC.md
last numbered: 31-Implementation-Checklist.md
control files: 7
missing controls: []
unexpected controls: []
```

Final structural validation SHALL be rerun after normalization.

---

## Current Publication Relationship

The historical relationship is:

```text
EPIC-REL-001
Release Framework
Version 4.8.0
        ↓
Historical Publication
        ↓
v4.8.0-release-framework
        ↓
306338d7ca3df2c1d4d9b74247a837aa01deb637
```

Current corrections occur later in repository history.

They SHALL NOT change this relationship.

---

## Current Repository Relationship

Current repository HEAD may be newer than:

```text
306338d7ca3df2c1d4d9b74247a837aa01deb637
```

This is expected.

The correct model is:

```text
Historical Publication
        ↓
Later Repository Evolution
        ↓
Post-Release Documentation Normalization
        ↓
Current Revalidation
```

---

## Revision Classification

Release Framework changes may be classified as follows.

### Editorial

Examples:

* spelling correction;
* grammar correction;
* formatting correction;
* non-semantic wording improvement.

Expected version impact:

```text
Usually none
```

---

### Documentation Normalization

Examples:

* stale active-state correction;
* metadata normalization;
* canonical inventory synchronization;
* validation-record correction;
* control-document alignment.

Expected version impact:

```text
Usually none
```

when framework semantics remain unchanged.

---

### Compatible Semantic Change

Examples:

* new compatible release profile;
* compatible evidence extension;
* compatible release metadata extension;
* compatible optional publication capability.

Expected version impact:

```text
MINOR
```

subject to FamilyOS release governance.

---

### Breaking Semantic Change

Examples:

* incompatible lifecycle state changes;
* incompatible version semantics;
* incompatible candidate identity rules;
* incompatible publication contract;
* incompatible artifact trust semantics.

Expected version impact:

```text
MAJOR
```

subject to governance.

---

## Historical Record Policy

Historical states SHALL remain preserved when they represent actual earlier lifecycle conditions.

For example, historical references to:

```text
in-progress
prepared
pending
candidate
```

may remain if clearly associated with an earlier historical phase.

They SHALL NOT remain as the current authoritative state after historical publication has already occurred.

---

## Active State Policy

The current authoritative historical framework state is:

```text
Framework Status:       Completed
Historical Publication: Published
```

The current post-release activity is:

```text
Post-Release Revalidation
```

During current revalidation:

```text
Repository Validation: Validated
Final Revalidation:     Validated
```

These current validation states SHALL transition only after actual evidence supports them.

---

## Control Document Synchronization

Post-release normalization requires synchronization of:

```text
EPIC-REL-001.md
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

These documents SHALL agree on:

* identifier;
* title;
* version;
* completed framework status;
* canonical structure;
* historical publication;
* historical tag;
* historical commit;
* current revalidation state.

---

## Revalidation Completion Requirements

Current revalidation may be considered technically complete only when:

* `EPIC.yaml` parses;
* YAML contract passes;
* filesystem contract passes;
* numbering passes;
* all control documents exist;
* no required canonical file is empty;
* manifest synchronization passes;
* reference integrity passes;
* active state consistency passes;
* release architecture review passes;
* lifecycle review passes;
* versioning review passes;
* readiness review passes;
* candidate review passes;
* artifact/provenance review passes;
* publication semantics pass;
* rollback/recovery semantics pass;
* security semantics pass;
* observability semantics pass;
* governance review passes;
* framework boundaries pass;
* placeholder validation passes;
* join-defect validation passes;
* Ruff passes;
* MyPy passes;
* Pytest passes;
* Git diff validation passes;
* historical tag integrity passes.

---

## Repository Completion Requirements

Post-release normalization workflow is fully complete when:

* correction files are staged;
* staged content is validated;
* post-release correction commit is created;
* quality gates pass after commit;
* branch is pushed;
* authoritative remote branch matches local HEAD;
* historical tag remains unchanged locally and remotely;
* working tree is clean.

---

## Future Revisions

Future Release Framework revisions may introduce:

* executable release state machines;
* machine-readable release profiles;
* canonical candidate manifests;
* release evidence schemas;
* automated version reservation;
* automated release readiness;
* stronger artifact attestations;
* artifact signing;
* automated provenance validation;
* protected publication orchestration;
* multi-target publication transactions;
* automated rollback orchestration;
* release-policy engines;
* release compliance automation;
* advanced release observability.

These future capabilities SHALL preserve the foundational framework principles unless explicitly released as breaking changes.

---

## Current Revision State

```text
EPIC:                    EPIC-REL-001
Framework:               Release Framework
Framework Version:       4.8.0
Framework Status:        Completed

Numbered Documents:      32
Control Documents:        7
Canonical Files:         39
Canonical Range:         00 → 31

Historical Publication:  Published
Historical Tag:          v4.8.0-release-framework
Historical Tag Object:   6173105841167426c17ec08486980abb56e7085b

Historical Tag Policy:   Immutable

Current Activity:        Post-Release Revalidation
Repository Revalidation: Validated
Final Revalidation:      Validated
```

---

## Current Validation Evidence Status

Historical publication evidence has been identified.

Current repository revalidation evidence is complete and records a validated repository state.

The authoritative current execution evidence belongs in:

```text
VALIDATION.md
```

Current evidence supports final repository validation while preserving the immutable historical publication record.

---

## Final Revision Principle

EPIC-REL-001 — Release Framework version `4.8.0` establishes the canonical FamilyOS release engineering foundation.

Its canonical documentation structure consists of:

```text
32 numbered documents
7 control documents
39 canonical files
```

Version `4.8.0` was historically published under:

```text
v4.8.0-release-framework
```

at:

```text
306338d7ca3df2c1d4d9b74247a837aa01deb637
```

That historical publication identity is immutable.

Current post-release normalization may improve metadata, documentation consistency, validation evidence, and active-state accuracy without rewriting historical publication.

Future revisions SHALL preserve:

* explicit release identity;
* candidate stability;
* artifact provenance;
* validation integrity;
* publication verification;
* recovery capability;
* governance separation;
* historical release integrity.
