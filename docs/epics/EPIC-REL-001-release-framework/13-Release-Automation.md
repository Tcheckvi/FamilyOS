# Release Framework

## 13 Release Automation

### Overview

EPIC-REL-001 — Release Framework defines Release Automation as the set of controlled mechanisms used to execute repeatable release operations with reduced manual variability.

Release Automation exists to implement the Release Framework.

It does not define release policy by itself.

The purpose of automation is to make release activities:

* repeatable;
* observable;
* deterministic where practical;
* safer to execute;
* easier to validate;
* easier to recover;
* less dependent on individual memory.

Automation must preserve the semantics established by:

* Release Planning;
* Release Readiness;
* Release Candidates;
* Release Validation;
* Versioning;
* Governance;
* Publishing;
* Recovery.

---

## Purpose

The Release Automation model establishes:

* automation principles;
* automation boundaries;
* automation responsibilities;
* deterministic execution expectations;
* failure handling;
* idempotency;
* dry-run capability;
* state management;
* evidence generation;
* automation security;
* approval integration;
* release orchestration;
* progressive automation maturity.

The objective is to prevent FamilyOS release processes from becoming collections of opaque scripts while still enabling strong operational efficiency.

---

## Automation Principle

The central principle is:

> Automation executes release rules; it does not invent them.

The intended relationship is:

```text id="8bbhwy"
Release Framework
      ↓
Release Policy
      ↓
Release Workflow
      ↓
Automation
```

The inverse model is invalid:

```text id="65wg2m"
automation script
      ↓
whatever it does
      ↓
becomes release policy
```

Release semantics must remain documented independently from implementation.

---

## Why Release Automation Is Necessary

Manual release processes introduce several risks.

These include:

* command ordering errors;
* forgotten checks;
* inconsistent version selection;
* accidental tag creation;
* publication to wrong targets;
* missing evidence;
* incomplete recovery;
* credential misuse;
* differences between maintainers.

Automation reduces these risks when the underlying process is already well defined.

---

## Automation Does Not Remove Governance

Automation may execute:

* validation;
* version checks;
* candidate creation;
* tag generation;
* artifact upload;
* release note generation;
* publication verification.

However, automation MUST NOT silently bypass required governance decisions.

For example:

```text id="7kyj6e"
validation passes
```

does not automatically mean:

```text id="75sl62"
release approved
```

unless the applicable governance policy explicitly permits automatic approval.

---

## Automation Domains

Release Automation may cover the following domains:

```text id="d4taeh"
Planning Assistance
Readiness Evaluation
Candidate Creation
Validation
Versioning
Artifact Handling
Provenance
Tagging
Release Notes
Publishing
Distribution
Verification
Evidence Collection
Recovery
```

Automation may be introduced incrementally.

---

## Planning Automation

Automation may assist Release Planning by:

* detecting changed components;
* identifying release scope;
* suggesting release type;
* identifying candidate version;
* detecting dependencies;
* generating release plan templates.

Planning automation should remain advisory where human judgment is required.

---

## Scope Detection

A future release tool may examine repository changes and infer:

```text id="8j4va9"
docs only
→ documentation release

plugin directory changed
→ plugin release

core platform changed
→ platform release candidate
```

Inference should support the maintainer.

It must not silently override explicit release intent.

---

## Readiness Automation

Release Readiness contains many deterministic checks suitable for automation.

Examples include:

* repository cleanliness;
* branch verification;
* version validation;
* tag conflict detection;
* file completeness;
* build execution;
* test execution;
* documentation structure;
* compliance rules.

Automated readiness should produce structured results.

---

## Automated Readiness Example

```text id="iqd1xj"
Release Readiness

Repository       PASS
Build            PASS
Tests            PASS
Quality          PASS
Documentation    PASS
Version          PASS

Blockers         0

RESULT           READY
```

Automation should preserve the evidence underneath this summary.

---

## Candidate Creation Automation

Automation may create formal candidate metadata once readiness passes.

Possible responsibilities include:

* candidate number calculation;
* candidate version generation;
* source revision capture;
* artifact inventory;
* checksum generation;
* release manifest creation;
* candidate record creation.

Candidate creation must be idempotent.

---

## Candidate Automation Example

Conceptually:

```text id="q0hoce"
target version:
5.2.0

latest candidate:
rc.2

next candidate:
5.2.0-rc.3
```

Before creation, automation should verify that `rc.3` is not already in use.

---

## Validation Automation

Release Validation contains many automatable operations.

Examples include:

* source identity checks;
* build verification;
* test execution;
* artifact checksum verification;
* metadata validation;
* version consistency;
* release structure validation;
* documentation validation;
* compliance evaluation.

Automation should bind results to candidate identity.

---

## Validation Result Binding

An automated validation result should identify:

```text id="sjg0ar"
candidate
source revision
artifact set
validation profile
execution time
result
```

This prevents evidence from drifting across candidates.

---

## Version Automation

Automation may assist with:

* parsing current version;
* determining candidate version;
* checking semantic ordering;
* detecting duplicate versions;
* validating version increments;
* generating tag names.

Automation may eventually recommend the next version.

Final authority remains governed.

---

## Version Validation Example

```text id="0zhwq6"
Current Version      5.1.0
Requested Version    5.2.0
Expected Increment   MINOR
Syntax               PASS
Ordering             PASS
Conflict             NONE

VERSION VALID
```

---

## Tag Automation

Tagging is highly suitable for controlled automation.

Automation may:

* calculate tag name;
* verify source revision;
* verify working tree state;
* verify tag uniqueness;
* create annotated tag;
* push tag;
* verify remote tag target.

Tag automation must fail before creation if source state is ambiguous.

---

## Tagging Safety Sequence

A safe automated sequence is:

```text id="3vo74l"
verify candidate
      ↓
verify approval
      ↓
verify version
      ↓
verify repository state
      ↓
verify tag does not exist
      ↓
create tag
      ↓
push tag
      ↓
verify remote tag
```

---

## Artifact Automation

Automation may handle:

* artifact discovery;
* artifact classification;
* checksum generation;
* artifact inventory creation;
* upload;
* publication verification.

Unexpected artifacts should trigger failure or review.

---

## Artifact Discovery

Automated artifact discovery must not simply publish every file found in an output directory.

The release profile should define expected artifact patterns.

Example:

```text id="gm8hf7"
Expected:
*.whl
*.tar.gz
release-manifest.json
```

Unexpected files should remain visible.

---

## Checksum Automation

Checksum generation should occur before publication.

Conceptually:

```text id="c6cswi"
artifact
   ↓
sha256
   ↓
candidate evidence
```

After publication:

```text id="62brof"
published artifact
   ↓
sha256
   ↓
compare
```

---

## Provenance Automation

Automation may collect provenance from:

* repository state;
* build environment;
* dependency lock;
* CI job;
* artifact checksums;
* candidate metadata.

Provenance collection should minimize manual transcription.

---

## Release Manifest Automation

A future release workflow may generate a release manifest automatically.

The manifest may include:

```text id="3c6d2v"
version
candidate
source revision
build ID
artifact inventory
checksums
release profile
```

Generated metadata must remain reviewable.

---

## Release Notes Automation

Automation may generate draft release notes from structured change data.

Possible sources include:

* changelog entries;
* commits;
* pull requests;
* issue metadata;
* release plan.

Automatically generated release notes should be reviewed before final publication when human-readable quality matters.

---

## Changelog Automation

Automation may support:

* collecting unreleased changes;
* grouping change categories;
* inserting version;
* inserting release date;
* creating comparison references.

The changelog remains governed by Documentation Framework rules.

---

## Publication Automation

Release publication may be partially or fully automated.

Possible operations include:

* push branch;
* push tag;
* create repository release;
* upload artifacts;
* publish package;
* publish documentation;
* update release metadata.

Publication automation creates external side effects and therefore requires stronger controls.

---

## Publication Safety

Before external publication, automation should verify:

```text id="42k7mh"
candidate validated
approval satisfied
version valid
tag valid
artifacts verified
credentials available
targets available
```

This creates a final publication boundary.

---

## Distribution Automation

Automation may promote a published release to:

* stable channel;
* maintenance channel;
* plugin registry;
* documentation site;
* other consumer channels.

Promotion should not rebuild release artifacts unless explicitly required.

---

## Verification Automation

Post-publication verification should be automated where practical.

Checks may include:

* remote tag exists;
* tag points to correct commit;
* release object exists;
* artifacts exist;
* artifact checksums match;
* package can be resolved;
* stable alias points to intended version.

---

## Evidence Automation

Every automated release step should generate or preserve useful evidence.

Examples include:

* validation results;
* repository state;
* candidate metadata;
* version decision;
* tag creation result;
* publication targets;
* checksums;
* timestamps;
* actor identity.

Evidence should not exist only in transient terminal output.

---

## Automation State

Release automation must maintain enough state to know what has already occurred.

A release workflow should distinguish:

```text id="6z5nku"
not started
in progress
completed
failed
partially completed
```

This is essential for safe retry and recovery.

---

## Stateless Automation Risk

A stateless script that executes:

```text id="o91mm8"
create tag
upload artifact
publish release
```

without remembering which steps succeeded creates recovery risk.

If the second step fails, the script may not know how to resume safely.

---

## Stateful Automation

A more robust workflow records progress:

```text id="5hz968"
tag_created: true
artifact_uploaded: false
release_created: false
```

Recovery can then begin from the actual state.

---

## Idempotency

Release Automation SHOULD be idempotent where practical.

Idempotency means that repeating an operation does not create unintended duplicate state.

Example:

```text id="4lvcpm"
push tag
```

repeated against an identical existing tag should be safe.

If the existing tag points elsewhere, the workflow must block.

---

## Idempotent Tagging

Example logic:

```text id="2ttq07"
if tag does not exist:
    create

if tag exists and points to expected commit:
    verify and continue

if tag exists and points elsewhere:
    block
```

---

## Idempotent Artifact Publishing

Example:

```text id="5b71jd"
if artifact absent:
    upload

if artifact exists and checksum matches:
    verify and continue

if artifact exists and checksum differs:
    block
```

Silent replacement is prohibited.

---

## Retry Safety

Automation should classify operations by retry safety.

Possible classes include:

```text id="4mqclm"
safe retry
verify before retry
manual recovery required
non-reversible
```

This classification improves failure handling.

---

## Dry Run

Release Automation SHOULD support dry-run behavior where practical.

A dry run performs validation without external side effects.

It may calculate:

* version;
* candidate;
* tag;
* artifact set;
* publication targets;
* policy results.

Example:

```text id="03zbcm"
DRY RUN

Version            5.2.0
Tag                v5.2.0
Artifacts          4
Targets            2
Validation         PASS
External Changes   NONE
```

---

## Dry-Run Principle

The release system should discover as many errors as possible before performing irreversible or externally visible operations.

---

## Preflight Validation

A release automation workflow should include a preflight stage.

Preflight may verify:

```text id="fkwnt8"
configuration
credentials
repository
candidate
version
tag
artifacts
targets
permissions
```

Preflight failure should occur before publication side effects.

---

## Automation Failure Model

Automation must represent failures explicitly.

A failure should record:

* workflow;
* stage;
* operation;
* candidate;
* release version;
* completed actions;
* failed action;
* error details;
* recovery recommendation.

---

## Failure Example

```text id="zueoax"
Release: 5.2.0

Tag Creation         PASS
Repository Release   PASS
Artifact Upload      FAIL
Stable Promotion     NOT STARTED

RESULT               FAILED
RECOVERY REQUIRED
```

This is far safer than a generic:

```text id="g0jgyd"
release failed
```

---

## Partial Failure

Multi-system automation must assume partial failure is possible.

Example:

```text id="a0oh4q"
Git remote      updated
Registry        failed
Documentation   unchanged
```

The workflow must preserve this state.

---

## Compensation

Some release operations may support compensating actions.

Examples include:

* deleting an unpublished draft release;
* removing an incorrect channel alias;
* withdrawing a package where registry policy permits;
* restoring a previous stable alias.

Compensation is not always equivalent to true rollback.

---

## Irreversible Operations

Some release operations may be difficult or impossible to reverse safely.

Examples include:

* immutable package publication;
* public disclosure;
* external consumer download;
* irreversible tag consumption by downstream systems.

Automation should execute irreversible operations as late as practical.

---

## Transactional Automation

Where several external actions form one logical release transition, automation should treat them as a transaction-like workflow.

Conceptually:

```text id="fbj8ja"
PREPARE
VALIDATE
AUTHORIZE

BEGIN PUBLICATION

TAG
UPLOAD
CREATE RELEASE
VERIFY

COMMIT RELEASE STATE
```

Perfect atomicity may not be possible.

Stateful recovery must compensate.

---

## Automation Logging

Release automation must produce sufficient logs for diagnosis.

Logs should include:

* release identity;
* candidate;
* operation;
* result;
* timestamps;
* external target;
* errors.

Sensitive values such as secrets must not appear in logs.

---

## Structured Logs

Structured logs are preferable for advanced automation.

Conceptually:

```text id="hcbs1q"
event: release.artifact.publish
release: 5.2.0
artifact: familyos_cli
result: success
```

Structured events improve observability and auditability.

---

## Automation Evidence vs Logs

Logs and evidence are related but distinct.

Logs explain execution.

Release evidence establishes release facts.

Important release facts should not require parsing arbitrary logs years later.

---

## Automation Credentials

Release automation may require privileged credentials.

Credentials MUST be:

* protected;
* scoped;
* injected securely;
* excluded from source;
* excluded from logs;
* rotated when appropriate.

---

## Credential Scope

Different operations should use the minimum necessary privilege.

For example:

```text id="cdgxr8"
validation token
→ read-only

artifact publishing token
→ package publish only

tagging token
→ repository tag permission
```

One unrestricted token for all release operations should be avoided where practical.

---

## Short-Lived Credentials

Future FamilyOS release automation SHOULD prefer short-lived credentials when supported.

Benefits include:

* reduced exposure window;
* easier rotation;
* stronger identity;
* improved auditability.

---

## Automation Identity

Automated release actions should have identifiable execution identity.

Examples include:

* CI service identity;
* release bot;
* authorized workflow identity.

This allows audit records to distinguish automated actions from human actions.

---

## Human Approval Integration

Automation should support explicit pause points for governance decisions.

Example:

```text id="2xpzbx"
candidate validation
      ↓
PASS
      ↓
WAITING FOR APPROVAL
      ↓
authorized approval
      ↓
publication
```

This preserves automation efficiency without eliminating governance.

---

## Approval Tokenization

A future system may represent approval as structured release evidence rather than a simple UI click.

Conceptually:

```text id="9m1v7w"
candidate: 5.2.0-rc.3
approval: granted
scope: stable publication
approver: release authority
```

The specific implementation is not defined here.

---

## Automation Policy Evaluation

Future release automation may evaluate machine-readable policies.

Examples:

```text id="ynx896"
tests == pass
quality == pass
candidate.validated == true
approval == granted
tag.exists == false
```

Policy results should be explainable.

Opaque policy evaluation undermines trust.

---

## Policy Failure

A failed policy should identify:

```text id="5wfg1s"
which rule failed
why
which evidence was used
whether exception is allowed
```

Generic `policy failed` messages are insufficient.

---

## Automation and Release Profiles

Release profiles should drive automation selection.

For example:

```text id="p1eg7f"
framework-release
```

may run:

```text id="28nw6v"
documentation validation
structure validation
repository validation
version validation
tagging workflow
```

while:

```text id="hzsy00"
plugin-release
```

may additionally run:

```text id="t9a5rb"
build
tests
plugin compliance
artifact packaging
registry publication
```

---

## Profile-Driven Automation

The desired model is:

```text id="hf72ft"
Release Profile
      ↓
Required Policies
      ↓
Required Automation Steps
      ↓
Release Workflow
```

This reduces workflow duplication.

---

## Automation Modularity

Release Automation SHOULD use modular operations rather than one opaque script.

Conceptually:

```text id="jnt2mt"
check_repository
check_version
run_validation
create_candidate
create_tag
publish_artifacts
verify_release
```

Modules improve:

* testing;
* reuse;
* recovery;
* observability.

---

## Monolithic Script Risk

A single script containing all release semantics may become:

* difficult to test;
* difficult to recover;
* difficult to govern;
* difficult to reuse;
* difficult to understand.

The framework should favor explicit stages.

---

## Automation Interfaces

Release operations should expose clear inputs and outputs.

Example:

```text id="nfbywj"
Input:
candidate ID

Output:
validation result
evidence reference
```

Clear interfaces support orchestration.

---

## Release Orchestrator

At higher maturity, FamilyOS may introduce a Release Orchestrator.

The orchestrator coordinates release operations across systems.

Potential responsibilities include:

```text id="2crari"
load release plan
evaluate readiness
create candidate
run validation
request approval
finalize version
create tag
publish artifacts
verify targets
record evidence
complete release
```

---

## Orchestrator Principle

The orchestrator coordinates.

It must not hide release semantics.

Its state machine must remain aligned with `05-Release-Lifecycle.md`.

---

## Orchestrator State

A future orchestrator may track:

```text id="hz3wgl"
PLANNED
PREPARED
READY
CANDIDATE
VALIDATED
APPROVED
RELEASED
PUBLISHED
COMPLETED
```

and exceptional states.

This prevents automation state from diverging from framework lifecycle state.

---

## CLI Automation

FamilyOS may expose release automation through CLI commands.

Conceptual examples include:

```text id="fg6gdo"
familyos release plan
familyos release check
familyos release candidate
familyos release validate
familyos release approve
familyos release publish
familyos release verify
familyos release recover
```

These commands are future interfaces, not current requirements.

---

## Non-Interactive Execution

Automation should support non-interactive CI/CD execution where appropriate.

Required inputs should be supplied explicitly through:

* configuration;
* release manifest;
* environment;
* command parameters;
* approved metadata.

Hidden interactive prompts reduce reproducibility.

---

## Interactive Execution

Local tooling MAY offer interactive release assistance.

Interactive mode should produce the same release plan and evidence model as non-interactive execution.

Interactive convenience must not create separate release semantics.

---

## Configuration

Automation configuration should be version-controlled where safe and practical.

Configuration may define:

* release profile;
* artifact patterns;
* validation commands;
* publication targets;
* channel mapping.

Secrets must remain outside committed configuration.

---

## Configuration Validation

Release automation must validate its configuration before execution.

Invalid or missing configuration should fail early.

---

## Environment Isolation

Release automation should minimize dependence on uncontrolled local environments.

Higher maturity may use:

* containers;
* pinned runner images;
* virtual environments;
* reproducible toolchains.

This strengthens repeatability.

---

## Toolchain Pinning

Release-critical tools SHOULD have controlled versions.

Examples include:

* package builders;
* version parsers;
* signing tools;
* publishing clients.

Unexpected toolchain upgrades can change release behavior.

---

## Automation Testing

Release automation itself must be tested.

Testing may include:

* unit tests;
* integration tests;
* dry-run tests;
* failure injection;
* idempotency tests;
* recovery tests.

A release system that cannot safely release itself is a platform risk.

---

## Failure Injection

Mature release tooling SHOULD test failure scenarios.

Examples include:

```text id="d2y062"
tag push fails
artifact upload fails
registry unavailable
credential expired
verification mismatch
```

This validates recovery behavior before real incidents occur.

---

## Automation Recovery

Automation should provide explicit recovery entry points.

Example:

```text id="f688rx"
release failed at artifact upload
```

A recovery operation should resume from the actual state rather than restart blindly from the beginning.

---

## Recovery Command Vision

A future interface may support:

```text id="bb88mz"
familyos release recover <release>
```

which could:

* inspect release state;
* identify completed actions;
* identify failure;
* recommend valid recovery operations.

---

## Automation Rollback

Automation may assist rollback when rollback is technically safe.

Possible steps include:

* change channel alias;
* restore previous version;
* verify previous artifact;
* mark defective release status;
* record recovery evidence.

Rollback authority remains governed.

---

## Automation and Forward Recovery

Where rollback is unsafe, automation should support corrective release workflows.

It must not assume that every failed release can simply be reverted.

---

## Automation Observability

Automation must expose:

* current stage;
* current state;
* operation status;
* blocker;
* failure reason;
* release identity;
* candidate;
* progress.

A user should not need to infer state from raw log volume.

---

## Automation Metrics

Future metrics may include:

* release automation coverage;
* automated validation percentage;
* manual steps per release;
* automation failure rate;
* recovery rate;
* retry success rate;
* mean release execution duration.

Metrics should support improvement.

---

## Automation Maturity Model

FamilyOS release automation may evolve through:

```text id="y8sq00"
Level 1
documented manual commands

Level 2
reusable validation scripts

Level 3
automated readiness checks

Level 4
candidate automation

Level 5
automated tagging

Level 6
automated artifact publication

Level 7
structured release state

Level 8
policy-driven orchestration

Level 9
provenance and signing automation

Level 10
fully observable release platform
```

---

## Current FamilyOS Automation Context

Current FamilyOS framework releases already use a partially standardized manual workflow.

Typical actions include:

```text id="4yyxnb"
git status
validation commands
git commit
git tag -a
git push branch
git push tag
verification
```

EPIC-REL-001 provides the architecture required to gradually transform these commands into safe automation.

---

## Framework Release Automation Example

A future framework release workflow may execute:

```text id="5p21dl"
validate framework structure
      ↓
validate control documents
      ↓
validate repository
      ↓
determine version
      ↓
generate release summary
      ↓
request approval
      ↓
create commit
      ↓
create annotated tag
      ↓
push branch
      ↓
push tag
      ↓
verify remote
```

---

## Plugin Release Automation Example

A plugin release may automate:

```text id="7zcxv5"
build plugin
      ↓
run plugin tests
      ↓
run compliance
      ↓
create artifact
      ↓
checksum artifact
      ↓
create candidate
      ↓
validate
      ↓
approve
      ↓
publish
      ↓
verify
```

---

## Platform Release Automation Example

A mature platform release may orchestrate:

```text id="tc5048"
component validation
      ↓
compatibility matrix
      ↓
platform candidate
      ↓
artifact provenance
      ↓
release validation
      ↓
governance approval
      ↓
multi-target publication
      ↓
channel promotion
      ↓
post-release verification
```

---

## Automation Invariants

The following invariants apply.

### RA1 — Automation implements documented release semantics.

### RA2 — Automation must not silently bypass governance.

### RA3 — Automated actions must identify the release and candidate they affect.

### RA4 — Automation must fail explicitly.

### RA5 — Partial failure must remain observable.

### RA6 — External side effects should occur only after applicable validation.

### RA7 — Automation should be idempotent where practical.

### RA8 — Automation must protect release credentials.

### RA9 — Automation should preserve durable release evidence.

### RA10 — Retry behavior must be safe.

### RA11 — Release automation itself must be testable.

### RA12 — Automation semantics must remain tool-independent.

---

## Automation Anti-Patterns

### Script as Policy

Treating release shell commands as the only authoritative release specification.

---

### Blind Retry

Restarting a failed publication workflow without checking which external side effects already occurred.

---

### Unconditional Tag Creation

Creating tags without verifying candidate, approval, version, and existing tag state.

---

### Publish Everything

Uploading every file in a build directory without validating the expected artifact set.

---

### Hidden Credentials

Embedding tokens inside scripts or repository files.

---

### Success by Exit Code Alone

Declaring a release complete because the final command returned zero without verifying external state.

---

### Automation Without State

Executing multi-step publication without recording progress.

---

### Automated Governance Bypass

Allowing a pipeline to publish simply because validation jobs passed when policy requires release approval.

---

### Local Environment Dependency

Release automation that only works on one maintainer workstation due to undocumented configuration.

---

## Minimum Automation Model

The minimum useful FamilyOS Release Automation should eventually provide:

```text id="5y8itx"
repository validation
version validation
candidate identification
required validation execution
tag conflict detection
safe tag creation
publication verification
```

Even partial automation should preserve framework semantics.

---

## Target Automation Experience

At higher maturity, a FamilyOS maintainer may initiate a release and receive:

```text id="2w91aj"
FamilyOS Release

Candidate           6.0.0-rc.2
Profile             platform-stable

Readiness           PASS
Validation          PASS
Approval            GRANTED
Version             6.0.0
Artifacts           VERIFIED
Tag                 READY
Publication         READY

Executing publication...

Tag                 CREATED
Artifacts           PUBLISHED
Release Notes       PUBLISHED
Stable Channel      UPDATED
Verification        PASS
Evidence            RECORDED

RELEASE COMPLETE
```

The result must remain backed by detailed observable state and evidence.

---

## Relationship With CI/CD Integration

`14-CI-CD-Integration.md` defines how Release Automation is executed inside CI/CD environments.

Automation architecture remains broader than any CI/CD implementation.

---

## Relationship With Versioning

`06-Versioning-Strategy.md` defines version semantics.

Automation may validate and calculate versions but must follow those rules.

---

## Relationship With Release Candidates

`10-Release-Candidates.md` defines candidate semantics.

Automation creates and manages candidate metadata according to those rules.

---

## Relationship With Release Validation

`12-Release-Validation.md` defines validation requirements.

Automation executes deterministic parts of validation and records evidence.

---

## Relationship With Tagging

`16-Tagging-and-Repository-State.md` defines authoritative repository tag semantics.

Automation must protect those semantics.

---

## Relationship With Publishing and Distribution

`17-Publishing-and-Distribution.md` defines publication rules.

Automation performs those operations within controlled boundaries.

---

## Relationship With Rollback and Recovery

`18-Rollback-and-Recovery.md` defines release recovery semantics.

Automation should provide state and mechanisms that make recovery safe.

---

## Relationship With Release Security

`19-Release-Security.md` defines security controls for release automation, credentials, artifacts, provenance, and authorization.

---

## Relationship With Release Observability

`20-Release-Observability.md` defines how automation state, events, evidence, and failures become visible.

---

## Relationship With Release Governance

`21-Release-Governance.md` defines approval and authority.

Automation must implement those boundaries rather than bypass them.

---

## Final Statement

The FamilyOS Release Automation model establishes automation as a controlled execution layer for release engineering.

It enables FamilyOS to replace repetitive manual release procedures with deterministic, observable, idempotent, recoverable, and increasingly policy-driven workflows while preserving human governance and architectural clarity.

Release automation must make correct release processes easier to execute.

It must never make incorrect or undocumented release processes faster.
