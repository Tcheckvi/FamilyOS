# Release Framework

## EPIC-REL-001

### Release Framework

### Overview

EPIC-REL-001 — Release Framework establishes the official release engineering foundation for the FamilyOS ecosystem.

The framework defines how FamilyOS software, platform components, official plugins, documentation, specifications, and other releasable artifacts progress from validated build outputs to controlled, identifiable, traceable, publishable, and recoverable releases.

A release is not considered a simple publication operation.

Within FamilyOS, a release is a governed engineering transition that converts a validated set of artifacts and repository state into an officially identifiable platform state.

The Release Framework therefore establishes the principles, lifecycle, architecture, controls, evidence, automation, governance, and operational mechanisms required to perform releases consistently across the ecosystem.

---

## Purpose

The Release Framework provides the foundation required to:

* define the FamilyOS release model;
* establish release engineering principles;
* define the complete release lifecycle;
* standardize versioning across releasable components;
* define release types and release channels;
* establish release planning and readiness requirements;
* govern release candidate creation and promotion;
* preserve artifact provenance and integrity;
* establish release validation requirements;
* automate repeatable release operations;
* integrate releases with CI/CD workflows;
* standardize changelogs and release notes;
* govern repository tags and release states;
* define publishing and distribution mechanisms;
* establish rollback and recovery expectations;
* integrate security into release operations;
* provide release observability and traceability;
* define release governance and compliance requirements;
* establish release metrics and risk management;
* support controlled evolution of the Release Framework itself.

The framework transforms release management from an isolated publication activity into a permanent engineering capability.

---

## Release Engineering Definition

For FamilyOS, release engineering is the discipline responsible for controlling the transition between validated engineering outputs and officially consumable platform states.

Release engineering includes:

```text
validated source state
        ↓
validated build outputs
        ↓
release readiness
        ↓
release candidate
        ↓
release validation
        ↓
approval
        ↓
version assignment
        ↓
repository tagging
        ↓
publication
        ↓
distribution
        ↓
observation
        ↓
maintenance / rollback / recovery
```

Every significant transition must be deterministic where possible, observable where necessary, and supported by sufficient evidence to reconstruct what was released, why it was released, and from which source state it originated.

---

## Scope

The Release Framework covers:

* release architecture;
* release lifecycle;
* versioning strategy;
* release types;
* release channels;
* release planning;
* release readiness;
* release candidates;
* release artifact identity;
* artifact provenance;
* release validation;
* release automation;
* CI/CD integration;
* changelog management;
* release notes;
* Git tagging;
* repository release state;
* publishing;
* distribution;
* rollback;
* recovery;
* release security;
* release observability;
* release governance;
* release compliance;
* release metrics;
* release risk management;
* framework lifecycle management.

The framework applies to releasable FamilyOS assets where release semantics are required.

---

## Out of Scope

The Release Framework does not replace:

* source-code architecture;
* repository architecture;
* coding standards;
* testing frameworks;
* quality frameworks;
* documentation frameworks;
* build implementation details;
* plugin architecture;
* deployment architecture;
* runtime operations;
* infrastructure management.

These concerns remain governed by their respective FamilyOS foundations and frameworks.

The Release Framework consumes evidence and outputs from those systems and governs their transition into official releases.

---

## Relationship With the Build Framework

EPIC-BLD-001 — Build Framework and EPIC-REL-001 — Release Framework define separate but adjacent engineering responsibilities.

The Build Framework answers:

> How does FamilyOS transform a controlled source state into reproducible and verifiable artifacts?

The Release Framework answers:

> How does FamilyOS transform validated artifacts into an officially versioned, governed, traceable, publishable, and recoverable release?

The relationship is:

```text
Source
  │
  ▼
Build Framework
  │
  ├── reproducible build
  ├── validated artifacts
  ├── build metadata
  └── provenance evidence
  │
  ▼
Release Framework
  │
  ├── readiness
  ├── candidate qualification
  ├── versioning
  ├── approval
  ├── tagging
  ├── publishing
  ├── distribution
  └── recovery
  │
  ▼
Official FamilyOS Release
```

A successful build does not automatically constitute a release.

A release may only consume artifacts that satisfy the applicable build, testing, quality, security, and governance requirements.

---

## Relationship With the Testing Framework

EPIC-TST-001 — Testing Framework defines how software behavior is verified.

The Release Framework consumes testing evidence as part of release readiness and release validation.

Testing evidence may include:

* unit test results;
* integration test results;
* system test results;
* contract test results;
* regression test results;
* performance test results;
* compatibility test results;
* release-specific verification results.

A release candidate must not bypass mandatory testing requirements.

---

## Relationship With the Quality Framework

EPIC-QLT-001 — Quality Framework defines the quality expectations and quality controls applicable across FamilyOS engineering.

The Release Framework integrates those expectations into release readiness and release gates.

Release decisions must therefore consider:

* quality status;
* unresolved defects;
* quality debt;
* quality gate results;
* known limitations;
* validation evidence;
* release risk.

Release approval must be evidence-based rather than assumption-based.

---

## Relationship With the Documentation Framework

EPIC-DOC-001 — Documentation Framework governs FamilyOS documentation architecture, lifecycle, quality, traceability, and publishing expectations.

The Release Framework depends on documentation for:

* changelogs;
* release notes;
* migration guidance;
* compatibility information;
* known limitations;
* operational instructions;
* release evidence;
* historical traceability.

Documentation required by a release is part of release readiness.

Documentation must not be treated as an optional activity performed after publication.

---

## Relationship With Plugin Governance

FamilyOS official plugins are governed by the platform plugin architecture and applicable plugin compliance mechanisms.

The Release Framework establishes common release semantics for plugin releases, including:

* version identity;
* release readiness;
* compatibility;
* validation;
* provenance;
* release notes;
* tagging;
* publication;
* distribution;
* rollback considerations.

Plugin-specific requirements may extend the Release Framework but must not weaken mandatory platform release controls.

---

## Relationship With Security

Security is integrated throughout the release lifecycle.

Release engineering must protect:

* source-to-release integrity;
* artifact integrity;
* provenance information;
* release credentials;
* publishing permissions;
* signing mechanisms where applicable;
* CI/CD release environments;
* repository tags;
* release metadata;
* distribution channels.

A release process that cannot establish reasonable confidence in artifact identity and origin must not be considered trustworthy.

---

## Release Framework Objectives

The Release Framework establishes the following primary objectives.

### O1 — Deterministic Release Identity

Every official release must have an unambiguous identity.

The identity must allow engineers and automation to determine exactly which release is being referenced.

---

### O2 — Source Traceability

Every official release must be traceable to a specific controlled repository state.

The relationship between source state, build artifacts, release candidate, version, and final release must be reconstructable.

---

### O3 — Artifact Provenance

Release artifacts must preserve sufficient provenance information to determine how and from which inputs they were produced.

---

### O4 — Controlled Promotion

Artifacts must progress through defined release states.

Promotion must occur according to explicit criteria rather than arbitrary publication decisions.

---

### O5 — Evidence-Based Readiness

Release readiness must be demonstrated using objective evidence.

Evidence may originate from:

* builds;
* tests;
* quality checks;
* compliance checks;
* documentation validation;
* security controls;
* release-specific validation.

---

### O6 — Reproducible Operations

Release operations should be automated and reproducible wherever practical.

Manual steps must be explicit, controlled, and auditable when automation is not appropriate.

---

### O7 — Safe Publication

Publishing operations must protect release integrity and prevent accidental, incomplete, unauthorized, or ambiguous releases.

---

### O8 — Recoverability

FamilyOS must define how releases can be withdrawn, superseded, rolled back, or otherwise recovered from when release failures occur.

---

### O9 — Observability

The state and outcome of release operations must be observable.

Failures must provide sufficient information for diagnosis and recovery.

---

### O10 — Governance

Release authority, responsibilities, exceptions, and approval requirements must be explicitly governed.

---

## Core Release Principles

The following principles are normative for the FamilyOS Release Framework.

### Principle 1 — Build Is Not Release

A successful build does not constitute an official release.

Release qualification is a separate lifecycle stage.

---

### Principle 2 — Every Release Has an Identity

Official releases must have explicit and stable version identities.

Ambiguous releases are prohibited.

---

### Principle 3 — Every Release Has a Source State

An official release must map to an identifiable source repository state.

---

### Principle 4 — Every Release Has Evidence

Release approval must be supported by validation evidence appropriate to the release type and risk.

---

### Principle 5 — Promotion Is Controlled

Release candidates must progress through defined states and gates.

---

### Principle 6 — Published Artifacts Are Immutable

Published release artifacts should be treated as immutable.

Corrections should normally produce a new release rather than silently modifying an existing published release.

---

### Principle 7 — Version Meaning Must Be Stable

Version identifiers must have consistent semantics across the ecosystem.

---

### Principle 8 — Automation Is Preferred

Repeatable release operations should be automated.

Automation reduces procedural drift and improves reproducibility.

---

### Principle 9 — Manual Authority Remains Governed

Automation does not eliminate governance.

Actions requiring explicit human authority must remain subject to defined approval rules.

---

### Principle 10 — Release Failure Is Expected

The release architecture must assume that failures can occur.

Rollback, recovery, supersession, and incident handling must therefore be designed before they are needed.

---

### Principle 11 — Security Is Continuous

Security controls apply throughout the release lifecycle and not only at publication time.

---

### Principle 12 — Traceability Must Survive the Release

Release metadata and evidence must remain useful after publication.

Historical releases must remain reconstructable to the extent required by platform governance.

---

## Release Lifecycle Model

The canonical FamilyOS release lifecycle consists of the following conceptual stages:

```text
PLAN
  │
  ▼
PREPARE
  │
  ▼
ASSESS READINESS
  │
  ▼
CREATE CANDIDATE
  │
  ▼
VALIDATE
  │
  ▼
APPROVE
  │
  ▼
VERSION
  │
  ▼
TAG
  │
  ▼
PUBLISH
  │
  ▼
DISTRIBUTE
  │
  ▼
OBSERVE
  │
  ▼
MAINTAIN / RECOVER
```

Specific release types may refine these stages.

They must not bypass mandatory controls without an explicitly governed exception.

---

## Release States

The framework recognizes the need for explicit release states.

A canonical model may include:

```text
planned
prepared
candidate
validated
approved
released
published
superseded
withdrawn
failed
```

The precise state model and transition rules are defined by the Release Lifecycle and Release Architecture documents.

State transitions must be explicit enough to support both human governance and automation.

---

## Versioning Model

FamilyOS releases require a consistent versioning strategy.

Versioning must communicate meaningful compatibility and evolution information.

The framework establishes requirements for:

* version identifiers;
* version increments;
* pre-release identifiers;
* release candidate identifiers;
* stable releases;
* patch releases;
* minor releases;
* major releases;
* compatibility expectations;
* exceptional version transitions.

The authoritative rules are defined in `06-Versioning-Strategy.md`.

---

## Release Types

The framework recognizes that not every release has the same purpose or risk profile.

Release types may include:

* development releases;
* preview releases;
* alpha releases;
* beta releases;
* release candidates;
* stable releases;
* patch releases;
* maintenance releases;
* security releases;
* emergency releases.

Each type may have different qualification requirements while remaining governed by the common Release Framework.

---

## Release Channels

FamilyOS may expose releases through controlled channels.

Possible channels include:

```text
development
preview
candidate
stable
maintenance
```

Channels must not create ambiguity about release stability or support expectations.

Promotion between channels must follow defined rules.

---

## Release Readiness

A release must satisfy defined readiness requirements before promotion.

Readiness may include:

* repository state verification;
* successful build evidence;
* testing completion;
* quality gate completion;
* security checks;
* compliance checks;
* documentation readiness;
* changelog readiness;
* release notes readiness;
* compatibility assessment;
* unresolved defect assessment;
* artifact verification;
* risk assessment.

Readiness requirements may vary according to release type and risk but must remain explicit.

---

## Release Candidates

A release candidate represents a specific release configuration submitted for final qualification.

A release candidate must be sufficiently immutable to ensure that the object being validated is the same object being considered for publication.

Changes introduced after candidate validation normally require a new candidate or renewed validation.

Release candidate semantics are defined in `10-Release-Candidates.md`.

---

## Artifact Integrity and Provenance

Release artifacts must be associated with sufficient information to establish:

* artifact identity;
* version;
* source revision;
* build origin;
* build environment where relevant;
* dependency context where relevant;
* validation status;
* publication state.

Where appropriate, integrity mechanisms such as checksums, signatures, attestations, or equivalent controls may be used.

The Release Framework does not mandate a specific cryptographic implementation at this architectural stage unless another FamilyOS standard requires one.

---

## Release Validation

Release validation verifies that the candidate intended for publication satisfies applicable release requirements.

Validation may include:

* artifact inspection;
* version verification;
* metadata verification;
* provenance verification;
* repository state verification;
* automated test evidence;
* quality evidence;
* security evidence;
* compliance evidence;
* documentation verification;
* installation verification;
* upgrade verification;
* rollback verification;
* publication simulation.

Release validation must operate on the actual candidate whenever technically possible.

---

## Release Automation

Release automation should provide repeatable mechanisms for:

* candidate preparation;
* version calculation;
* validation;
* metadata generation;
* changelog generation;
* tag preparation;
* artifact publication;
* release creation;
* evidence collection;
* post-release verification.

Automation must fail safely.

A failed release automation workflow must not silently leave the repository or distribution systems in an ambiguous release state.

---

## CI/CD Integration

Release workflows may integrate with continuous integration and continuous delivery systems.

CI/CD integration must preserve:

* separation between validation and publication where required;
* permission boundaries;
* release evidence;
* traceability;
* deterministic inputs;
* controlled credentials;
* observable failure states.

Continuous delivery capability does not imply uncontrolled continuous publication.

---

## Changelog and Release Notes

Every significant release must provide appropriate information describing what changed.

The framework distinguishes between:

**Changelog**

A structured historical record of changes across versions.

**Release Notes**

A release-specific communication artifact describing the release, significant changes, compatibility implications, known limitations, and relevant operational information.

Both must remain traceable to the corresponding release identity.

---

## Repository Tags

Repository tags are part of the FamilyOS release identity and traceability model.

Tags used for official releases must:

* follow defined naming conventions;
* identify the intended repository state;
* be created deliberately;
* be verifiable;
* avoid ambiguous reuse;
* remain stable after publication.

Official release tags must not be casually moved or overwritten.

The authoritative tagging rules are defined in `16-Tagging-and-Repository-State.md`.

---

## Publishing and Distribution

Publishing makes a qualified release available through an official release mechanism.

Distribution makes the published release available to its intended consumers.

The Release Framework separates these concepts because publication and distribution may occur through different systems and at different times.

Publishing operations must preserve:

* artifact identity;
* version identity;
* metadata;
* integrity;
* provenance;
* access control;
* release evidence.

---

## Rollback and Recovery

Every release architecture must consider failure after publication.

Recovery mechanisms may include:

* withdrawal;
* supersession;
* rollback;
* corrective release;
* emergency patch;
* channel demotion;
* distribution suspension.

Rollback must not be assumed to be universally possible.

Where rollback cannot safely restore the previous state, forward recovery must be defined.

---

## Release Security

Release security protects the release pipeline and released artifacts from unauthorized or unintended modification.

Security considerations include:

* release permissions;
* credential management;
* repository protection;
* tag protection;
* artifact integrity;
* provenance;
* CI/CD isolation;
* publishing authority;
* dependency trust;
* release evidence integrity.

Security controls should be proportional to the release risk and ecosystem maturity.

---

## Release Observability

Release operations must generate enough information to determine:

* what operation occurred;
* which release was involved;
* when the operation occurred;
* which state transition occurred;
* whether the operation succeeded;
* what failed if it did not succeed;
* which evidence was generated;
* what recovery action may be required.

Observability must support both automation and engineering diagnosis.

---

## Release Governance

Release governance defines:

* release authority;
* approval responsibilities;
* mandatory gates;
* exception handling;
* emergency release authority;
* release ownership;
* evidence requirements;
* policy evolution.

No automation system may implicitly redefine governance by bypassing required approval or validation rules.

---

## Release Compliance

Release compliance evaluates whether release activities conform to applicable FamilyOS policies, frameworks, specifications, and governance requirements.

Compliance evidence may be produced automatically where possible.

Non-compliance must result in one of the following:

```text
BLOCK
REMEDIATE
EXPLICITLY ACCEPT UNDER GOVERNANCE
```

Silent non-compliance is not an acceptable release strategy.

---

## Release Metrics

Release metrics provide evidence about the effectiveness and reliability of release engineering.

Potential metrics include:

* release frequency;
* release success rate;
* failed release rate;
* candidate rejection rate;
* release lead time;
* validation duration;
* rollback frequency;
* recovery time;
* emergency release frequency;
* release automation coverage;
* release evidence completeness.

Metrics must support engineering improvement rather than become isolated targets detached from system quality.

---

## Release Risk Management

Every release introduces some degree of change and therefore some degree of risk.

Release risk management considers:

* scope of change;
* affected components;
* compatibility impact;
* security impact;
* migration complexity;
* operational impact;
* reversibility;
* validation coverage;
* unresolved defects;
* dependency changes;
* distribution scope.

Higher-risk releases may require stronger evidence and approval.

---

## Normative Architecture

The canonical documentation architecture for EPIC-REL-001 is:

```text

## Normative Language

The keywords:

* MUST;
* MUST NOT;
* REQUIRED;
* SHALL;
* SHALL NOT;
* SHOULD;
* SHOULD NOT;
* MAY;

are to be interpreted as normative requirement levels when used in a requirements context.

Descriptive sections provide architectural context.

Normative requirements establish mandatory or recommended FamilyOS release behavior.

---

## Expected Outcome

After implementation of EPIC-REL-001, FamilyOS will possess a formal release engineering capability connecting its existing engineering foundations into a controlled release process.

The resulting engineering chain becomes:

```text
Architecture
    ↓
Implementation
    ↓
Build
    ↓
Testing
    ↓
Quality
    ↓
Compliance
    ↓
Release Readiness
    ↓
Release Candidate
    ↓
Release Validation
    ↓
Approval
    ↓
Version + Tag
    ↓
Publication
    ↓
Distribution
    ↓
Observation
    ↓
Recovery / Evolution
```

This establishes a release process that is:

* repeatable;
* traceable;
* evidence-based;
* secure;
* automatable;
* observable;
* governable;
* recoverable;
* compatible with long-term platform evolution.

---

## Final Statement

EPIC-REL-001 establishes release engineering as a first-class FamilyOS platform capability.

The framework ensures that an official FamilyOS release is not defined merely by the existence of compiled or packaged artifacts.

A FamilyOS release is a controlled engineering state backed by validated artifacts, explicit version identity, repository traceability, release evidence, governance, documentation, and recovery mechanisms.

This framework provides the foundation required for FamilyOS to evolve from successful engineering outputs to reliable, reproducible, and trustworthy software releases.
