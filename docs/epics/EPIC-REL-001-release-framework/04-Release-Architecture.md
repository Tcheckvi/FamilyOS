# Release Framework

## 04 Release Architecture

### Overview

EPIC-REL-001 — Release Framework defines a release architecture that governs how FamilyOS moves from validated engineering outputs to officially identifiable, publishable, traceable, and recoverable releases.

The Release Architecture provides the structural model required to organize:

* release preparation;
* release readiness;
* release candidates;
* release validation;
* versioning;
* approvals;
* repository state;
* tagging;
* artifacts;
* provenance;
* publication;
* distribution;
* observability;
* recovery;
* governance;
* compliance.

The architecture separates release semantics from implementation technology.

It defines what responsibilities must exist before defining which tools execute them.

---

## Architectural Objective

The objective of the Release Architecture is to establish a reusable release model that can support:

* FamilyOS framework releases;
* CLI releases;
* platform releases;
* official plugin releases;
* documentation releases;
* specification releases;
* future SDK releases;
* future package releases;
* future distributed release targets.

The architecture must remain valid as FamilyOS evolves.

---

## Architectural Boundary

The Release Framework begins when sufficiently validated engineering outputs are available for release qualification.

The Release Framework ends when a release has reached a defined completed operational state.

Conceptually:

```text
Engineering Outputs
        ↓
Release Boundary
        ↓
Release Preparation
        ↓
Release Qualification
        ↓
Release Publication
        ↓
Release Verification
        ↓
Release Completion
```

The Release Framework does not own the production of every input it consumes.

Instead, it integrates evidence produced by other FamilyOS frameworks.

---

## Upstream Inputs

The Release Architecture consumes inputs from several engineering domains.

These may include:

```text
Source Repository
Build Framework
Testing Framework
Quality Framework
Documentation Framework
Plugin Compliance Framework
Security Controls
Architecture Decisions
Specifications
```

Each upstream system remains responsible for its own domain.

The Release Framework consumes their results as release evidence.

---

## Downstream Outputs

The Release Architecture produces controlled release outputs.

These may include:

* official release identity;
* version;
* release tag;
* release artifacts;
* release metadata;
* release notes;
* changelog entries;
* provenance information;
* publication state;
* distribution state;
* release evidence;
* release history;
* recovery information.

---

## Canonical Release Architecture

The conceptual architecture is:

```text
                    ┌────────────────────────────┐
                    │      Source Repository      │
                    └─────────────┬──────────────┘
                                  │
                                  ▼
                    ┌────────────────────────────┐
                    │       Build Framework       │
                    └─────────────┬──────────────┘
                                  │
                                  ▼
                    ┌────────────────────────────┐
                    │     Validated Artifacts     │

                    ┌────────────────────────────┐

                                  │
                                  ▼
                    ┌────────────────────────────┐
                    │     Release Readiness       │
                    └─────────────┬──────────────┘
                                  │
                                  ▼
                    ┌────────────────────────────┐
                    │     Release Candidate       │
                    └─────────────┬──────────────┘
                                  │
                                  ▼
                    ┌────────────────────────────┐
                    │     Release Validation      │
                    └─────────────┬──────────────┘
                                  │
                                  ▼
                    ┌────────────────────────────┐
                    │    Release Governance       │
                    │   Approval / Exceptions     │
                    └─────────────┬──────────────┘
                                  │
                                  ▼
                    ┌────────────────────────────┐
                    │ Version + Repository Anchor │
                    └─────────────┬──────────────┘
                                  │
                                  ▼
                    ┌────────────────────────────┐
                    │        Publication          │
                    └─────────────┬──────────────┘
                                  │
                                  ▼
                    ┌────────────────────────────┐
                    │        Distribution         │
                    └─────────────┬──────────────┘
                                  │
                                  ▼
                    ┌────────────────────────────┐
                    │ Post-Release Verification   │
                    └─────────────┬──────────────┘
                                  │
                                  ▼
                    ┌────────────────────────────┐
                    │ Observation / Recovery      │
                    └────────────────────────────┘
```

This architecture describes responsibilities, not necessarily separate software services.

---

## Architectural Domains

The Release Architecture is divided into several domains.

```text
Release Architecture
├── Preparation
├── Readiness
├── Candidate Management
├── Validation
├── Versioning
├── Repository State
├── Artifact Management
├── Provenance
├── Governance
├── Publication
├── Distribution
├── Observability
├── Recovery
├── Compliance
└── Evidence
```

Each domain has a specific responsibility.

---

## Release Preparation Domain

The Release Preparation domain prepares a change set for release qualification.

Responsibilities include:

* determining intended release scope;
* identifying candidate components;
* verifying expected branch or source lineage;
* determining version intent;
* preparing release documentation;
* identifying required artifacts;
* identifying required validation;
* establishing release type;
* identifying release channel;
* preparing release metadata.

The output of preparation is not yet an approved release.

It is a release-ready input for formal readiness evaluation.

---

## Release Readiness Domain

The Release Readiness domain determines whether a proposed release has sufficient evidence to become a release candidate.

Readiness consumes evidence from multiple systems.

Conceptually:

```text
Build Evidence
Test Evidence
Quality Evidence
Security Evidence
Compliance Evidence
Documentation Evidence
Repository Evidence
Risk Evidence
        ↓
Release Readiness Evaluation
        ↓
PASS / BLOCK / EXCEPTION REQUIRED
```

Readiness must remain separate from publication.

---

## Release Candidate Domain

The Release Candidate domain defines the exact object submitted for final release validation.

A release candidate may consist of:

```text
ReleaseCandidate
├── candidate identifier
├── intended version
├── release type
├── release channel
├── source revision
├── build identity
├── artifact inventory
├── provenance metadata
├── validation scope
└── release metadata
```

A candidate must be stable enough that validation results remain meaningful.

---

## Candidate Identity

Each release candidate should have a distinct identity.

An example conceptual model is:

```text
v4.8.0-rc.1
v4.8.0-rc.2
v4.8.0
```

The exact naming rules are defined by the Versioning Strategy and Release Candidate documents.

Candidate identity must distinguish different candidate states.

---

## Release Validation Domain

The Release Validation domain validates the actual candidate intended for publication.

Its responsibilities may include:

* artifact verification;
* metadata verification;
* version verification;
* source verification;
* provenance verification;
* installation checks;
* upgrade checks;
* compatibility checks;
* packaging checks;
* documentation checks;
* final test verification;
* security verification;
* compliance verification.

Release validation must not rely solely on assumptions about previous pipeline stages.

---

## Versioning Domain

The Versioning domain determines valid release identifiers.

Responsibilities include:

* version syntax;
* version semantics;
* increment rules;
* pre-release semantics;
* candidate versions;
* release type relationships;
* compatibility implications;
* duplicate prevention.

The versioning system must provide stable meaning across FamilyOS releases.

---

## Repository State Domain

The Repository State domain ensures that release identity maps correctly to repository state.

Responsibilities include:

* branch verification;
* HEAD verification;
* clean working tree checks;
* remote synchronization checks;
* tag uniqueness;
* tag creation;
* tag immutability expectations;
* source revision recording.

Conceptually:

```text
Branch
   ↓
HEAD
   ↓
Commit
   ↓
Release Tag
   ↓
Release Version
```

This relationship must remain traceable.

---

## Artifact Domain

The Artifact domain represents the exact files or packages included in a release.

Artifacts may include:

* source archives;
* package files;
* binaries;
* container images;
* plugin packages;
* documentation bundles;
* generated metadata;
* release manifests.

Each artifact should have sufficient identity.

---

## Artifact Inventory

A release should be able to describe its artifact set.

Example conceptual model:

```text
ReleaseArtifactSet
├── familyos-cli package
├── source archive
├── plugin packages
├── documentation archive
└── release metadata
```

Artifact inventories enable verification and recovery.

---

## Artifact Identity

Artifact identity should not depend solely on filenames.

An artifact may be identified by:

* release version;
* component name;
* artifact type;
* checksum;
* build identifier;
* source revision;
* platform or architecture.

This provides stronger traceability than filename matching alone.

---

## Provenance Domain

The Provenance domain establishes the origin of release artifacts.

The expected traceability model is:

```text
Source Revision
      ↓
Build Context
      ↓
Build Artifact
      ↓
Release Candidate
      ↓
Official Release
```

Provenance may include:

* commit identity;
* build identifier;
* build environment metadata;
* dependency information;
* checksums;
* signatures;
* attestations.

The architecture supports progressive provenance maturity.

---

## Evidence Domain

The Release Evidence domain aggregates information required to justify and reconstruct release decisions.

A conceptual evidence model is:

```text
ReleaseEvidence
├── source evidence
├── build evidence
├── test evidence
├── quality evidence
├── security evidence
├── compliance evidence
├── documentation evidence
├── approval evidence
├── publication evidence
└── recovery evidence
```

Evidence may originate from multiple systems.

The Release Framework provides the logical aggregation boundary.

---

## Governance Domain

The Governance domain controls release authority.

It defines responsibility for:

* release initiation;
* readiness approval;
* risk acceptance;
* release approval;
* version authorization;
* tag authorization;
* publication authority;
* exception approval;
* withdrawal;
* emergency releases.

Governance exists independently from technical capability.

A user or automation token may technically have permission to publish while still lacking organizational authorization under release policy.

---

## Approval Architecture

Approval may exist at multiple points.

A conceptual model is:

```text
Readiness Approval
        ↓
Candidate Validation
        ↓
Release Approval
        ↓
Publication Authorization
```

Not every release profile requires separate human actions at each stage.

The architecture allows profiles to combine or automate approvals where policy permits.

---

## Exception Architecture

Release exceptions must be explicit.

A conceptual exception record may contain:

```text
ReleaseException
├── requirement
├── reason
├── release scope
├── risk
├── compensating controls
├── approver
└── expiration
```

An exception changes the applicable release decision.

It does not silently redefine release policy.

---

## Publication Domain

The Publication domain transitions an approved candidate into an official published release.

Publication may involve:

* creating an official Git tag;
* creating a repository release object;
* uploading artifacts;
* publishing packages;
* publishing release metadata;
* publishing release notes;
* publishing documentation.

Publication operations create externally visible side effects and therefore require strong controls.

---

## Publication Boundary

Publication represents an important architectural boundary.

Before publication:

```text
candidate may still be rejected
```

After publication:

```text
release identity may already be externally consumed
```

Therefore, destructive or externally visible operations should occur as late as practical after validation.

---

## Distribution Domain

Distribution is separate from publication.

Publication answers:

> Has the release been made authoritative?

Distribution answers:

> Has the release been made available to intended consumers?

A conceptual flow is:

```text
Candidate
    ↓
Approved
    ↓
Published
    ↓
Verified
    ↓
Distributed
```

This distinction supports future staged release models.

---

## Channel Architecture

Release channels represent controlled availability or stability classifications.

Conceptually:

```text
development
    ↓
preview
    ↓
candidate
    ↓
stable
```

or separately:

```text
maintenance
```

The exact channel model may differ by release profile.

Channels must remain explicit and governed.

---

## Promotion Architecture

Promotion changes release availability or stability state.

The preferred architecture promotes already validated artifacts.

```text
Validated Artifact
      ↓
Candidate Channel
      ↓
Stable Channel
```

The system should avoid unnecessary artifact rebuilding between promotion stages.

---

## Observability Domain

The Observability domain makes release state understandable.

It should expose information about:

* preparation;
* readiness;
* candidate creation;
* validation;
* approval;
* versioning;
* tag creation;
* publication;
* distribution;
* completion;
* failure;
* recovery.

Observability supports humans, automation, and governance.

---

## Release Events

The architecture may eventually expose release lifecycle events.

Examples include:

```text
release.prepared
release.readiness.passed
release.candidate.created
release.validation.passed
release.approved
release.tag.created
release.published
release.distributed
release.completed
release.failed
release.withdrawn
release.superseded
```

These event names are conceptual and not yet an implementation contract.

---

## Recovery Domain

The Recovery domain handles defective, interrupted, or failed releases.

Recovery mechanisms may include:

* retry;
* rollback;
* withdrawal;
* supersession;
* corrective release;
* forward recovery;
* publication cleanup;
* channel demotion.

Recovery must account for already completed external side effects.

---

## Failure State Architecture

A release may fail at multiple stages.

```text
Preparation Failure
Readiness Failure
Validation Failure
Approval Failure
Tagging Failure
Publication Failure
Distribution Failure
Verification Failure
```

These are not equivalent failures.

The architecture must preserve enough state to determine the appropriate recovery path.

---

## Partial Publication Architecture

A release may interact with multiple publication targets.

Example:

```text
Git Tag              PASS
Repository Release   PASS
Artifact Registry    FAIL
Documentation        NOT STARTED
```

This state must not be represented as simple success or failure without context.

The release evidence model should preserve per-target publication state.

---

## Release State Model

The Release Architecture requires explicit lifecycle states.

A canonical conceptual state model is:

```text
PLANNED
   ↓
PREPARED
   ↓
READY
   ↓
CANDIDATE
   ↓
VALIDATED
   ↓
APPROVED
   ↓
RELEASED
   ↓
PUBLISHED
   ↓
DISTRIBUTED
   ↓
COMPLETED
```

Additional terminal or exceptional states may include:

```text
BLOCKED
FAILED
WITHDRAWN
SUPERSEDED
ROLLED_BACK
```

The authoritative lifecycle is defined in `05-Release-Lifecycle.md`.

---

## Release Entity Model

The Release Framework may eventually implement explicit domain entities.

Conceptually:

```text
Release
├── ReleaseIdentity
├── ReleaseVersion
├── ReleaseCandidate
├── ReleaseArtifactSet
├── ReleaseEvidence
├── ReleaseApproval
├── ReleasePublication
├── ReleaseChannel
└── ReleaseRecovery
```

These concepts should remain separate even if early tooling represents them using simple files or scripts.

---

## Release Identity Model

A release identity may combine:

```text
component
version
release type
channel
source state
```

The minimum identity should remain simple enough for practical use.

The framework should avoid creating unnecessarily complex identifiers.

---

## Release Manifest

A future release may use a machine-readable manifest.

Conceptually:

```text
release:
  component: familyos
  version: 4.8.0
  type: stable

source:
  revision: abcdef1234

artifacts:
  - familyos-cli
  - source-archive

validation:
  status: passed

publication:
  status: published
```

This example is illustrative.

The final schema, if introduced, must be governed separately.

---

## Architectural Separation of Concerns

The Release Architecture must prevent responsibility duplication.

The intended ownership model is:

```text
Build Framework
    owns artifact production

Testing Framework
    owns testing methodology

Quality Framework
    owns quality governance

Documentation Framework
    owns documentation architecture

Plugin Compliance Framework
    owns plugin compliance evaluation

Release Framework
    owns release qualification and transition
```

The Release Framework consumes outputs from these domains without redefining them.

---

## Architecture vs Workflow

Release architecture defines stable responsibilities.

Release workflow defines ordered execution.

For example:

```text
Architecture:
Release validation must exist.

Workflow:
Run release validation after candidate creation.
```

This distinction allows workflows to evolve while preserving architectural requirements.

---

## Architecture vs Automation

Release automation implements architecture.

For example:

```text
Architecture requirement:
official tags must reference validated source state.

Automation implementation:
shell script / CI job verifies HEAD before tag creation.
```

The architectural requirement remains valid even if the implementation changes.

---

## Architecture vs Governance

Architecture defines where authority is required.

Governance defines who possesses that authority.

Example:

```text
Architecture:
release approval required.

Governance:
maintainer group may approve stable releases.
```

This separation allows governance models to evolve independently.

---

## Architecture vs Policy

Architecture defines capabilities and boundaries.

Policy defines mandatory behavior under specific circumstances.

Example:

```text
Architecture:
release validation capability exists.

Policy:
stable releases MUST pass validation.
```

Policies may vary by release profile.

---

## Architecture vs Release Profile

A release profile specializes the common architecture.

Example profiles may include:

```text
framework-release
plugin-release
platform-release
documentation-release
security-release
```

A profile may define different:

* validation requirements;
* evidence requirements;
* approval levels;
* publication targets;
* recovery expectations.

Profiles must preserve common release semantics.

---

## Framework Release Architecture

The current FamilyOS engineering frameworks themselves use a release workflow.

A framework release may involve:

```text
Documentation Complete
        ↓
Framework Validation
        ↓
Repository Verification
        ↓
Commit
        ↓
Version
        ↓
Annotated Tag
        ↓
Push Branch
        ↓
Push Tag
        ↓
Final Verification
```

This workflow represents an early practical implementation of the broader Release Architecture.

---

## Plugin Release Architecture

A plugin release may require additional information.

Conceptually:

```text
Plugin Source
    ↓
Plugin Build
    ↓
Plugin Tests
    ↓
Plugin Compliance
    ↓
Platform Compatibility
    ↓
Plugin Candidate
    ↓
Plugin Release
```

The common release domains remain reusable.

---

## Platform Release Architecture

A platform release may aggregate multiple components.

Conceptually:

```text
Core Version
Plugin Versions
Documentation Version
Specification State
Compatibility Matrix
        ↓
Platform Candidate
        ↓
Platform Validation
        ↓
Platform Release
```

The framework must support aggregation without requiring all components to use identical internal versioning.

---

## Release Dependency Architecture

Some releases may depend on other releases.

Examples include:

* plugin requires minimum platform version;
* CLI requires compatible schema;
* platform release references plugin versions;
* documentation corresponds to specific release.

These relationships should eventually become explicit release metadata.

---

## Compatibility Architecture

Compatibility evaluation may exist as part of readiness or candidate validation.

Conceptually:

```text
Candidate
   ↓
Compatibility Evaluation
   ├── platform
   ├── plugin
   ├── API
   ├── schema
   └── dependency
```

Compatibility rules must be defined by the relevant domain.

The Release Framework coordinates their release impact.

---

## Security Architecture

Release security applies across architectural boundaries.

Key controls may include:

```text
Source Protection
Branch Protection
CI/CD Isolation
Credential Protection
Artifact Integrity
Tag Protection
Publishing Permissions
Provenance
Audit Evidence
```

Security requirements must be layered rather than concentrated in a single release stage.

---

## Trust Boundaries

Release architecture introduces several trust boundaries.

Examples include:

```text
developer workstation
        ↓
source repository
        ↓
CI/CD environment
        ↓
artifact storage
        ↓
publication system
        ↓
consumer
```

Crossing a trust boundary may require:

* authentication;
* authorization;
* integrity verification;
* provenance verification;
* audit evidence.

---

## Release Control Plane

At higher maturity, FamilyOS may introduce a logical release control plane.

The control plane could manage:

* release state;
* release policies;
* release evidence;
* approvals;
* promotion;
* publication state;
* recovery state.

Conceptually:

```text
              Release Control Plane
           ┌──────────┬──────────┐
           │          │          │
           ▼          ▼          ▼
Repository        CI/CD      Registries
           │          │          │
           └──────────┴──────────┘
                      │
                      ▼
                 Release State
```

This is a future architecture direction, not an immediate implementation requirement.

---

## Release Data Plane

The release data plane represents the actual artifacts and metadata transferred during publication and distribution.

Examples include:

* binaries;
* packages;
* archives;
* plugin bundles;
* documentation artifacts;
* metadata files;
* release notes.

Control and data responsibilities should remain conceptually distinct.

---

## Policy Evaluation Layer

A future release architecture may contain a policy evaluation layer.

It may determine:

```text
candidate
   ↓
applicable release profile
   ↓
required policies
   ↓
policy evaluation
   ↓
PASS / BLOCK / EXCEPTION
```

This layer could integrate with future FamilyOS governance tooling.

---

## Release Orchestrator

A future Release Orchestrator may coordinate release operations.

Possible responsibilities include:

* loading release configuration;
* verifying readiness;
* creating candidate identity;
* invoking validation;
* requesting approval;
* assigning version;
* coordinating tagging;
* publishing artifacts;
* recording evidence;
* performing verification;
* initiating recovery.

The orchestrator should not contain undocumented policy.

It must execute framework-defined rules.

---

## CLI Architecture

A future FamilyOS CLI release interface may expose release operations.

Conceptually:

```text
familyos release prepare
familyos release check
familyos release candidate
familyos release validate
familyos release approve
familyos release publish
familyos release verify
familyos release inspect
familyos release recover
```

The CLI would be an interface to the release architecture, not the release architecture itself.

---

## Evidence Storage Architecture

Release evidence may initially exist across existing systems.

Future architecture may consolidate it.

Possible storage approaches include:

* repository files;
* CI/CD artifacts;
* release metadata;
* artifact registry metadata;
* dedicated evidence store.

The framework must avoid requiring a specific storage technology prematurely.

---

## Artifact Storage Architecture

Published artifacts may reside in:

* Git hosting releases;
* package registries;
* container registries;
* object storage;
* documentation hosting;
* plugin registries.

The Release Framework must treat these as publication targets behind common release semantics.

---

## Authoritative Release State

The architecture must eventually define what constitutes the authoritative release state.

Possible authoritative elements include:

```text
release tag
release metadata
artifact registry state
release evidence
```

No single technical provider should become implicitly authoritative without explicit framework definition.

---

## Architecture for Idempotency

Release operations should be designed to recognize existing state.

For example:

```text
tag already exists
→ verify it

artifact already exists
→ verify identity

release already published
→ verify state
```

instead of blindly repeating side effects.

This improves safe retry behavior.

---

## Architecture for Dry Runs

Where practical, release tooling should support validation before external side effects.

A future dry-run capability may verify:

* version calculation;
* release scope;
* tag name;
* artifact set;
* release notes;
* target repositories;
* policies.

This allows failures to occur before publication.

---

## Architecture for Atomicity

Perfect atomic publication may not always be possible.

The architecture should therefore seek one of two models:

```text
atomic publication
```

or:

```text
stateful multi-step publication with recovery
```

Stateless multi-step publication without recovery is unacceptable for mature release workflows.

---

## Architecture for Recovery

Recovery should use recorded release state.

Conceptually:

```text
Failure Detected
      ↓
Read Release State
      ↓
Determine Completed Side Effects
      ↓
Select Recovery Strategy
      ↓
Execute Recovery
      ↓
Verify Final State
```

Recovery must not depend only on operator memory.

---

## Architecture for Auditability

Significant release decisions should be reconstructable.

The architecture should eventually preserve:

* actor or automation identity;
* timestamps;
* approvals;
* policy results;
* exceptions;
* state transitions;
* publication results.

Auditability supports both security and governance.

---

## Architecture for Scalability

The architecture should support growth across several dimensions.

### More Releases

Release frequency may increase.

### More Components

The number of independently releasable components may increase.

### More Contributors

Release responsibility may be distributed among more maintainers.

### More Targets

Artifacts may be published to multiple systems.

### More Policies

Security, compliance, and compatibility requirements may become more sophisticated.

The architecture must scale without becoming dependent on one maintainer's operational knowledge.

---

## Architecture for Extensibility

Future capabilities should integrate through stable architectural interfaces.

Examples include:

* artifact signing;
* SBOM generation;
* attestation;
* progressive rollout;
* automated compatibility verification;
* policy-as-code;
* release dashboards;
* release scheduling.

These capabilities should extend existing domains rather than create unrelated release systems.

---

## Minimal Initial Architecture

The Release Framework can begin with a relatively small implementation.

A minimal FamilyOS release architecture may include:

```text
repository state validation
        ↓
test and quality evidence
        ↓
release readiness checklist
        ↓
version validation
        ↓
annotated Git tag
        ↓
push branch and tag
        ↓
verify remote state
```

This is sufficient to establish disciplined release behavior while more advanced capabilities are implemented incrementally.

---

## Intermediate Architecture

A more mature implementation may add:

```text
automated readiness checks
structured release metadata
candidate identity
artifact checksums
automated changelog generation
CI release validation
automated tag preparation
publication verification
```

---

## Advanced Architecture

A mature FamilyOS release platform may eventually provide:

```text
release policies
release profiles
release orchestrator
structured evidence
artifact signing
SBOM
attestations
multi-target publication
progressive distribution
automated rollback support
release dashboards
```

The architecture defined in EPIC-REL-001 must support this progression without fundamental redesign.

---

## Architectural Invariants

The following invariants are mandatory.

### A1 — Release and build responsibilities remain separate.

### A2 — Every release maps to an identifiable source state.

### A3 — Every release candidate has sufficient identity for validation.

### A4 — Release validation applies to the intended candidate.

### A5 — Published release identity remains stable.

### A6 — Version and repository release anchors remain consistent.

### A7 — Release authority remains governed.

### A8 — Publication side effects remain observable.

### A9 — Partial failure can be represented.

### A10 — Recovery remains possible through explicit release state.

### A11 — Evidence survives beyond transient execution where required.

### A12 — Implementation technology does not redefine release semantics.

---

## Architectural Anti-Patterns

The following patterns conflict with this architecture.

### Build Equals Release

Treating successful artifact generation as automatic release approval.

---

### Tag as Entire Release Model

Using tag creation as the only definition of release state.

---

### Unidentified Candidate

Validating artifacts without establishing which exact candidate they belong to.

---

### Pipeline-Owned Policy

Allowing CI/CD YAML to become the only source of release rules.

---

### Mutable Published Artifacts

Replacing release content under an existing official version.

---

### Hidden Publication State

Publishing to multiple systems without recording which operations completed.

---

### Monolithic Release Script

Combining readiness, validation, approval, versioning, tagging, publishing, and recovery into one opaque script with no explicit state boundaries.

---

### Provider-Locked Semantics

Defining the meaning of a FamilyOS release solely according to a hosting provider's release object.

---

## Architectural Decision Criteria

Future release design decisions should be evaluated against the following questions:

```text
Does this preserve release identity?

Does this preserve source traceability?

Does this validate the actual candidate?

Does this avoid duplicate responsibility?

Does this preserve governance?

Does this support automation?

Can failure state be diagnosed?

Can publication state be reconstructed?

Can recovery occur safely?

Can the mechanism evolve without changing release semantics?
```

A design that repeatedly fails these criteria should be reconsidered.

## Target Architectural State

The target FamilyOS release architecture is one in which the complete release chain is explicit:

```text
Source
  ↓
Build
  ↓
Artifact
  ↓
Readiness
  ↓
Candidate
  ↓
Validation
  ↓
Approval
  ↓
Version
  ↓
Tag
  ↓
Publication
  ↓
Distribution
  ↓
Verification
  ↓
Evidence
  ↓
Observation
  ↓
Recovery
```

No significant stage should exist only as undocumented operator knowledge.

---

## Final Statement

The FamilyOS Release Architecture establishes the structural foundation required to convert validated engineering outputs into trustworthy official releases.

It separates concerns, establishes release boundaries, identifies core domains, defines the relationship between candidates, artifacts, versions, repository state, governance, publication, and recovery, and provides a stable model for future automation.

The architecture ensures that FamilyOS release engineering can grow from disciplined manual workflows into a fully governed and automated release platform without losing traceability, security, clarity, or control.
