# Release Framework

## 29 Summary

### Overview

EPIC-REL-001 — Release Framework establishes the official release engineering foundation for the FamilyOS ecosystem.

The framework defines how FamilyOS prepares, qualifies, versions, approves, publishes, distributes, observes, secures, governs, and recovers releases.

Its purpose is to transform release activity from an informal sequence of repository and publication commands into a controlled engineering capability.

A FamilyOS release is therefore not defined only by:

* a successful build;
* a Git commit;
* a version number;
* a tag;
* an uploaded artifact.

An official release is the result of a governed lifecycle in which release identity, evidence, validation, authority, publication, and historical traceability remain coherent.

---

## Framework Objective

The Release Framework provides the architecture required to answer the following questions consistently:

```text id="iiwqbi"
What is being released?

Why is it being released?

Which source state produced it?

Which version identifies it?

Which candidate was validated?

Which artifacts belong to it?

Which evidence supports release readiness?

Who approved it?

Who was authorized to publish it?

Where was it published?

How was publication verified?

How can the release be recovered or withdrawn?

How can its history be reconstructed later?
```

These questions form the foundation of trustworthy release engineering.

---

## Core Release Model

The canonical FamilyOS release progression is:

```text id="7mj9wc"
PLANNED
   ↓
PREPARED
   ↓
READY
   ↓
CANDIDATE
   ↓
VALIDATED
   ↓
APPROVED
   ↓
RELEASED
   ↓
PUBLISHED
   ↓
DISTRIBUTED
   ↓
COMPLETED
```

Exceptional states may include:

```text id="r55ysf"
BLOCKED
FAILED
WITHDRAWN
SUPERSEDED
ROLLED_BACK
```

These states provide a stable model for both manual and automated release workflows.

---

## Release Is Not Build

One of the most important principles of EPIC-REL-001 is the separation between build and release.

The Build Framework answers:

```text id="gnezzu"
Can controlled source produce expected artifacts?
```

The Release Framework answers:

```text id="dnqe0l"
Should these exact outputs become an official FamilyOS release?
```

The relationship is:

```text id="mpspr5"
Source
   ↓
Build Framework
   ↓
Build Artifacts
   ↓
Release Framework
   ↓
Official Release
```

Successful build output is therefore a release input, not automatic release authorization.

---

## Release Identity

Every official release must have an explicit and stable identity.

Release identity is typically formed from:

```text id="69vr24"
release subject
version
source revision
release tag
```

where applicable.

The identity must remain unique and historically reconstructable.

The same official version must not intentionally refer to materially different release contents.

---

## Versioning Strategy

FamilyOS uses semantic version concepts as the default release version model.

The canonical structure is:

```text id="9bap5y"
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
```

Typical interpretation is:

```text id="52pogb"
MAJOR
incompatible or major architectural change

MINOR
backward-compatible capability evolution

PATCH
backward-compatible correction or maintenance
```

Pre-release identities may include:

```text id="xzf8vk"
alpha
beta
rc
```

such as:

```text id="h9lfm5"
5.2.0-rc.1
```

Version identity remains separate from Git tag identity.

---

## Release Tags

For Git-based releases, official tags create durable repository release anchors.

The expected relationship is:

```text id="ep97bz"
Release Version
      ↓
Official Tag
      ↓
Exact Git Commit
```

For FamilyOS framework milestones, a tag may follow:

```text id="8e1699"
v<version>-<release-subject>
```

for example:

```text id="0l3sgd"
v4.8.0-release-framework
```

Official published tags should be treated as immutable.

---

## Repository State

Release repository state must remain explicit.

For a typical FamilyOS framework release, the final expected relationship is:

```text id="09qyab"
Working Tree       CLEAN
HEAD               release commit
Remote Branch      release commit
Official Tag       release commit
Remote Tag         release commit
```

A release produced from uncommitted or ambiguous source state weakens traceability.

---

## Release Planning

Release Planning defines what the release is intended to become.

Planning identifies:

* release purpose;
* scope;
* type;
* target channel;
* version intent;
* dependencies;
* compatibility;
* validation needs;
* documentation;
* risk;
* governance;
* publication;
* recovery.

Planning prevents release execution from becoming an improvised sequence of commands.

---

## Release Types

FamilyOS recognizes several release purposes and domains.

Examples include:

```text id="x1sy05"
development
preview
feature
maintenance
security
emergency
framework
plugin
platform
documentation
```

Release types influence:

* validation profile;
* governance intensity;
* publication targets;
* recovery expectations;
* risk.

---

## Release Channels

Release channels describe consumer-facing stability or availability.

Canonical concepts include:

```text id="mt8j4p"
development
preview
candidate
stable
maintenance
```

Channels are mutable references.

Versions are immutable identities.

For example:

```text id="bcrv15"
stable → 5.2.0
```

may later become:

```text id="rpzumy"
stable → 5.3.0
```

without altering the identity of either release.

---

## Release Profiles

Release Profiles specialize the common Release Framework for different release contexts.

Potential profiles include:

```text id="zevqpm"
framework-release
documentation-release
plugin-release
platform-release
maintenance-release
security-release
emergency-release
```

Profiles may define different:

* gates;
* validation requirements;
* evidence;
* approvals;
* publication targets;
* recovery mechanisms.

Profiles must preserve core release invariants.

---

## Release Readiness

Release Readiness controls the transition:

```text id="8al7nc"
PREPARED
   ↓
READY
```

Readiness determines whether the release is sufficiently complete and controlled to enter formal candidate qualification.

Typical readiness domains include:

```text id="6k0pa8"
scope
repository
build
testing
quality
security
compliance
documentation
dependencies
compatibility
version
risk
governance
recovery
publication
```

Readiness must be evidence-based.

---

## Release Candidate

A Release Candidate is the exact release configuration submitted for final qualification.

A candidate may bind:

```text id="1rsp0m"
candidate identity
source revision
target version
build identity
artifact set
dependency state
configuration
documentation state
validation profile
```

Candidate identity creates the boundary between moving development state and release qualification.

---

## Candidate Stability

Once final validation begins, material candidate changes must trigger renewed qualification.

The preferred model is:

```text id="pf38kc"
5.2.0-rc.1
      ↓
material change
      ↓
5.2.0-rc.2
```

Candidate identifiers should not be reused for materially different release contents.

---

## Artifacts

Release artifacts are the exact outputs intentionally included in a release.

They may include:

* packages;
* binaries;
* source archives;
* plugin packages;
* documentation bundles;
* release manifests;
* provenance metadata.

Each significant artifact should have explicit identity.

---

## Artifact Integrity

Release artifacts should be verifiable where practical.

A simple integrity model is:

```text id="iw2m82"
artifact
   ↓
cryptographic digest
```

The preferred release relationship is:

```text id="x9s5vu"
candidate artifact digest
=
published artifact digest
```

This helps prove that the artifact validated is the artifact published.

---

## Artifact Immutability

Published artifacts under an official release identity should not be silently replaced.

The preferred correction model is:

```text id="p4zsht"
release X
problem found
      ↓
withdraw / supersede if necessary
      ↓
release X+1
```

rather than modifying release X in place.

---

## Provenance

Release provenance establishes where artifacts originated.

The canonical relationship is:

```text id="69ymqj"
Repository
   ↓
Source Revision
   ↓
Build
   ↓
Artifact
   ↓
Candidate
   ↓
Validation
   ↓
Official Release
```

FamilyOS provenance can mature progressively from simple commit identity to stronger signed attestations.

---

## Provenance Maturity

Potential maturity progression includes:

```text id="2uo9n7"
source commit
      ↓
build ID
      ↓
artifact checksums
      ↓
release manifest
      ↓
dependency inventory
      ↓
SBOM
      ↓
artifact signing
      ↓
signed provenance
      ↓
attestations
```

The framework supports this progression without requiring every advanced capability immediately.

---

## Release Validation

Release Validation qualifies the exact Release Candidate.

It controls:

```text id="36gf1h"
CANDIDATE
   ↓
VALIDATED
```

Validation may evaluate:

* candidate identity;
* source;
* repository;
* build;
* artifacts;
* provenance;
* version;
* tests;
* quality;
* security;
* compliance;
* documentation;
* compatibility;
* installation;
* migration;
* recovery.

Validation must remain bound to the actual candidate.

---

## Validation vs Approval

Validation and approval are deliberately separate.

Validation asks:

```text id="ffb3c9"
Does the candidate satisfy applicable requirements?
```

Approval asks:

```text id="y6so9w"
Is this validated candidate authorized to become an official release?
```

Therefore:

```text id="zjri1b"
VALIDATED
!=
APPROVED
```

This separation preserves governance.

---

## Release Governance

Release Governance defines authority and accountability.

Important governance roles may include:

```text id="b01pag"
Release Owner
Technical Owner
Validation Authority
Release Approver
Risk Authority
Exception Authority
Tagging Authority
Publication Authority
Distribution Authority
Security Authority
Framework Authority
```

One maintainer may initially hold several roles.

The conceptual responsibilities must remain distinct.

---

## Permission vs Authority

A fundamental governance rule is:

```text id="pn3dqy"
technical permission
!=
release authority
```

Possessing credentials or repository permissions does not automatically authorize an official release.

---

## Release Approval

Approval should bind to:

```text id="w9xudw"
candidate
release scope
version intent
risk state
exceptions
```

If the candidate changes materially, applicable approval must be reevaluated.

---

## Exceptions

Mandatory release requirements may only be bypassed where explicit policy allows a governed exception.

An exception should identify:

```text id="6r0dsr"
requirement
reason
risk
authority
compensating controls
scope
```

Exceptions must not silently redefine framework policy.

---

## Risk Management

Release risk influences the strength of release controls.

Risk may arise from:

* compatibility changes;
* security;
* dependencies;
* publication;
* migration;
* irreversible state;
* governance;
* recovery.

A technically valid candidate may still carry unacceptable release risk.

Risk acceptance therefore remains a governance decision.

---

## Security

Release Security applies across the complete supply chain.

The protected chain is:

```text id="ylu9kw"
Source
  ↓
Build
  ↓
Candidate
  ↓
Validation
  ↓
Approval
  ↓
Tag
  ↓
Publication
  ↓
Distribution
```

Release security includes:

* identity;
* authentication;
* authorization;
* least privilege;
* credential protection;
* source integrity;
* CI/CD security;
* artifact integrity;
* provenance security;
* dependency security;
* tag protection;
* registry security.

---

## Release Credentials

Release credentials must never become ordinary repository content.

They must not be embedded in:

* source;
* scripts;
* documentation;
* release notes;
* committed configuration.

Credentials should be:

* scoped;
* protected;
* rotatable;
* auditable where practical.

---

## CI/CD Integration

CI/CD is an execution mechanism for the Release Framework.

It must not become the only source of release semantics.

The intended relationship is:

```text id="5j3w0i"
Release Framework
      ↓
Release Policy
      ↓
Automation
      ↓
CI/CD
```

Validation and privileged publication should be separated where practical.

---

## CI/CD Trust

Lower-trust workflows such as untrusted pull request execution must not receive stable publication credentials.

Privileged release workflows should operate in trusted controlled environments.

---

## Release Automation

Automation exists to make release rules repeatable.

It may support:

* readiness checks;
* candidate creation;
* validation;
* version checks;
* artifact discovery;
* provenance;
* tagging;
* publishing;
* verification;
* recovery.

Automation must preserve documented release semantics.

---

## Automation Idempotency

Release automation should be idempotent where practical.

Example:

```text id="ip24d7"
tag exists and matches expected commit
→ verify and continue

tag exists and differs
→ block
```

Similarly:

```text id="u4qj7v"
artifact exists and checksum matches
→ verify

artifact exists and checksum differs
→ block
```

---

## Dry-Run Capability

Release tooling should detect as many problems as possible before external side effects.

A dry run may validate:

```text id="j3v7p7"
candidate
version
tag
artifacts
targets
permissions
policies
```

without publishing.

---

## Changelog

The changelog provides cumulative structured release history.

It should answer:

```text id="tb9fqo"
What changed?

In which version?

When was it released?
```

Typical categories include:

```text id="yaejae"
Added
Changed
Fixed
Deprecated
Removed
Security
```

---

## Release Notes

Release notes explain one specific release to its consumers.

They may include:

* summary;
* highlights;
* compatibility;
* breaking changes;
* migration;
* known issues;
* security;
* upgrade guidance.

Release notes must describe the actual Final Candidate.

---

## Changelog vs Release Notes

The distinction is:

```text id="pxizxr"
Changelog
historical release record

Release Notes
release-specific communication
```

They may share source information but serve different purposes.

---

## Publishing

Publishing transitions an approved release into authoritative external release state.

Publication targets may include:

```text id="prb848"
Git remote
package registry
plugin registry
artifact registry
documentation host
release page
```

All mandatory targets must be identified by the release profile.

---

## Publication Verification

Publication success must be verified through actual target state.

For example:

```text id="mjp15i"
push command succeeded
```

is weaker evidence than:

```text id="9p15a8"
remote tag exists
and points to expected commit
```

The same principle applies to packages, artifacts, and documentation.

---

## Partial Publication

Multi-target publication can fail partially.

Example:

```text id="m3rvbh"
Git Tag           PASS
Package Registry  PASS
Documentation     FAIL
Stable Channel    NOT STARTED
```

This must remain visible.

The release must not be reported simply as complete.

---

## Distribution

Distribution makes a published release available through consumer channels.

Examples include:

```text id="q5qy4g"
stable
candidate
preview
maintenance
```

Distribution should normally promote already validated and published artifacts rather than rebuilding them.

---

## Release Completion

A release should only reach `COMPLETED` after all applicable final obligations are satisfied.

This may include:

* official identity established;
* publication complete;
* distribution complete;
* release notes published;
* evidence recorded;
* final verification performed.

Completion must be explicit.

---

## Rollback

Rollback returns active consumer state to a previous release.

Rollback does not erase the defective release from history.

A rolled-back release remains identifiable.

---

## Rollback Safety

The existence of a previous version does not automatically make rollback safe.

Rollback feasibility may depend on:

* persistent data;
* schema migration;
* configuration;
* external side effects;
* compatibility.

Rollback strategy must therefore be planned and validated where necessary.

---

## Forward Recovery

When rollback is unsafe, FamilyOS may use forward recovery.

Example:

```text id="n09h3u"
5.2.0 defective
      ↓
5.2.1 corrective release
```

Forward recovery remains a first-class release strategy.

---

## Withdrawal

A release may be withdrawn when consumers should no longer use it.

Withdrawal preserves:

* release identity;
* historical evidence;
* reason;
* replacement guidance.

Withdrawal must not silently erase the release.

---

## Supersession

A release may become superseded when a later version becomes preferred.

Supersession is a normal historical transition.

It does not imply that the older release never existed.

---

## Observability

Release state must be visible and diagnosable.

Operators should be able to determine:

```text id="w7t44f"
current state
current candidate
validation result
approval state
publication status
distribution status
failure stage
recovery requirement
```

Raw CI/CD job state alone is insufficient for mature release observability.

---

## Release Events

Future FamilyOS release infrastructure may expose events such as:

```text id="4mrnfh"
release.planned
release.ready
release.candidate.created
release.validated
release.approved
release.released
release.published
release.distributed
release.completed
release.failed
release.withdrawn
```

These events should align with lifecycle semantics.

---

## Evidence

Release Evidence aggregates the information required to justify and reconstruct release decisions.

Conceptually:

```text id="3tbbmu"
Release Evidence
├── Source Evidence
├── Build Evidence
├── Test Evidence
├── Quality Evidence
├── Security Evidence
├── Compliance Evidence
├── Artifact Evidence
├── Provenance Evidence
├── Approval Evidence
├── Publication Evidence
└── Recovery Evidence
```

Evidence should outlive transient terminal sessions where historical reconstruction requires it.

---

## Compliance

Release Compliance evaluates whether release execution followed applicable Release Framework requirements.

Compliance may evaluate:

* profile requirements;
* candidate identity;
* mandatory gates;
* evidence;
* approval;
* security;
* publication;
* recovery.

Compliance evaluates framework conformance.

It does not redefine the Release Framework.

---

## Metrics

Release Metrics should help FamilyOS improve release reliability and maturity.

Potential metrics include:

* release success rate;
* candidate rejection rate;
* release lead time;
* publication failure rate;
* rollback rate;
* recovery time;
* automation coverage;
* evidence completeness;
* exception frequency.

Metrics must not incentivize bypassing quality or governance.

---

## Framework Lifecycle

The Release Framework itself is a versioned engineering capability.

Its lifecycle may include:

```text id="r7tbr0"
PROPOSED
DRAFT
VALIDATED
APPROVED
RELEASED
ACTIVE
MAINTAINED
DEPRECATED
RETIRED
```

EPIC-REL-001 must progressively apply its own release principles to future versions of itself.

---

## Framework Evolution

Release Framework changes should distinguish:

```text id="l8nmzz"
EDITORIAL
CLARIFICATION
COMPATIBLE
NORMATIVE
BREAKING
SECURITY
```

Normative and breaking changes require stronger validation, versioning, governance, and migration consideration.

---

## Framework Self-Application

The initial EPIC-REL-001 release is a bootstrap release.

Conceptually:

```text id="qqz5dm"
existing FamilyOS release discipline
      ↓
creates
EPIC-REL-001
      ↓
EPIC-REL-001
governs future FamilyOS releases
```

Future Release Framework revisions should increasingly use the framework they inherit.

---

## Integration With Other FamilyOS Frameworks

EPIC-REL-001 integrates outputs from several existing engineering foundations.

Conceptually:

```text id="iz642q"
Engineering Foundation
Build Framework
Testing Framework
Quality Framework
Documentation Framework
Plugin Compliance Framework
Security Architecture
        ↓
Release Framework
        ↓
Official Release
```

The Release Framework coordinates their evidence.

It does not replace their responsibilities.

---

## Build Framework Relationship

EPIC-BLD-001 defines artifact production.

EPIC-REL-001 defines artifact qualification and official publication.

---

## Testing Framework Relationship

EPIC-TST-001 defines testing methodology.

EPIC-REL-001 determines which test evidence is required for release qualification.

---

## Quality Framework Relationship

EPIC-QLT-001 defines quality architecture and gates.

EPIC-REL-001 consumes applicable quality evidence.

---

## Documentation Framework Relationship

EPIC-DOC-001 defines documentation architecture and standards.

EPIC-REL-001 governs when changelogs, release notes, validation records, and release documentation are required.

---

## Plugin Compliance Relationship

EPIC-PLUGIN-002 provides plugin compliance evidence that may become mandatory for official plugin releases.

---

## Security Architecture Relationship

FamilyOS Security Architecture provides the broader security context for release credentials, trust boundaries, supply-chain integrity, and privileged authority.

---

## Current FamilyOS Framework Release Model

Current FamilyOS framework releases already implement a simplified version of the target architecture.

The practical model is:

```text id="01wpqw"
complete framework
      ↓
validate documents
      ↓
verify repository
      ↓
commit final state
      ↓
assign version
      ↓
create annotated tag
      ↓
push branch
      ↓
push tag
      ↓
verify remote state
      ↓
working tree clean
```

EPIC-REL-001 formalizes and expands this process.

---

## EPIC-REL-001 Canonical Structure

The canonical numbered documents are:

```text id="4aqn4f"
00-EPIC.md
01-Context.md
02-Vision.md

27-References.md
28-Validation.md
29-Summary.md
30-Release.md
31-Implementation-Checklist.md
```

Control documents complete the framework package.

---

## Framework Control Documents

The framework also depends on control documents such as:

```text id="livg2e"
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

These provide:

* metadata;
* lifecycle state;
* completeness;
* validation evidence;
* change history;
* governance context.

---

## Core Release Invariants

The complete Release Framework can be condensed into several core invariants.

### RI1 — A build is not automatically a release.

### RI2 — Every official release has an explicit identity.

### RI3 — Every release maps to identifiable source state.

### RI4 — Release readiness is evidence-based.

### RI5 — Final validation applies to an exact candidate.

### RI6 — Material candidate changes invalidate affected evidence.

### RI7 — Official versions and published artifacts are immutable identities.

### RI8 — Version semantics remain consistent.

### RI9 — Official Git release tags identify exact source revisions.

### RI10 — Release authority is explicit.

### RI11 — Technical permission does not automatically equal governance authority.

### RI12 — Publication must be verified.

### RI13 — Partial release failure must remain visible.

### RI14 — Recovery is part of release design.

### RI15 — Release security applies across the complete supply chain.

### RI16 — Release evidence must support historical reconstruction.

### RI17 — Automation implements the framework rather than redefining it.

### RI18 — Release channels remain distinct from immutable version identities.

### RI19 — Historical releases must not be silently rewritten.

### RI20 — The Release Framework must govern its own future evolution.

---

## Minimal Release Model

The minimum disciplined FamilyOS release process can be represented as:

```text id="pzpn8e"
PREPARE
   ↓
VERIFY
   ↓
VALIDATE
   ↓
APPROVE
   ↓
IDENTIFY
   ↓
PUBLISH
   ↓
VERIFY
   ↓
COMPLETE
```

This model can be implemented manually.

The long-term objective is increasingly reliable automation.

---

## Target Release Architecture

The target architecture is:

```text id="of195t"
Release Plan
    ↓
Release Profile
    ↓
Readiness Evaluation
    ↓
Release Candidate
    ↓
Artifact + Provenance Binding
    ↓
Candidate Validation
    ↓
Risk Evaluation
    ↓
Governance Approval
    ↓
Version Finalization
    ↓
Repository Anchor
    ↓
Publication
    ↓
Distribution
    ↓
Verification
    ↓
Evidence
    ↓
Observation
    ↓
Recovery Capability
```

This provides an end-to-end release engineering model.

---

## Maturity Path

FamilyOS release engineering can evolve progressively.

```text id="8nvww9"
Stage 1
Documented manual release

Stage 2
Standardized validation

Stage 3
Automated readiness

Stage 4
Formal candidate identity

Stage 5
Artifact provenance

Stage 6
Controlled CI/CD release pipelines

Stage 7
Governed publication automation

Stage 8
Structured release evidence

Stage 9
Signing, SBOM, and attestations

Stage 10
Policy-driven release orchestration
```

The framework is designed to support this progression without fundamental redesign.

---

## Future Release Orchestrator

At higher maturity, FamilyOS may provide a Release Orchestrator capable of coordinating:

```text id="cb2z8m"
plan
check
candidate
validate
approve
publish
verify
recover
```

A future CLI could expose interfaces such as:

```text id="svxckh"
familyos release plan
familyos release check
familyos release candidate
familyos release validate
familyos release publish
familyos release verify
familyos release recover
```

These are implementation targets rather than current requirements.

---

## Machine-Evaluable Policy

Many objective release rules should eventually become machine-evaluable.

For example:

```text id="3n8fd1"
working_tree_clean == true
candidate_validated == true
blocking_findings == 0
version_valid == true
tag_unique == true
approval_granted == true
```

Policy-as-code should reflect the human-readable framework rather than replace it.

---

## Human Judgment

Not all release decisions should be automated.

Human judgment remains appropriate for:

* risk acceptance;
* architectural significance;
* known issue acceptance;
* migration quality;
* security exceptions;
* emergency authorization.

The framework therefore combines deterministic automation with governed judgment.

---

## Release Trust Model

The desired end-to-end trust chain is:

```text id="wpo5lk"
Trusted Source
    ↓
Controlled Build
    ↓
Identified Candidate
    ↓
Verified Artifact
    ↓
Validated Release
    ↓
Governed Approval
    ↓
Protected Publication
    ↓
Verified Distribution
    ↓
Trusted Consumer Release
```

This is the long-term security and provenance objective of EPIC-REL-001.

---

## Historical Reconstruction

For every significant official release, FamilyOS should progressively be able to determine:

```text id="qnkhy4"
what was released
which version identified it
which source produced it
which candidate was validated
which artifacts belonged to it
what evidence passed
who approved it
where it was published
whether it was later withdrawn or superseded
```

This is one of the clearest measures of release maturity.

---

## Release Failure Philosophy

Release failure is not exceptional noise.

It is a first-class engineering state.

The framework therefore requires failures to remain:

* explicit;
* diagnosable;
* attributable;
* recoverable.

A failed release must not be mistaken for a successful one simply because some operations completed.

---

## Release Recovery Philosophy

Recovery is designed before failure.

Recovery may use:

```text id="ifslwx"
retry
rollback
withdrawal
channel restoration
corrective release
forward recovery
```

The appropriate mechanism depends on actual release state.

---

## Release Security Philosophy

Release security is not a final-stage scan.

It is the protection of:

```text id="t68an6"
source
identity
credentials
candidate
artifacts
provenance
approval
tag
publication
distribution
```

across the complete lifecycle.

---

## Release Governance Philosophy

Release Governance ensures that every significant transition represents an authorized engineering decision.

The framework therefore avoids:

```text id="co7n91"
whoever can publish
=
whoever may publish
```

Release authority must remain explicit.

---

## Release Automation Philosophy

Automation should make the correct release process easier to execute.

It must not make an incorrect or undocumented process faster.

This means automation should be:

* modular;
* stateful;
* idempotent;
* observable;
* testable;
* policy-driven;
* secure.

---

## Release Documentation Philosophy

Release documentation is part of the release.

Consumers must not be expected to infer:

* what changed;
* whether compatibility changed;
* whether migration is needed;
* which known issues remain.

Changelog and release notes therefore participate in readiness and validation.

---

## Release Quality Philosophy

Release quality is not defined by one test result.

Release confidence emerges from combined evidence across:

```text id="hvtlup"
build
testing
quality
security
compliance
documentation
artifacts
provenance
governance
risk
```

The Release Framework integrates these signals.

---

## Framework Completion Direction

Before EPIC-REL-001 itself can be considered complete, the framework package must demonstrate:

```text id="he6pmo"
canonical structure
complete numbered documents
control document alignment
validation
summary
release record
implementation checklist
version consistency
repository consistency
```

These requirements are finalized in the remaining closure documents.

---

## Remaining Closure Documents

After this Summary, the remaining canonical documents are:

```text id="vyjf2l"
30-Release.md
31-Implementation-Checklist.md
```

together with final control document alignment and repository validation.

`28-Validation.md` provides the validation model used before closure.

---

## Expected EPIC Outcome

When EPIC-REL-001 is complete, FamilyOS will have a formal release architecture capable of governing:

* engineering framework releases;
* official plugin releases;
* documentation releases;
* maintenance releases;
* security releases;
* future platform releases;
* future packaged artifacts;
* future multi-component releases.

This provides a reusable foundation rather than a one-off release procedure.

---

## Strategic Effect

The strategic transition created by EPIC-REL-001 is:

```text id="h4qmxh"
Manual Commands
      ↓
Documented Release Process
      ↓
Formal Release Lifecycle
      ↓
Evidence-Based Gates
      ↓
Release Candidates
      ↓
Governed Publication
      ↓
Structured Provenance
      ↓
Release Automation
      ↓
Policy-Driven Release Platform
```

This transition improves reliability while preserving architectural control.

---

## Final Framework Summary

EPIC-REL-001 establishes that an official FamilyOS release must be:

```text id="ex3tg9"
IDENTIFIED
TRACEABLE
PLANNED
READY
CANDIDATE-BOUND
VALIDATED
APPROVED
VERSIONED
INTEGRITY-PROTECTED
PUBLISHED
VERIFIED
OBSERVABLE
GOVERNED
RECOVERABLE
```

These properties define release maturity more accurately than automation alone.

---

## Final Statement

The FamilyOS Release Framework establishes release engineering as a permanent platform capability.

It provides the architecture connecting engineering completion to official software and documentation history.

Through explicit lifecycle states, versioning, candidate identity, artifact provenance, validation, governance, security, automation, publication, observability, risk management, and recovery, FamilyOS gains a release model capable of evolving from disciplined manual execution into a fully governed release platform.

The framework ensures that an official FamilyOS release is never merely something that was built, tagged, or uploaded.

It is a controlled engineering state whose identity, evidence, authority, provenance, publication, and history can be understood and trusted.
