# Release Framework

## 31 Implementation Checklist

### Overview

EPIC-REL-001 — Release Framework establishes a complete release engineering model for FamilyOS.

The framework is complete only when its normative architecture, control documents, validation evidence, release record, and required implementation obligations are aligned.

The Implementation Checklist provides the final completion model for the EPIC.

Its purpose is to distinguish between:

* framework definition;
* documentation completeness;
* architectural consistency;
* governance readiness;
* implementation readiness;
* automation maturity;
* release readiness;
* final publication state.

This checklist must not be interpreted as requiring every long-term Release Framework capability to be fully automated before EPIC-REL-001 can be released.

The framework intentionally defines both:

```text
current required capability
```

and:

```text
future target capability
```

The distinction must remain explicit.

---

## Purpose

The Implementation Checklist is used to determine whether EPIC-REL-001 is ready for closure and publication.

It verifies that:

* canonical documents exist;
* document structure is correct;
* release concepts are complete;
* control documents are aligned;
* framework cross-references are coherent;
* release validation is complete;
* release governance is satisfied;
* current implementation obligations are met;
* deferred automation is explicitly identified;
* repository state is ready for release;
* final release evidence can be produced.

---

## Completion Principle

The central completion principle is:

> EPIC-REL-001 is complete when the Release Framework is architecturally complete, internally consistent, validated, governed, releasable, and sufficiently implementable for its declared maturity level.

Completion does not require the immediate implementation of every advanced future capability described by the framework.

For example:

```text
artifact signing
SBOM generation
signed provenance
release orchestrator
policy engine
```

may remain future capabilities unless explicitly declared mandatory for the current release milestone.

---

## Completion Categories

The implementation checklist is organized into the following categories:

```text
Framework Structure
Core Release Architecture
Lifecycle and Versioning
Planning and Readiness
Candidates and Provenance
Validation

Release Communication
Repository and Tagging
Publishing and Distribution
Recovery
Security
Observability
Governance
Compliance
Metrics

Validation
→ Approval

Approval
→ Release Identity

Release Identity
→ Publication

Publication
→ Distribution

Failure

[ ] no obsolete numbered files
```

---

## Git Release State

Before official tagging:

```text
[ ] all release-relevant changes committed
[ ] release commit identified
[ ] branch state verified
[ ] intended tag available
[ ] tag target planned
```

---

## Remote Publication State

After release publication:

```text
[ ] release branch pushed
[ ] remote branch points to expected commit

[ ] tag pushed
[ ] remote tag exists
[ ] remote tag points to release commit
[ ] local and remote release identity agree
```

---

After publication:

```text
[ ] working tree clean
```

A clean final working tree provides evidence that the published release state has not left uncontrolled local changes.

---

## Current Implementation Baseline

EPIC-REL-001 may be considered implementable at its initial maturity level when FamilyOS can execute a disciplined manual framework release that includes:

```text
release planning
framework validation
repository validation
version decision
final commit
annotated tag
remote publication
remote verification
release evidence
```

Checklist:

```text
[ ] current manual release path documented
[ ] current manual release path executable
[ ] current manual release path consistent with framework
```

---

## Deferred Implementation

The following capabilities may remain roadmap work unless separately made mandatory:

```text
[ ] full Release Orchestrator
[ ] machine-readable release manifest
[ ] automated version recommendation
[ ] candidate reservation service
[ ] automated multi-target publication
[ ] structured release evidence store
[ ] policy-as-code engine
[ ] mandatory artifact signing
[ ] mandatory tag signing
[ ] SBOM generation
[ ] signed provenance
[ ] SLSA-compatible attestations
[ ] automated stable-channel management
[ ] automated rollback orchestration
[ ] release telemetry platform
[ ] multi-repository orchestration
```

Unchecked items in this section do not prevent EPIC documentation closure.

They represent future maturity objectives.

---

## Deferred Capability Rule

A deferred capability is acceptable only when:

```text
[ ] framework describes its intended semantics
[ ] current alternative is understood
[ ] deferred status is visible
[ ] roadmap captures future implementation where appropriate
```

---

## No False Completion

EPIC closure MUST NOT claim that a future capability is implemented merely because its architecture has been documented.

For example:

```text
documented:
artifact signing
```

must not be recorded as:

```text
implemented:
artifact signing
```

unless the actual implementation exists and is validated.

---

## Final Release Evidence

The final evidence should be sufficient to produce a release statement such as:

```text
EPIC-REL-001 — Release Framework

Framework Structure    PASS
Validation             PASS
Control Documents      PASS
Repository State       PASS
Version                VERIFIED
Release Commit         VERIFIED
Official Tag           VERIFIED
Remote Publication     VERIFIED
Working Tree           CLEAN

STATUS                 RELEASED
```

Actual values must be filled from the repository at release time.

---

## Suggested Final Validation Commands

The exact validation script may evolve, but final closure should verify the framework directory explicitly.

Conceptually:

```text
EPIC_DIR="docs/epics/EPIC-REL-001-release-framework"
```

Structure checks should include:

```text
tree "$EPIC_DIR"
```

```text
find "$EPIC_DIR" -maxdepth 1 -type f -empty -print | sort
```

```text
find "$EPIC_DIR" -maxdepth 1 -type f \
  -name '[0-9][0-9]-*.md' \
  -exec basename {} \; | sort
```

Duplicate check:

```text
find "$EPIC_DIR" -maxdepth 1 -type f \
  -name '[0-9][0-9]-*.md' \
  -exec basename {} \; \
  | cut -c1-2 \
  | sort \
  | uniq -d
```

Repository check:

```text
git status --short
```

The final release validation may add stronger checks defined in `28-Validation.md`.

---

## Suggested Release Identity Checks

Before publication:

```text
git rev-parse HEAD
```

```text
git status --short
```

```text
git tag --list
```

After remote publication, equivalent checks should confirm:

```text
HEAD
=
remote release branch
=
official tag target
```

according to the applicable release sequence.

---

## Checklist Status Model

Checklist items may use:

```text
[ ]
not complete

[x]
complete
```

Optional future capability may use explicit annotation such as:

```text
[ ] DEFERRED — future roadmap capability
```

This prevents deferred implementation from appearing accidentally incomplete.

---

## Blocking Checklist Items

The following categories are blocking for EPIC closure:

```text
canonical document completeness
canonical numbering integrity
control document alignment
framework validation
repository consistency
version consistency
release record
official release publication
```

---

## Non-Blocking Future Items

The following are non-blocking unless current policy explicitly promotes them to mandatory status:

```text
full orchestration
artifact signing
SBOM
signed provenance
advanced metrics automation
automatic risk scoring
multi-repository release coordination
```

---

## Completion Decision

The final completion decision should answer three distinct questions.

### Question 1

Is the Release Framework definition complete?

```text
YES / NO
```

---

### Question 2

Is the current required implementation sufficient to operate the framework at its declared maturity level?

```text
YES / NO
```

---

### Question 3

Is the framework release itself validated and published correctly?

```text
YES / NO
```

Only when all three answers are `YES` should EPIC-REL-001 be considered officially closed.

---

## Closure Gate

The final EPIC closure gate is:

```text
Framework Definition      PASS
Framework Structure       PASS
Control Documents         PASS
Validation                PASS
Current Implementation    PASS
Governance                PASS
Repository State          PASS
Version                   PASS
Official Tag              PASS
Remote Publication        PASS
Final Verification        PASS
--------------------------------
EPIC-REL-001               COMPLETE
```

---

## Post-Release Work

After EPIC closure, future work may continue through:

* roadmap implementation;
* release automation;
* CI/CD hardening;
* provenance implementation;
* security hardening;
* policy-as-code;
* metrics;
* release tooling;
* additional release profiles.

These activities evolve the Release Framework.

They do not invalidate the completed foundational EPIC.

---

## Relationship With 28-Validation.md

`28-Validation.md` defines how framework closure is validated.

This checklist defines what must ultimately be complete.

The relationship is:

```text
Implementation Checklist
"What must be complete?"

        ↓

Validation
"Can we prove it is complete?"
```

---

## Relationship With 29-Summary.md

`29-Summary.md` provides the consolidated architectural view.

This document converts that architecture into explicit completion obligations.

---

## Relationship With 30-Release.md

`30-Release.md` records the actual official release state.

This checklist determines when that release record may legitimately declare EPIC-REL-001 complete.

---

## Relationship With Framework Lifecycle

`25-Framework-Lifecycle.md` defines how future EPIC-REL-001 versions evolve after this initial release.

This checklist closes the current framework milestone.

---

## Implementation Checklist Invariants

The following invariants apply.

### IC1 — Documentation completeness must not be confused with implementation completeness.

### IC2 — Future roadmap capability must not be falsely marked as implemented.

### IC3 — Current mandatory release requirements must be satisfied before closure.

### IC4 — Canonical structure must be unambiguous.

### IC5 — Control documents must align with normative documents.

### IC6 — Release validation must be evidence-based.

### IC7 — Final version and tag must reflect actual repository state.

### IC8 — Remote publication must be verified.

### IC9 — Framework closure requires explicit governance.

### IC10 — Deferred capabilities must remain visible.

### IC11 — Historical release identity must be preserved.

### IC12 — EPIC closure must be reproducible from repository evidence.

---

## Implementation Anti-Patterns

### Architecture Equals Implementation

Marking a capability complete merely because it is documented.

---

### Everything Must Be Automated

Refusing to release the foundational framework until every future automation capability exists.

---

### Future Capability Hidden

Leaving major implementation gaps undocumented.

---

### Checklist Theater

Marking items complete without actual evidence.

---

### Control Document Drift

Closing the EPIC while metadata still reflects the old framework structure.

---

### Tag Before Closure

Creating the official release tag before final control documents and release record are committed.

---

### Remote Assumption

Assuming publication succeeded without verifying authoritative remote state.

---

### Dirty Final State

Declaring the EPIC closed while local release-relevant changes remain uncommitted.

---

## Minimum Closure State

The minimum acceptable EPIC-REL-001 closure state is:

```text
Canonical Framework       COMPLETE
Control Documents         ALIGNED
Validation                PASS
Manual Release Process    OPERATIONAL
Version                   FINAL
Release Commit            FINAL
Annotated Tag             PUBLISHED
Remote State              VERIFIED
Working Tree              CLEAN
```

---

## Target Long-Term Implementation State

The long-term FamilyOS implementation target is substantially more advanced:

```text
Release Request
      ↓
Automated Planning Assistance
      ↓
Readiness Engine
      ↓
Candidate Creation
      ↓
Build + Provenance
      ↓
Automated Validation
      ↓
Governance Approval
      ↓
Policy Engine
      ↓
Protected Publication
      ↓
Distribution Promotion
      ↓
Observability
      ↓
Recovery Orchestration
      ↓
Release Evidence Store
```

This is the target platform capability toward which EPIC-REL-001 provides the architecture.

---

## Final Completion Statement

EPIC-REL-001 — Release Framework is ready for closure only when its canonical architecture, lifecycle, versioning strategy, readiness model, candidate model, artifact provenance, validation, automation model, CI/CD integration, release communication, repository state rules, publication model, recovery model, security, observability, governance, compliance, metrics, risk management, framework lifecycle, roadmap, references, validation, summary, release record, and control documents form one coherent and validated framework.

The Implementation Checklist ensures that FamilyOS does not confuse architectural ambition with current implementation, nor current manual operation with long-term release maturity.

The initial Release Framework may therefore close with disciplined manual release execution while preserving a clear path toward automated, policy-driven, provenance-aware release engineering.

Once all blocking checklist items are satisfied, the final release evidence is verified, the official release tag is published, and repository state is clean, **EPIC-REL-001 may be declared complete.**
