# Release Framework

## 27 References

### Overview

EPIC-REL-001 — Release Framework depends on a broader set of FamilyOS engineering foundations, architecture decisions, specifications, governance documents, and external industry standards.

The purpose of this reference document is to provide a stable index of the primary sources that influence or constrain the Release Framework.

These references support:

* architectural consistency;
* normative traceability;
* terminology alignment;
* framework integration;
* release policy design;
* implementation planning;
* future automation;
* security evolution;
* compliance evaluation.

This document does not redefine the referenced sources.

Where conflicts exist, the applicable FamilyOS normative hierarchy and governance process determine precedence.

---

## Reference Principles

The Release Framework follows several reference principles.

### R1 — Internal FamilyOS sources take precedence for FamilyOS-specific behavior.

### R2 — Architecture decisions constrain framework implementation where applicable.

### R3 — Specifications define formal contracts where such contracts exist.

### R4 — External standards inform implementation but do not automatically become FamilyOS requirements.

### R5 — Referenced standards must not silently override FamilyOS governance.

### R6 — Reference changes may require Release Framework review.

---

## Normative Reference Hierarchy

A conceptual reference hierarchy is:

```text
FamilyOS Engineering Constitution
        ↓
Architecture Decisions
        ↓
Specifications
        ↓
Engineering Frameworks
        ↓
Release Policies
        ↓
Release Profiles
        ↓
Implementation Guidance
        ↓
External Standards and Practices
```

The exact precedence is governed by FamilyOS documentation and architecture governance.

---

## FamilyOS Foundation References

The Release Framework is part of the broader FamilyOS engineering platform and should remain aligned with the foundation documentation under:

```text
docs/00-foundation/
```

Important foundation areas include:

* architecture;
* engineering governance;
* security;
* deployment;
* observability;
* configuration;
* plugins;
* infrastructure;
* integration;
* documentation;
* lifecycle management.

---

## Engineering Constitution

The FamilyOS Engineering Constitution provides the highest-level engineering principles that guide platform design and development.

Reference:

```text
docs/00-foundation/Engineering-Constitution.md
```

EPIC-REL-001 must remain compatible with the engineering principles defined there.

---

## Architecture Vision

The Architecture Vision defines the long-term structural direction of FamilyOS.

Reference:

```text
docs/00-foundation/Architecture-Vision.md
```

Release architecture must support the platform's long-term modular and extensible evolution.

---

## Architecture Map

The Architecture Map provides a high-level representation of FamilyOS architecture domains.

Reference:

```text
docs/00-foundation/Architecture-Map.md
```

The Release Framework should integrate with existing architectural domains rather than introduce isolated release concepts.

---

## Framework Lifecycle Foundation

The general FamilyOS framework lifecycle provides broader context for engineering framework evolution.

Reference:

```text
docs/00-foundation/Framework-Lifecycle.md
```

`25-Framework-Lifecycle.md` specializes lifecycle expectations for the Release Framework.

---

## Release Strategy Foundation

The FamilyOS foundation release strategy provides historical and architectural context for versioning and release progression.

Reference:

```text
docs/00-foundation/Release-Strategy.md
```

EPIC-REL-001 formalizes and expands these release concepts into a complete engineering framework.

---

## Deployment Architecture

Deployment and release are related but distinct concepts.

Reference:

```text
docs/00-foundation/Deployment-Architecture.md
```

EPIC-REL-001 must preserve the distinction:

```text
release
!=
deployment
```

unless a specific implementation intentionally combines them.

---

## Security Architecture

Release security must remain aligned with the FamilyOS security foundation.

Reference:

```text
docs/00-foundation/Security-Architecture.md
```

Relevant areas include:

* identity;
* authorization;
* credential protection;
* supply-chain integrity;
* trust boundaries;
* secure automation.

---

## Observability Architecture

Release observability should integrate with the platform's broader observability architecture.

Reference:

```text
docs/00-foundation/Observability-Architecture.md
```

Release state, events, failures, and evidence should eventually participate in the common observability model.

---

## Configuration Architecture

Release configuration should remain consistent with FamilyOS configuration principles.

Reference:

```text
docs/00-foundation/Configuration-Architecture.md
```

Release automation must avoid hidden or uncontrolled configuration.

---

## Infrastructure Architecture

Release infrastructure may rely on CI/CD systems, registries, signing services, or storage infrastructure.

Reference:

```text
docs/00-foundation/Infrastructure-Architecture.md
```

Release infrastructure should remain replaceable and avoid unnecessary provider lock-in.

---

## Integration Architecture

Release workflows may integrate with repositories, registries, CI/CD systems, documentation platforms, and future distribution systems.

Reference:

```text
docs/00-foundation/Integration-Architecture.md
```

These integrations should preserve stable release semantics.

---

## Plugin Architecture

Official plugin release behavior must remain compatible with the FamilyOS Plugin Architecture.

Reference:

```text
docs/00-foundation/Plugin-Architecture.md
```

Relevant release concerns include:

* plugin identity;
* compatibility;
* metadata;
* versioning;
* official plugin status;
* lifecycle.

---

## Documentation Architecture

Release documentation must remain aligned with the FamilyOS documentation architecture.

Reference:

```text
docs/00-foundation/Documentation-Architecture.md
```

Changelogs, release notes, validation reports, and framework documents are documentation assets as well as release artifacts.

---

## Engineering Foundation

EPIC-ENG-001 — Engineering Foundation establishes engineering practices upon which Release Framework behavior depends.

Reference directory:

```text
docs/epics/EPIC-ENG-001-engineering-foundation/
```

Important topics include:

* repository architecture;
* engineering workflow;
* coding standards;
* toolchain;
* environment management;
* dependency management;
* configuration management;
* testing philosophy;
* quality philosophy;
* technical governance;
* engineering lifecycle.

---

## Testing Framework

EPIC-TST-001 — Testing Framework defines FamilyOS testing architecture and methodology.

Reference directory:

```text
docs/epics/EPIC-TST-001-testing-framework/
```

The Release Framework consumes testing evidence generated according to this framework.

The Release Framework does not redefine testing methodology.

---

## Quality Framework

EPIC-QLT-001 — Quality Framework defines FamilyOS quality architecture and governance.

Reference directory:

```text
docs/epics/EPIC-QLT-001-quality-framework/
```

Release Readiness and Release Validation may consume:

* quality gates;
* quality evidence;
* defect state;
* quality metrics;
* quality risk.

---

## Documentation Framework

EPIC-DOC-001 — Documentation Framework defines documentation architecture, standards, lifecycle, metadata, versioning, validation, automation, and governance.

Reference directory:

```text
docs/epics/EPIC-DOC-001-documentation-framework/
```

EPIC-REL-001 relies on this framework for:

* changelog quality;
* release notes;
* document structure;
* metadata;
* Markdown standards;
* documentation validation;
* documentation governance.

---

## Build Framework

EPIC-BLD-001 — Build Framework defines how FamilyOS transforms controlled source into reproducible and identifiable build outputs.

Reference directory:

```text
docs/epics/EPIC-BLD-001-build-framework/
```

The Release Framework consumes Build Framework outputs and evidence.

The relationship is:

```text
Source
  ↓
Build Framework
  ↓
Build Artifacts
  ↓
Release Framework
  ↓
Release Candidate
```

---

## Plugin Compliance Framework

EPIC-PLUGIN-002 — Plugin Compliance Framework defines the compliance architecture for FamilyOS plugins.

Reference directory:

```text
docs/epics/EPIC-PLUGIN-002-plugin-compliance-framework/
```

Official plugin release profiles may consume compliance evidence from this framework.

---

## Architecture Decision Records

FamilyOS Architecture Decision Records provide authoritative architectural decisions that may constrain Release Framework behavior.

ADR directory location may vary according to repository architecture.

Release Framework maintainers must review applicable ADRs before significant framework changes.

---

## ADR-0007 — Official Plugins Architecture

ADR-0007 defines the architecture of official FamilyOS plugins.

It is relevant to:

* plugin release identity;
* plugin versioning;
* plugin compatibility;
* official publication;
* plugin lifecycle.

Official plugin release profiles must remain consistent with this ADR.

---

## Other Applicable ADRs

EPIC-REL-001 may also depend on later ADRs governing areas such as:

* plugin strategy;
* governance;
* compliance;
* release architecture;
* distribution;
* security;
* artifact provenance.

The authoritative ADR index should be used to determine current applicability.

---

## Request for Comments

FamilyOS RFCs provide detailed design proposals for major platform capabilities.

Official plugin RFCs include:

```text
RFC-0010 — Security
RFC-0011 — Health
RFC-0012 — Finance
RFC-0013 — Education
RFC-0014 — Documents
RFC-0015 — Communication
```

Release profiles for these domains may need to respect their documented compatibility and lifecycle requirements.

---

## Specification References

FamilyOS specifications define formal contracts that may influence release qualification.

Specification directory:

```text
docs/06-specifications/
```

Specifications should be consulted where release validity depends on formal contract conformance.

---

## SPEC-0001 — Structure

Where applicable, structural specifications may define requirements that release validation must enforce.

---

## Identifier Specifications

Identifier specifications may constrain:

* release metadata;
* artifact identifiers;
* component identifiers;
* versioned entity identity.

---

## Metadata Specifications

Metadata specifications may influence future machine-readable:

* release manifests;
* candidate manifests;
* artifact metadata;
* provenance records;
* compatibility information.

---

## Versioning Specifications

Where formal FamilyOS versioning specifications exist, they should take precedence over informal implementation conventions.

`06-Versioning-Strategy.md` must remain aligned with such specifications.

---

## Document Format Specifications

Release documents and machine-readable release metadata must comply with applicable FamilyOS document format specifications.

---

## Repository References

The FamilyOS Git repository is the authoritative source repository for current Release Framework development.

The release process relies on Git concepts including:

* commits;
* branches;
* annotated tags;
* remote references;
* repository history.

---

## Git Documentation

Git is the primary source control mechanism currently used by FamilyOS.

Relevant Git concepts include:

* commit objects;
* refs;
* tags;
* annotated tags;
* remote tracking branches;
* push;
* fetch;
* merge;
* history.

Implementation should rely on official Git behavior rather than undocumented assumptions.

---

## Semantic Versioning

FamilyOS uses semantic version concepts as the default versioning model defined in `06-Versioning-Strategy.md`.

External reference:

```text
Semantic Versioning 2.0.0
```

Relevant concepts include:

```text
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
```

with optional:

```text
-pre-release
+build-metadata
```

FamilyOS may apply additional repository-specific tag conventions.

---

## Keep a Changelog

The FamilyOS changelog approach is conceptually compatible with widely adopted structured changelog practices such as Keep a Changelog.

Relevant categories include:

```text
Added
Changed
Deprecated
Removed
Fixed
Security
```

External conventions are informative unless explicitly adopted as normative FamilyOS requirements.

---

## Conventional Commits

Conventional Commits MAY inform future automated change classification.

Possible categories include:

```text
feat
fix
docs
refactor
chore
```

FamilyOS does not require Conventional Commits merely by referencing the concept.

Formal adoption should be governed separately.

---

## CI/CD References

FamilyOS Release Automation should remain provider-independent.

Potential CI/CD implementations may include:

* GitHub Actions;
* GitLab CI;
* Jenkins;
* Buildkite;
* other controlled CI/CD systems.

Provider documentation is implementation reference material, not normative release architecture.

---

## GitHub Actions

Where GitHub Actions is used, relevant capabilities may include:

* workflows;
* jobs;
* protected environments;
* artifacts;
* secrets;
* approvals;
* permissions;
* reusable workflows;
* concurrency control.

FamilyOS release semantics must remain independent from GitHub Actions.

---

## Package Registry References

Future FamilyOS releases may publish artifacts to package or artifact registries.

Examples may include:

* Python package registries;
* container registries;
* plugin registries;
* Git hosting release storage;
* generic artifact registries.

Each target must be governed through release publication profiles.

---

## Python Packaging References

For Python-based FamilyOS components, relevant external packaging references may include:

* Python Packaging User Guide;
* wheel format;
* source distributions;
* project metadata;
* package version metadata.

Packaging rules must remain aligned with the Build Framework and applicable FamilyOS specifications.

---

## PEP 440

Python package versions may need compatibility with PEP 440 where Python packaging infrastructure requires it.

FamilyOS semantic release versioning should therefore avoid version formats incompatible with the target package ecosystem.

PEP 440 is an implementation compatibility reference, not necessarily the authoritative platform versioning model.

---

## Software Supply-Chain References

Release provenance and artifact security should remain compatible with mature software supply-chain approaches.

Relevant external initiatives include:

* SLSA;
* in-toto;
* Sigstore;
* SPDX;
* CycloneDX.

These are reference frameworks and standards unless formally adopted.

---

## SLSA

Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts provides concepts related to:

* build provenance;
* trusted build environments;
* tamper resistance;
* source-to-artifact traceability.

FamilyOS provenance architecture should remain capable of adopting SLSA-compatible approaches.

---

## in-toto

in-toto provides concepts for securing software supply-chain steps through attestations and verified workflow metadata.

Its model may inform future FamilyOS provenance and release evidence design.

---

## Sigstore

Sigstore provides technologies and patterns for software artifact signing and verification.

Potential future FamilyOS use may include:

* keyless signing;
* transparency logs;
* signature verification.

Specific adoption requires separate security architecture decisions.

---

## SPDX

SPDX provides standardized software package and Software Bill of Materials representations.

FamilyOS may use SPDX-compatible SBOM formats in future executable release profiles.

---

## CycloneDX

CycloneDX provides software bill of materials and supply-chain metadata formats.

FamilyOS may support CycloneDX where useful for dependency and security visibility.

---

## SBOM References

Software Bill of Materials standards may support:

* dependency inventory;
* vulnerability analysis;
* software supply-chain transparency;
* release provenance.

SBOM generation is a future maturity capability unless made mandatory by a release profile.

---

## Cryptographic Hash References

Artifact integrity may use secure cryptographic hashes such as SHA-256.

Hash algorithms should be selected according to current security guidance.

The Release Framework intentionally does not hard-code one algorithm permanently.

---

## Signing References

Release signing mechanisms may include:

* Git tag signing;
* artifact signing;
* signed checksums;
* provenance signing;
* package-specific signatures.

Signing architecture must include key or identity governance.

---

## NIST References

Where security and software supply-chain governance mature, FamilyOS may consult applicable NIST guidance.

Potentially relevant areas include:

* secure software development;
* software supply-chain security;
* risk management;
* cryptographic practices.

External security guidance must be evaluated against FamilyOS architecture before normative adoption.

---

## OWASP References

OWASP guidance may inform:

* CI/CD security;
* dependency security;
* secret handling;
* software supply-chain threats;
* application security.

OWASP recommendations are external references rather than automatic Release Framework requirements.

---

## Secure Software Development Framework

The NIST Secure Software Development Framework may provide useful reference concepts for:

* secure build environments;
* provenance;
* release integrity;
* vulnerability response.

FamilyOS may progressively align where appropriate.

---

## Risk Management References

Release risk management may draw on general engineering risk concepts such as:

```text
likelihood
impact
severity
mitigation
acceptance
residual risk
```

The authoritative FamilyOS release risk model is defined in:

```text
24-Release-Risk-Management.md
```

External risk frameworks remain advisory unless formally adopted.

---

## Security Severity References

Security vulnerability severity may use industry-standard concepts such as CVSS where relevant.

CVSS scoring should not automatically determine release governance decisions without FamilyOS policy interpretation.

---

## Compliance References

External compliance standards may eventually affect FamilyOS release processes depending on deployment context.

Examples may include:

* software supply-chain regulations;
* security certification requirements;
* audit requirements;
* privacy requirements.

Such obligations must be introduced through explicit FamilyOS compliance governance.

---

## Release Evidence References

Future release evidence models may draw on:

* build attestations;
* provenance standards;
* package metadata;
* Git metadata;
* CI/CD logs;
* compliance evidence;
* approval records.

The Release Framework should prefer structured evidence over long-term dependence on raw terminal output.

---

## Observability References

Release observability may use common telemetry standards in future implementation.

Potential references include:

* OpenTelemetry;
* structured logging;
* event-driven lifecycle telemetry.

The exact observability implementation is outside this document.

---

## OpenTelemetry

OpenTelemetry may provide a common model for:

* traces;
* metrics;
* logs;
* release events.

Release telemetry should remain consistent with FamilyOS Observability Architecture if OpenTelemetry is adopted.

---

## Release Event References

Future FamilyOS release events may include conceptual event names such as:

```text
release.planned
release.ready
release.candidate.created
release.validated
release.approved
release.published
release.completed
release.failed
```

These names are conceptual until defined by a formal specification.

---

## Artifact Repository References

Artifact registries typically provide concepts such as:

* immutable versions;
* package metadata;
* digest identity;
* promotion;
* retention;
* deprecation or withdrawal.

FamilyOS should use these capabilities where they reinforce Release Framework semantics.

---

## Container References

If FamilyOS later distributes container images, release architecture may use:

* image digests;
* immutable tags;
* OCI metadata;
* image signing;
* SBOM;
* provenance.

Mutable container tags such as `latest` must remain separate from immutable release identities.

---

## OCI References

Open Container Initiative standards may become relevant to container artifact formats and distribution.

Specific OCI adoption belongs to future implementation architecture.

---

## Documentation References

FamilyOS reference documentation under:

```text
docs/04-reference/
```

provides shared terminology and naming conventions.

Important documents include:

```text
docs/04-reference/Glossary.md
docs/04-reference/Acronyms.md
docs/04-reference/Language.md
docs/04-reference/Naming-Conventions.md
docs/04-reference/Reserved-Words.md
docs/04-reference/Reference-Index.md
```

EPIC-REL-001 terminology should remain aligned with these references.

---

## Glossary

```text
docs/04-reference/Glossary.md
```

Release-specific terminology should eventually be added or aligned with the central FamilyOS glossary where appropriate.

---

## Acronyms

Reference:

```text
docs/04-reference/Acronyms.md
```

Relevant acronyms may include:

```text
CI
CD
SBOM

```

---

## Language

Reference:

```text
docs/04-reference/Language.md
```

EPIC-REL-001 should follow official FamilyOS documentation language rules.

---

## Naming Conventions

Reference:

```text
docs/04-reference/Naming-Conventions.md
```

This applies to:

* document names;
* identifiers;
* release profile names;
* tags;
* future automation interfaces.

---

## Reserved Words

Reference:

```text
docs/04-reference/Reserved-Words.md
```

Future release metadata and CLI interfaces should avoid conflicts with reserved terminology.

---

## Reference Index

Reference:

```text
docs/04-reference/Reference-Index.md
```

The central reference index should eventually include EPIC-REL-001 and its associated concepts.

---

## Reference Stability

References should use stable identifiers wherever possible.

Preferred:

```text
EPIC-REL-001
ADR-0007
RFC-0015
SPEC-0005
```

Less preferred:

```text
that release document
the plugin ADR
the old spec
```

Stable identifiers improve long-term traceability.

---

## Reference Versioning

Where a referenced document is itself versioned, release decisions should identify the applicable version where necessary.

For example:

```text
Release Framework governed by:
EPIC-REL-001 version X
```

This becomes increasingly important as FamilyOS frameworks evolve.

---

## External Reference Adoption

An external standard becomes a normative FamilyOS requirement only through explicit adoption.

The sequence should be:

```text
external standard
      ↓
FamilyOS architectural evaluation
      ↓
ADR / RFC / framework decision where required
      ↓
FamilyOS normative rule
```

Reference alone does not imply mandatory compliance.

---

## External Standard Evolution

External standards may evolve independently.

FamilyOS must not allow an external mutable reference to silently change internal normative requirements.

Where necessary, FamilyOS should reference a specific standard version.

---

## Deprecated References

If a referenced FamilyOS document is superseded:

* the replacement should be identified;
* historical release interpretation should remain possible;
* obsolete references should be updated in future framework versions.

---

## Broken References

Broken references reduce framework usability and traceability.

Framework validation should eventually detect:

* missing local documents;
* renamed references;
* invalid identifiers;
* obsolete structural references.

---

## Reference Validation

Before EPIC-REL-001 release, reference validation should confirm that:

```text
required FamilyOS references exist
internal filenames are correct
EPIC identifiers are correct
ADR identifiers are correct where cited
RFC identifiers are correct where cited
cross-document references are coherent
```

External web availability should not be required for every framework validation unless policy explicitly requires it.

---

## Reference Governance

Changes to important normative references may require Release Framework review.

For example, if:

```text
EPIC-BLD-001
```

changes artifact identity rules, then:

```text
11-Artifacts-and-Provenance.md
```

may require reassessment.

---

## Dependency Between Frameworks

The relationship between FamilyOS engineering frameworks may be represented conceptually as:

```text
Engineering Foundation
        ↓
Build Framework
Testing Framework
Quality Framework
Documentation Framework
Plugin Compliance Framework
        ↓
Release Framework
```

The Release Framework consumes evidence from these frameworks and coordinates final release transitions.

---

## Release Framework as Integration Layer

EPIC-REL-001 should be understood as an integration framework across several engineering domains.

It does not replace them.

Conceptually:

```text
Build
Tests
Quality
Security
Compliance
Documentation
Governance
        ↓
Release Qualification
        ↓
Official Release
```

---

## Tool References

Specific tools may appear in implementation examples, including:

```text
git
pytest
ruff
mypy
Python packaging tools
CI/CD platforms
```

These tools are implementation references.

The Release Framework must remain meaningful if tooling changes.

---

## Current FamilyOS Toolchain Context

Current FamilyOS engineering commonly uses:

```text
Python
pytest
Ruff
MyPy
Git
```

These tools may provide release evidence.

Their exact versions and configuration are governed by the appropriate engineering and build frameworks.

## Reference Portability

The Release Framework must avoid depending on assumptions that only hold on one operating system, CI/CD provider, package registry, or Git hosting platform.

External reference material should support portability.

---

## Future Reference Categories

As FamilyOS matures, additional reference categories may become necessary.

Examples include:

* release manifest specification;
* provenance specification;
* compatibility specification;
* signing policy;
* support lifecycle policy;
* package distribution policy;
* platform release profile specification.

These should be added explicitly rather than embedded informally in automation.

---

## Reference Maintenance

This document should be reviewed when:

* new frameworks are introduced;
* relevant ADRs are approved;
* new specifications are published;
* release architecture changes;
* external standards become normative;
* references are renamed or retired.

---

## Reference Invariants

The following invariants apply.

### REF1 — FamilyOS-specific release behavior is governed by FamilyOS normative sources.

### REF2 — External standards are informative unless explicitly adopted.

### REF3 — Stable identifiers should be used for internal references.

### REF4 — Historical reference meaning must remain reconstructable.

### REF5 — Referenced framework changes may trigger Release Framework reassessment.

### REF6 — Implementation tools must not become normative merely because they are referenced.

### REF7 — Internal cross-references must remain consistent with the canonical Release Framework structure.

### REF8 — Reference changes must not silently redefine release policy.

---

## Reference Anti-Patterns

### Link Equals Policy

Assuming an external webpage automatically defines FamilyOS behavior.

---

### Mutable External Dependency

Depending on an unspecified latest version of an external standard for normative meaning.

---

### Tool Documentation as Architecture

Treating GitHub Actions, registry, or package-manager documentation as the Release Framework.

---

### Broken Internal Reference

Renaming a canonical framework document without updating dependent references.

---

### Historical Reference Rewrite

Changing old release records to point to new framework rules that did not govern those releases.

---

### Duplicate Normative Definition

Copying rules from another framework and redefining them differently inside EPIC-REL-001.

---

## Minimum Reference Set

At minimum, EPIC-REL-001 should remain traceable to:

```text
FamilyOS Engineering Constitution
Engineering Foundation
Build Framework
Testing Framework
Quality Framework
Documentation Framework
Plugin Compliance Framework
applicable ADRs
applicable specifications
Git
semantic versioning concepts
software supply-chain references
```

---

## Target Reference Experience

A future maintainer reviewing EPIC-REL-001 should be able to determine:

```text
Which FamilyOS foundations constrain this framework?

Which engineering frameworks provide release evidence?

Which ADRs influence architecture?

Which specifications define formal contracts?

Which external standards influenced provenance and security?

Which references are normative and which are advisory?
```

This document provides the reference map required to answer those questions.

---

## Final Statement

The FamilyOS Release Framework does not exist in isolation.

It integrates engineering architecture, build outputs, testing evidence, quality gates, documentation standards, plugin compliance, security, governance, repository state, and external software supply-chain practices into one controlled release capability.

`27-References.md` preserves the traceability between EPIC-REL-001 and those surrounding sources.

By maintaining clear internal precedence, stable identifiers, explicit external-standard adoption, and durable cross-framework relationships, FamilyOS ensures that Release Framework evolution remains understandable, governable, and architecturally consistent over time.
