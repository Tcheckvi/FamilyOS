# Release Framework

## 14 CI/CD Integration

### Overview

EPIC-REL-001 — Release Framework defines CI/CD Integration as the controlled use of continuous integration and continuous delivery systems to execute, enforce, observe, and record release workflows.

CI/CD systems provide an execution environment for release automation.

They do not define release semantics by themselves.

The intended relationship is:

```text id="7w5az1"
Release Framework
      ↓
Release Policy
      ↓
Release Workflow
      ↓
CI/CD Pipeline
```

The inverse relationship is not acceptable:

```text id="bbcpnn"
CI/CD YAML
      ↓
implicit release behavior
      ↓
de facto release policy
```

The Release Framework remains authoritative.

CI/CD implements it.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of CI/CD Integration is to establish:

* release pipeline boundaries;
* CI responsibilities;
* CD responsibilities;
* validation integration;
* candidate handling;
* approval integration;
* artifact handling;
* credential protection;
* environment isolation;
* publication controls;
* pipeline state;
* failure handling;
* evidence retention;
* branch and tag protections;
* release profile integration;
* post-publication verification.

The objective is to make release execution repeatable without coupling FamilyOS release semantics to one CI/CD provider.

---

## CI/CD Principle

The central principle is:

> CI/CD is an execution mechanism for the Release Framework, not the source of release policy.

A pipeline may encode release steps.

The meaning and necessity of those steps must remain documented in EPIC-REL-001 and related governance.

---

## Continuous Integration Responsibility

Continuous Integration primarily verifies engineering state.

Typical CI responsibilities include:

* source validation;
* dependency setup;
* build execution;
* test execution;
* static analysis;
* documentation validation;
* compliance checks;
* artifact generation;
* evidence generation.

CI answers questions such as:

```text id="s7ktqv"
Does the source build?

Do the tests pass?

Do quality checks pass?

Are required documents valid?

Are generated artifacts correct?
```

---

## Continuous Delivery Responsibility

Continuous Delivery primarily prepares a validated release state for controlled publication.

Typical responsibilities may include:

* candidate creation;
* release validation;
* version checks;
* artifact verification;
* release metadata preparation;
* publication preparation;
* approval gates.

Continuous Delivery does not necessarily imply automatic publication.

---

## Continuous Deployment vs Release Publication

FamilyOS MUST distinguish between continuous deployment and release publication.

A release may be:

```text id="vm1dmp"
validated
approved
published
```

without being automatically deployed into all operational environments.

Similarly, deployment may occur independently from public release publication depending on platform architecture.

The Release Framework therefore avoids assuming:

```text id="18sol3"
release == deployment
```

---

## Pipeline Architecture

A canonical release pipeline may contain the following stages:

```text id="gwpv1a"
SOURCE
  ↓
BUILD
  ↓
TEST
  ↓
QUALITY
  ↓
SECURITY
  ↓
COMPLIANCE
  ↓
PACKAGE
  ↓
READINESS
  ↓
CANDIDATE
  ↓
RELEASE VALIDATION
  ↓
APPROVAL
  ↓
TAG
  ↓
PUBLISH
  ↓
VERIFY
```

Not every release profile requires every stage.

The pipeline must reflect the applicable release profile.

---

## Validation Pipelines

Validation pipelines are generally safe to execute frequently.

They should avoid unnecessary external release side effects.

Examples include:

```text id="fce3lu"
build
tests
linting
type checking
documentation validation
compliance
version validation
artifact verification
```

These pipelines may run on:

* commits;
* pull requests;
* merge requests;
* candidate branches;
* release requests.

---

## Publication Pipelines

Publication pipelines perform protected external actions.

Examples include:

* creating release tags;
* pushing release metadata;
* uploading artifacts;
* publishing packages;
* creating repository releases;
* updating channels.

Publication pipelines MUST have stronger authorization than ordinary CI validation.

---

## Separation of Validation and Publication

Where practical, FamilyOS SHOULD separate:

```text id="8prgyz"
validation pipeline
```

from:

```text id="eh00op"
publication pipeline
```

This allows extensive validation without granting publication privileges to every CI execution.

---

## Pipeline Trust Levels

Different pipeline stages have different trust requirements.

Conceptually:

```text id="1n1mtu"
Untrusted / Lower Trust
├── pull request validation
├── formatting checks
├── unit tests

Controlled
├── protected branch validation
├── candidate build
├── release validation

Privileged
├── tag creation
├── package publication
├── stable promotion
```

Credentials and permissions should reflect these trust levels.

---

## Pull Request Pipelines

Pull request or merge request pipelines SHOULD normally run without release publication credentials.

They may verify:

* build;
* tests;
* static analysis;
* documentation;
* compliance;
* release metadata changes.

They MUST NOT normally be able to publish official releases.

---

## Protected Branch Pipelines

Protected branch pipelines may provide stronger release evidence because they operate on accepted repository state.

They may generate:

* authoritative build artifacts;
* candidate artifacts;
* readiness evidence;
* candidate provenance.

Access and mutation rules should be stricter than for ordinary development branches.

---

## Candidate Pipelines

A Release Candidate pipeline should operate on an explicit candidate source state.

Inputs should identify:

```text id="9ikodg"
candidate ID
source revision
target version
release profile
```

The pipeline should not implicitly select:

```text id="2q27sq"
latest commit
```

without binding it to candidate identity.

---

## Candidate Pipeline Output

A candidate pipeline may produce:

```text id="m9dkqi"
candidate artifacts
checksums
build identity
validation evidence
release manifest
candidate metadata
```

These outputs should remain associated with the exact candidate.

---

## Stable Publication Pipeline

A stable publication pipeline should only execute after applicable validation and approval.

Conceptually:

```text id="bx1s0o"
Candidate Validated
      ↓
Approval Granted
      ↓
Publication Pipeline Enabled
```

A stable pipeline MUST NOT independently reinterpret an unvalidated branch as release-ready.

---

## Pipeline Triggers

CI/CD pipelines may be triggered by:

* commit;
* pull request;
* branch update;
* tag;
* manual release request;
* release manifest;
* scheduled process.

Trigger type alone must not determine release authority.

---

## Tag-Triggered Pipelines

Tag-triggered pipelines are common.

However, FamilyOS should avoid an architecture where:

```text id="8lc2wh"
someone creates tag
       ↓
pipeline blindly publishes
```

without validating that the tag represents an approved release.

A tag-triggered publication workflow should verify:

* tag format;
* tag target;
* version;
* approval state;
* candidate identity;
* release policy.

---

## Release Request Trigger

A stronger future model may use an explicit Release Request.

Conceptually:

```text id="j5l62r"
release request
      ↓
readiness
      ↓
candidate
      ↓
validation
      ↓
approval
      ↓
publication
```

The Release Request may become the entry point for orchestration.

---

## Manual Pipeline Trigger

Manual triggers MAY be appropriate for controlled release workflows.

The trigger should require explicit inputs such as:

* version;
* candidate;
* release profile;
* target channel.

Manual trigger must not imply manual policy bypass.

---

## Scheduled Pipelines

Scheduled release jobs may be useful for:

* nightly builds;
* development releases;
* maintenance checks;
* readiness reassessment.

Scheduled jobs should not automatically perform stable publication unless governance explicitly permits it.

---

## Branch Protection

Release-sensitive branches SHOULD use repository protection where supported.

Protections may include:

* restricted direct pushes;
* required validation;
* review requirements;
* branch status checks;
* protected release branches.

Branch protection reinforces release governance.

---

## Tag Protection

Official release tags SHOULD be protected where the repository platform supports it.

Protections may restrict:

* who may create official tags;
* who may delete tags;
* who may force-update tags.

Stable tags should be especially protected.

---

## Repository Synchronization

Before publication, the CI/CD workflow should verify that the release source state is available in the authoritative repository.

For example:

```text id="bydo4f"
candidate commit
=
remote repository commit
```

This prevents release artifacts from referencing unpublished local state.

---

## Working Tree Concerns

CI/CD environments normally operate from a clean checkout.

This provides stronger source cleanliness than many local workflows.

However, pipelines must still ensure that:

* generated files do not modify release source unexpectedly;
* required generated artifacts are accounted for;
* build outputs are kept separate from source state.

---

## Reproducible Checkout

CI/CD workflows SHOULD use deterministic source checkout.

Relevant elements may include:

* exact commit SHA;
* submodule revision;
* dependency lock state;
* repository fetch depth sufficient for required checks.

A moving branch ref should be resolved to an exact commit before candidate qualification.

---

## CI Build Environment

Release-critical CI environments should be controlled.

Possible controls include:

* pinned runner image;
* explicit runtime version;
* dependency lockfiles;
* controlled build tools;
* containerized execution;
* reproducible setup scripts.

Hidden environment drift can change release results.

---

## Runner Trust

Publication jobs SHOULD run only on trusted execution environments.

Untrusted external runners should not receive sensitive release credentials.

This is particularly important for:

* package publishing;
* signing;
* tag creation;
* stable channel updates.

---

## Ephemeral Runners

Ephemeral release runners are preferred where practical because they reduce persistent contamination between releases.

Benefits include:

* cleaner state;
* reduced secret persistence;
* less environment drift;
* improved reproducibility.

---

## Environment Separation

FamilyOS SHOULD separate lower-trust and privileged release environments.

Example:

```text id="rgj4l2"
Validation Environment
      ↓
no publish credentials

Publication Environment
      ↓
scoped release credentials
```

This limits the impact of compromised validation jobs.

---

## Credential Injection

CI/CD release credentials should be injected at runtime through secure secret mechanisms.

Credentials MUST NOT be:

* stored in repository files;
* embedded in pipeline YAML;
* printed to logs;
* exposed to untrusted pipeline stages.

---

## Credential Scope

Credentials should be scoped to the smallest required capability.

Examples:

```text id="5h060m"
repository release token
package registry publish token
documentation publish token
```

A single unrestricted release credential should be avoided where possible.

---

## Credential Availability

Privileged credentials should only become available after protected gates.

For example:

```text id="z55n1k"
build
test
validate
      ↓
approval
      ↓
privileged publication job
```

This reduces accidental credential exposure.

---

## Environment Approval

Some CI/CD systems support protected environments requiring approval before access to secrets or publication.

FamilyOS MAY use such capabilities as an implementation of Release Governance.

The governance meaning must remain documented outside the provider configuration.

---

## Approval Gate Integration

A release pipeline may pause between validation and publication.

Example:

```text id="8y2pr1"
VALIDATED
   ↓
WAITING FOR APPROVAL
   ↓
APPROVED
   ↓
publication pipeline
```

Approval should identify the candidate and release scope.

---

## Approval Invalidation

If the candidate changes after approval:

```text id="s42pmh"
approval
  ↓
candidate changed
  ↓
approval invalid
```

The pipeline must not continue using approval bound to an earlier candidate.

---

## Pipeline Artifacts

CI systems often support internal pipeline artifacts.

These can be useful for:

* candidate packages;
* test reports;
* checksums;
* release manifests;
* validation results;
* provenance.

Pipeline artifacts are not automatically official release artifacts.

---

## Pipeline Artifact Promotion

The preferred model is:

```text id="q3no1m"
CI builds candidate artifact
      ↓
candidate validated
      ↓
same artifact promoted
      ↓
official publication
```

This avoids rebuilding after qualification.

---

## Artifact Download and Reupload

If publication jobs retrieve artifacts from a previous validation job, the workflow should verify checksums.

Conceptually:

```text id="h1xs8f"
validation digest
=
publication digest
```

This protects artifact identity across pipeline boundaries.

---

## Build Once Pipeline Model

A strong pipeline architecture is:

```text id="tqsixa"
Source
  ↓
Build Once
  ↓
Store Candidate Artifact
  ↓
Validate Candidate Artifact
  ↓
Approve
  ↓
Publish Stored Artifact
```

This provides strong candidate-to-release continuity.

---

## Rebuild Pipeline Risk

A weaker pattern is:

```text id="xwfhvs"
CI build
   ↓
tests pass
   ↓
publication job rebuilds
   ↓
publishes new artifact
```

The published artifact may differ from the validated one.

If rebuilding cannot be avoided, renewed verification is required.

---

## Pipeline Evidence

CI/CD should preserve evidence required for release decisions.

Evidence may include:

* job results;
* test reports;
* candidate identity;
* source revision;
* build metadata;
* checksums;
* compliance results;
* publication logs;
* verification results.

---

## Evidence Retention

Pipeline logs may have limited retention.

Critical release evidence SHOULD therefore be copied or represented in a more durable release evidence system where required.

Important historical release facts must not depend exclusively on temporary CI logs.

---

## Structured Pipeline Output

Jobs should produce structured outputs where practical.

Example:

```text id="0kqhvh"
candidate_id=5.2.0-rc.3
source_revision=abc123
artifact_sha256=...
validation_status=pass
```

These outputs can feed later controlled stages.

---

## Pipeline State

Pipeline status and release state are not the same.

For example:

```text id="e6p9nh"
pipeline: success
```

does not necessarily mean:

```text id="q8od1k"
release: completed
```

The pipeline may only have completed validation.

Release lifecycle state must remain explicit.

---

## Pipeline Failure Model

CI/CD failures should map to release states appropriately.

Examples:

```text id="f107u5"
build job failed
→ release BLOCKED
```

```text id="24r5ok"
artifact publication failed after tag creation
→ release FAILED
```

The pipeline should preserve enough context to determine the correct release state.

---

## Failed Pipeline Retry

Before retrying a failed release pipeline, the system should inspect previous side effects.

For example:

```text id="hy2rvn"
tag already created
package publication failed
```

Retry must not recreate or overwrite release identity blindly.

---

## Job Idempotency

Publication jobs should be designed for safe re-execution.

Examples:

```text id="uhv9nb"
tag exists and matches expected commit
→ continue

tag exists and differs
→ fail
```

```text id="3khwv8"
package exists with same digest
→ verify

package exists with different digest
→ block
```

---

## Pipeline Concurrency

Concurrent release pipelines may create race conditions.

Examples include:

* same version selected twice;
* same candidate number selected twice;
* stable channel updated by competing workflows;
* tag created concurrently.

Release pipelines SHOULD use concurrency controls where appropriate.

---

## Release Locking

Future CI/CD integration may use a release lock.

Conceptually:

```text id="hm37ua"
Release 5.2.0
      ↓
lock acquired
      ↓
publication
      ↓
lock released
```

The exact implementation is provider-specific.

---

## Version Reservation

CI/CD orchestration MAY reserve a version before final publication to prevent parallel conflicts.

Reservation is not publication.

A stale reservation must be recoverable.

---

## Candidate Concurrency

Candidate creation should similarly prevent:

```text id="hrhqqw"
workflow A → rc.3
workflow B → rc.3
```

under the same target version.

---

## Pipeline Caching

CI caching can improve speed.

However, release-critical caches must not introduce uncontrolled artifacts or stale dependencies.

Cache usage should be:

* deterministic;
* invalidated appropriately;
* verified where necessary.

---

## Dependency Caching

Dependency caches should not bypass lockfile or integrity verification.

A cached dependency remains subject to release dependency policy.

---

## Test Matrix Integration

CI/CD may execute release validation across a support matrix.

Examples include:

```text id="trfvzr"
Python 3.13
Python 3.14

macOS
Linux

architecture combinations
```

The required matrix is defined by compatibility and testing policy.

---

## Required Jobs

Release profiles should define which CI jobs are mandatory.

For example:

```text id="00mtmk"
framework-release:
  documentation-validation
  structure-validation
  repository-validation

plugin-release:
  build
  unit-tests
  integration-tests
  compliance
  artifact-validation
```

Provider syntax may differ.

The logical profile must remain stable.

---

## Optional Jobs

Some jobs may be advisory.

Examples include:

* extended performance analysis;
* optional compatibility environments;
* experimental static analysis.

The pipeline should clearly distinguish blocking and non-blocking results.

---

## Status Check Semantics

Repository platform status checks can enforce release prerequisites.

However, status names should correspond to documented release requirements.

A required check should not exist only because someone once added it to branch protection.

---

## Pipeline Templates

FamilyOS SHOULD reuse CI/CD templates where release patterns repeat.

Templates may reduce:

* configuration duplication;
* policy drift;
* inconsistent credential handling;
* inconsistent artifact processing.

Templates must remain versioned and reviewed.

---

## Framework Pipeline Template

A future framework release template may provide:

```text id="o1ledn"
validate-structure
validate-docs
validate-control-files
validate-version
validate-repository
prepare-release
publish-tag
verify-tag
```

---

## Plugin Pipeline Template

A plugin template may provide:

```text id="74w5g4"
build
test
compliance
package
checksum
candidate
validate
publish
verify
```

---

## Platform Pipeline Template

A platform release may orchestrate several component pipelines.

Conceptually:

```text id="zm2gh7"
Core Pipeline
Plugin Pipelines
Documentation Pipeline
Compatibility Validation
        ↓
Platform Candidate
        ↓
Platform Release Pipeline
```

---

## Parent and Child Pipelines

Complex FamilyOS releases may eventually use parent-child pipeline architecture.

A parent release workflow may coordinate:

* core validation;
* plugin validation;
* documentation validation;
* artifact collection.

The parent must preserve component evidence and candidate identities.

---

## Multi-Repository Pipelines

Future FamilyOS architecture may involve multiple repositories.

The Release Framework should remain compatible with orchestration that binds:

```text id="pnn59u"
repository A revision
repository B revision
repository C revision
```

into one platform candidate.

Each repository state must remain explicit.

---

## External Services

Release pipelines may interact with external systems.

Examples include:

* package registries;
* Git hosting;
* artifact storage;
* documentation hosting;
* signing services.

External service failure must be represented as release state, not hidden by pipeline abstraction.

---

## Service Availability

A release may be blocked or fail due to publication target availability.

Pipelines should distinguish:

```text id="9g6xyd"
candidate invalid
```

from:

```text id="o98tft"
publication infrastructure unavailable
```

These require different recovery actions.

---

## Network Failure

Release automation must assume network operations may fail after remote changes have partially completed.

Retry logic should verify remote state before repeating operations.

---

## Pipeline Timeouts

Timeouts should produce explicit failed or blocked state.

A timeout does not prove that the remote action did not complete.

Recovery may need to query the publication target.

---

## Post-Publication Pipeline

After publication, CI/CD may execute verification jobs.

These may check:

* remote tag;
* package existence;
* artifact checksum;
* release notes;
* stable channel;
* installation from public registry.

Only after applicable verification passes should the release progress toward completion.

---

## Public Installation Test

For package releases, a strong post-publication check is installation through the same distribution path used by consumers.

Conceptually:

```text id="stwrhb"
publish package
      ↓
clean environment
      ↓
install published version
      ↓
smoke test
```

This validates the actual published artifact.

---

## Pipeline Release Evidence Summary

A completed release workflow may produce:

```text id="uvk2ow"
Release            5.2.0
Candidate          5.2.0-rc.3
Source             abc123

Build              PASS
Tests              PASS
Quality            PASS
Security           PASS
Compliance         PASS
Artifacts          VERIFIED
Approval           GRANTED
Tag                VERIFIED
Publication        VERIFIED
Post-Release       PASS

RESULT             COMPLETED
```

---

## CI/CD Observability

Release pipeline interfaces should make it easy to identify:

* current lifecycle state;
* current candidate;
* failed stage;
* blocking gate;
* publication status;
* recovery requirement.

Raw job lists alone are insufficient for mature release operations.

---

## Pipeline Event Model

CI/CD may emit events corresponding to release lifecycle.

Examples:

```text id="a8lvjk"
release.readiness.started
release.candidate.created
release.validation.passed
release.approved
release.publication.started
release.published
release.completed
```

The specific telemetry mechanism may vary.

---

## CI/CD Security

Release pipelines are part of the software supply chain.

Threats include:

* malicious pipeline modification;
* credential theft;
* untrusted runner access;
* dependency substitution;
* artifact replacement;
* unauthorized workflow triggering;
* tag manipulation.

Release pipeline security requires layered protection.

---

## Pipeline Configuration Protection

Changes to release pipeline definitions SHOULD receive appropriate review.

High-impact workflow changes may deserve stronger governance than ordinary code changes.

A pipeline change can alter how official artifacts are published.

---

## Workflow Pinning

Where pipelines use third-party actions, reusable jobs, or plugins, versions SHOULD be controlled.

Unpinned mutable dependencies can alter release behavior unexpectedly.

---

## Third-Party CI Components

External CI components must be treated as supply-chain dependencies.

Their trust, version, and permissions should be reviewed according to release risk.

---

## Secret Minimization

Jobs that do not require secrets MUST NOT receive them.

This includes:

* ordinary tests;
* linting;
* static analysis;
* most pull request validation.

---

## Untrusted Contribution Isolation

Pipelines executing code from untrusted contributions must be isolated from release credentials.

This is a critical supply-chain security boundary.

---

## Auditability

CI/CD release actions should make it possible to identify:

* triggering actor;
* pipeline version;
* source revision;
* candidate;
* approvals;
* privileged jobs;
* publication targets;
* final state.

This supports incident analysis and governance.

---

## Provider Independence

EPIC-REL-001 does not require a specific CI/CD platform.

Valid implementations may include:

* GitHub Actions;
* GitLab CI;
* Jenkins;
* Buildkite;
* another controlled platform.

The Release Framework defines semantics independently from provider syntax.

---

## Provider-Specific Capabilities

FamilyOS MAY use provider-specific capabilities such as:

* protected environments;
* approval gates;
* concurrency groups;
* artifact storage;
* secret stores.

These are implementation mechanisms.

The release requirements they satisfy must remain documented independently.

---

## CI/CD Migration

FamilyOS must be able to migrate CI/CD providers without redefining release semantics.

A migration may change:

```text id="uvqdkt"
pipeline syntax
runner technology
secret storage
artifact transfer
```

but should preserve:

```text id="osn7ak"
release lifecycle
release gates
candidate semantics
version rules
approval requirements
publication rules
```

---

## CI/CD and Release Profiles

Each release profile should map to a pipeline profile.

For example:

```text id="sxae8h"
Release Profile:
framework-release

Pipeline:
docs validation
structure validation
repository validation
approval
tagging
verification
```

---

## Framework Release CI/CD

For current FamilyOS framework releases, CI/CD integration can mature incrementally.

Initial automation may validate:

```text id="odl3ev"
file structure
empty files
duplicate numbering
Markdown standards
control documents
repository state
version format
```

Later automation may support controlled tagging and publication.

---

## Plugin Release CI/CD

Official plugin release pipelines should eventually integrate:

```text id="5dpu4x"
plugin build
plugin unit tests
integration tests
plugin compliance
artifact packaging
artifact checksum
candidate creation
publication
verification
```

---

## Platform Release CI/CD

A mature platform release pipeline may coordinate:

```text id="6rhfjd"
core artifacts
official plugins
documentation
specifications
compatibility
security
provenance
```

before producing the platform release.

---

## Emergency Release CI/CD

An emergency pipeline may use an accelerated profile.

It should retain:

* protected source;
* focused validation;
* explicit emergency approval;
* secure credentials;
* publication verification;
* recovery evidence.

Emergency release pipelines should exist before incidents occur where practical.

---

## Security Release CI/CD

Security-sensitive pipelines may require:

* restricted visibility;
* protected artifacts;
* limited logs;
* controlled disclosure timing;
* specialized security approval;
* coordinated publication.

The pipeline must avoid exposing vulnerability details prematurely.

---

## CI/CD Compliance

Future Release Compliance may evaluate pipeline requirements.

Examples include:

```text id="38lkku"
protected publication environment  PASS
release credentials scoped         PASS
candidate artifact reused          PASS
tag verified                       PASS
post-publication verification      PASS
```

---

## CI/CD Metrics

FamilyOS may track:

* pipeline release success rate;
* release job failure rate;
* retry rate;
* publication failure rate;
* validation duration;
* time waiting for approval;
* artifact reuse rate;
* privileged job count.

Metrics should improve reliability and security.

---

## CI/CD Maturity Model

FamilyOS CI/CD release integration may evolve through:

```text id="modiea"
Stage 1
manual local release

Stage 2
CI validation

Stage 3
CI readiness gates

Stage 4
candidate artifact storage

Stage 5
approval-gated publication

Stage 6
automated tagging and publishing

Stage 7
post-publication verification

Stage 8
structured release evidence

Stage 9
policy-driven pipeline orchestration

Stage 10
multi-component release coordination
```

---

## CI/CD Invariants

The following invariants apply.

### CICD1 — CI/CD implements release policy rather than defining it implicitly.

### CICD2 — Release pipelines operate on explicit source and candidate identities.

### CICD3 — Validation and privileged publication should be separated where practical.

### CICD4 — Untrusted jobs must not receive release credentials.

### CICD5 — Candidate artifact identity must survive pipeline boundaries.

### CICD6 — Published artifacts should match validated artifacts where practical.

### CICD7 — Approval must remain bound to the correct candidate.

### CICD8 — Pipeline success is not automatically release completion.

### CICD9 — Partial remote failure must remain observable.

### CICD10 — Retry operations must verify existing external state.

### CICD11 — Critical release evidence must outlive transient pipeline execution where required.

### CICD12 — CI/CD provider changes must not redefine release semantics.

---

## CI/CD Anti-Patterns

### Pipeline as Constitution

Treating CI/CD configuration as the only definition of the release process.

---

### Publish on Any Tag

Automatically publishing every matching tag without validating candidate and approval state.

---

### Secret Everywhere

Providing publication credentials to build and test jobs that do not need them.

---

### Rebuild in Publish Job

Publishing a newly rebuilt artifact after a different candidate artifact passed validation.

---

### Pipeline Success Equals Release Success

Declaring a release complete because all visible jobs are green without verifying publication state.

---

### Mutable Action Dependencies

Using unpinned third-party pipeline components for privileged release operations.

---

### Retry Without Inspection

Restarting failed release jobs without verifying remote state.

---

### Approval Detached From Candidate

Allowing publication after the approved candidate has changed.

---

### Temporary Logs as Permanent Evidence

Relying on short-lived pipeline output as the only historical release record.

---

## Minimum CI/CD Integration

A minimum useful FamilyOS CI/CD release integration should provide:

```text id="h2we2i"
source validation
build / documentation validation
required tests
quality checks
release profile checks
candidate evidence
version validation
```

while publication may initially remain manual.

---

## Intermediate CI/CD Integration

The next maturity step should add:

```text id="cpd84d"
candidate artifact retention
release validation
approval gate
protected release credentials
automated tag verification
publication preparation
```

## Target CI/CD Integration

A mature FamilyOS release pipeline should eventually support:

```text id="8kiq9w"
explicit release request
      ↓
profile selection
      ↓
readiness
      ↓
candidate build
      ↓
artifact storage
      ↓
candidate validation
      ↓
approval
      ↓
controlled publication
      ↓
post-publication verification
      ↓
release evidence
      ↓
completion
```

## Target Operator Experience

A release operator should eventually see a concise pipeline-level view such as:

```text id="3az5mj"
FamilyOS 6.0.0

Candidate            6.0.0-rc.2
Source               VERIFIED

Build                PASS
Tests                PASS
Quality              PASS
Security             PASS
Compliance           PASS
Artifacts            VERIFIED

Approval             GRANTED

Tag                  CREATED
Package Publication  VERIFIED
Documentation        VERIFIED
Stable Channel       VERIFIED

Release State        COMPLETED
```

Detailed evidence should remain available underneath this summary.

## Relationship With Release Automation

`13-Release-Automation.md` defines the general automation model.

This document defines how that automation operates in CI/CD environments.

---

## Relationship With Release Validation

`12-Release-Validation.md` defines the validation semantics that CI pipelines may execute.

---

## Relationship With Release Candidates

`10-Release-Candidates.md` defines candidate identity.

CI/CD must preserve candidate identity through builds, artifacts, validation, and publication.

---

## Relationship With Artifacts and Provenance

`11-Artifacts-and-Provenance.md` defines artifact identity and origin.

CI/CD is a major source of build and provenance evidence.

---

## Relationship With Tagging and Repository State

`16-Tagging-and-Repository-State.md` defines authoritative Git tag and repository semantics.

CI/CD tagging jobs must follow those rules.

---

## Relationship With Publishing and Distribution

`17-Publishing-and-Distribution.md` defines external publication semantics.

CI/CD publication jobs implement those transitions.

---

## Relationship With Release Security

`19-Release-Security.md` defines security requirements for CI/CD credentials, runners, pipelines, artifacts, and release authority.

---

## Relationship With Release Observability

`20-Release-Observability.md` defines how pipeline and release state become visible and historically reconstructable.

---

## Relationship With Release Governance

`21-Release-Governance.md` defines which CI/CD operations may run automatically and which require explicit authority.

---

## Final Statement

The FamilyOS CI/CD Integration model establishes continuous integration and continuous delivery systems as controlled execution environments for release engineering.

CI/CD provides repeatability, isolation, evidence, automation, and scalable enforcement.

It must not become an undocumented replacement for release architecture.

By separating validation from privileged publication, binding pipelines to explicit candidates, preserving artifact identity, protecting credentials, integrating approval gates, handling partial failures, and verifying publication results, FamilyOS can progressively move from manual release execution to reliable automated delivery without sacrificing governance, security, or traceability.
