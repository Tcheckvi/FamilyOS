# Release Framework

## 30 Release

### Overview

This document defines the final release model for EPIC-REL-001 — Release Framework.

It describes how the FamilyOS Release Framework itself is prepared, validated, accepted, versioned, tagged, published, and transitioned into an official engineering foundation.

The Release Framework is not complete when its documentation is merely written.

It becomes complete only when:

* its canonical structure is finished;
* its normative content is validated;
* its framework relationships are coherent;
* blocking findings are resolved;
* release metadata is synchronized;
* final validation succeeds;
* the repository state is clean;
* the framework is committed;
* the framework version is tagged;
* the release is published according to FamilyOS governance.

The governing principle is:

> The Release Framework must itself be released according to the engineering discipline that it defines.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to establish the final release procedure for EPIC-REL-001.

It defines:

* release eligibility;
* framework completion criteria;
* final validation;
* release preparation;
* metadata synchronization;
* version assignment;
* commit requirements;
* tag creation;
* release evidence;
* publication;
* post-release verification;
* rollback considerations;
* release closure.

This document is the transition point between framework construction and framework adoption.

---

## Release Scope

The release governed by this document includes the complete EPIC-REL-001 Release Framework.

The scope includes all canonical framework artifacts located under:

```text
docs/epics/EPIC-REL-001-release-framework/
```

The release scope includes:

* normative numbered documents;
* framework metadata;
* manifest information;
* validation artifacts;
* changelog information;
* revision history;
* framework summary;
* release checklist;
* supporting references where applicable.

The released framework must represent one coherent repository state.

---

## Release Objective

The objective of the EPIC-REL-001 release is to establish the Release Framework as an official FamilyOS engineering foundation.

After release, the framework becomes the normative reference for:

* release preparation;
* release candidates;
* release readiness;
* versioning;
* release gates;
* release approvals;
* artifact promotion;
* deployment;
* post-deployment verification;
* rollback and recovery;
* observability;
* compliance;
* metrics;
* risk management;
* release governance.

Future FamilyOS releases should progressively align with this framework.

---

## Release Eligibility

EPIC-REL-001 becomes eligible for release only when all mandatory framework requirements are satisfied.

At minimum:

```text
framework_structure_complete == true
required_documents_present == true
required_documents_non_empty == true
blocking_findings == 0
validation_complete == true
metadata_consistent == true
repository_state_verified == true
```

Eligibility is a prerequisite for release preparation.

It does not itself constitute release authorization.

---

## Canonical Release State

The framework release must correspond to one exact source-control state.

The canonical release identity must be traceable through:

```text
Repository
    |
    v
Commit
    |
    v
Release Tag
    |
    v
Framework Version
```

A released framework must never refer ambiguously to:

```text
latest
current
working copy
local version
```

The exact commit and tag must define the official state.

---

## Release Preconditions

Before final release preparation begins, the following conditions should be satisfied:

```text
[ ] All planned documents are created
[ ] No canonical document is empty
[ ] Numbering is correct
[ ] No duplicate numbered documents exist
[ ] Framework terminology is consistent
[ ] Cross-document references are valid
[ ] Required metadata is complete
[ ] Final validation has been performed
[ ] Blocking validation findings are resolved
[ ] Release version is known
```

If these conditions are not satisfied, release preparation should stop.

---

## Final Structural Review

The framework inventory must be reviewed one final time.

The review should verify:

* expected document count;
* expected numbered document sequence;
* supporting metadata files;
* duplicate numbering;
* unexpected files;
* empty files;
* filename consistency.

Example validation commands may include:

```bash
EPIC_DIR="docs/epics/EPIC-REL-001-release-framework"

tree "$EPIC_DIR"

find "$EPIC_DIR" -maxdepth 1 -type f | sort

find "$EPIC_DIR" -maxdepth 1 -type f -empty -print
```

The canonical inventory should be compared with the framework manifest.

---

## Numbering Verification

Numbered documents must be checked for uniqueness.

Example:

```bash
find "$EPIC_DIR" -maxdepth 1 -type f \
  -name '[0-9][0-9]-*.md' \
  -exec basename {} \; | sort
```

Duplicate numeric prefixes must be resolved before release.

Release publication must not proceed with conflicting canonical document numbers.

---

## Content Verification

Final content review should confirm that documents are substantive and not placeholders.

Checks should focus on:

* incomplete sections;
* unresolved TODOs;
* placeholder values;
* broken examples;
* inconsistent terminology;
* accidental duplicate content;
* malformed Markdown.

A non-empty file is not automatically release-ready.

---

## Placeholder Detection

Where practical, the framework should be checked for unresolved markers such as:

```text
TODO
TBD
FIXME
PLACEHOLDER
TO BE DEFINED
```

Some intentional references may legitimately use such terminology in examples.

Therefore, detected occurrences require review rather than unconditional automated rejection.

---

## Cross-Document Review

The final release review must ensure that all major release concepts remain consistent across the framework.

Priority areas include:

* release lifecycle;
* release states;
* readiness;
* release gates;
* approval;
* compliance;
* rollback;
* observability;
* risk;
* metrics.

Conflicting normative rules must be resolved before release.

---

## Framework Relationship Review

The Release Framework must be aligned with existing FamilyOS foundations.

Final review should confirm appropriate relationships with:

* Engineering Foundation;
* Documentation Framework;
* Testing Framework;
* Quality Framework;
* Build Framework;
* Plugin Compliance Framework;
* security architecture;
* applicable ADRs and RFCs.

The Release Framework must not silently redefine responsibilities owned by those foundations.

---

## Final Validation

`28-Validation.md` defines the formal validation model.

Before release, its mandatory checks must be executed.

The target result is:

```text
PASS
```

or, where governance explicitly permits:

```text
PASS_WITH_FINDINGS
```

with no unresolved blocking findings.

A framework with:

```text
FAIL
```

or:

```text
PENDING
```

must not be published as complete.

---

## Validation Evidence

Final release evidence should include or reference:

* document inventory;
* empty-file verification;
* duplicate-number verification;
* heading verification;
* metadata validation;
* final framework validation status;
* unresolved findings;
* release commit;
* release tag.

Evidence must correspond to the actual state being released.

---

## Metadata Synchronization

All release-related metadata must describe the same framework state.

Relevant artifacts may include:

```text
EPIC.yaml
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
SUMMARY.md
README.md
```

Where present, these must be synchronized before release.

---

## EPIC Metadata

The EPIC metadata should identify at least:

* EPIC identifier;
* title;
* framework version;
* lifecycle status;
* ownership where applicable;
* deliverable inventory;
* relationships.

The release state should no longer indicate an earlier incomplete lifecycle state when the framework is officially released.

---

## Manifest Synchronization

The framework manifest should reflect the final canonical inventory.

It should not reference:

* deleted files;
* renamed files under obsolete names;
* missing documents;
* temporary artifacts.

The manifest becomes part of release evidence.

---

## Changelog Preparation

The changelog should record the framework release.

The entry should identify:

* version;
* release state;
* major capabilities introduced;
* significant structural changes;
* important validation or governance milestones.

The changelog should describe the framework as released, not as planned.

---

## Revision History

Revision history should record the framework's transition to its official release version.

At minimum, it should identify:

```text
Version
Date
Change
Status
```

The release entry should correspond to the final release tag.

---

## Validation Status Artifact

If a dedicated validation status file exists, it must be updated before release.

Example conceptual state:

```text
Validation Status: PASS
Framework: EPIC-REL-001
Version: <release-version>
Blocking Findings: 0
```

The exact format is governed by FamilyOS documentation conventions.

---

## Release Version

The framework must receive an explicit version.

Version selection should follow the FamilyOS release and versioning conventions.

A framework milestone that establishes the first official complete release may use an appropriate semantic version according to current repository strategy.

The version must remain consistent across:

* metadata;
* changelog;
* revision history;
* tag;
* release notes where applicable.

---

## Version Consistency

The final release validation should reject inconsistent states such as:

```text
EPIC.yaml        -> 1.0.0
CHANGELOG        -> 1.1.0
Revision History -> 1.0.0
Git Tag          -> v4.x.x
```

unless the repository explicitly distinguishes document version from platform milestone version.

If separate version dimensions exist, they must be clearly documented.

---

## Release Commit

The final release should correspond to a dedicated commit or a clearly identifiable final framework commit.

A release commit message should clearly state completion.

Conceptually:

```text
docs(release): complete EPIC-REL-001 Release Framework
```

The exact commit convention should follow FamilyOS repository standards.

---

## Pre-Commit Verification

Before creating the final commit:

```bash
git status --short
```

should be reviewed.

Only intended framework changes should remain.

Unexpected modifications must be investigated.

---

## Commit Review

After committing, verify:

```bash
git status
git log --oneline --decorate -3
```

The expected outcome is:

```text
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

before release tagging.

A dirty working tree should be investigated before final release.

---

## Release Tag

The official framework release must be associated with an immutable annotated Git tag.

Conceptually:

```bash
git tag -a <release-tag> \
  -m "EPIC-REL-001 Release Framework completed"
```

The exact tag name must follow the active FamilyOS versioning strategy.

---

## Tag Verification

Before publishing the tag, verify:

```bash
git show --stat <release-tag>
```

and confirm that the tag points to the intended release commit.

The release tag must not be created from an unintended commit.

---

## Tag Immutability

Once published, an official release tag must not be silently reassigned.

If a released framework requires correction, the preferred model is:

```text
Released Version
      |
      v
Corrective Commit
      |
      v
New Version
      |
      v
New Tag
```

rather than mutating the previous release identity.

---

## Remote Publication

The release commit and release tag should be pushed to the canonical remote.

Conceptually:

```bash
git push origin <branch>
git push origin <release-tag>
```

Publication should occur only after local release verification succeeds.

---

## Remote Verification

After push, verify that:

* branch contains the release commit;
* tag exists remotely;
* tag points to the expected commit;
* local and remote states are aligned.

Release completion should not rely solely on the push command returning without obvious error.

---

## Release Notes

Where a formal release entry is published, release notes should summarize the significance of EPIC-REL-001.

Release notes should describe:

* establishment of the FamilyOS Release Framework;
* release governance model;
* readiness and gate model;
* rollback and recovery;
* observability;
* compliance;
* metrics;
* risk management;
* roadmap.

The release notes should remain concise and link back to canonical framework documentation where applicable.

---

## Framework Release Evidence

The final framework release should be traceable through a minimal evidence chain:

```text
EPIC-REL-001
    |
    v
Validation PASS
    |
    v
Final Commit
    |
    v
Annotated Tag
    |
    v
Remote Publication
```

This proves both content completion and repository publication.

---

## Release Acceptance

The Release Framework is officially accepted when all mandatory release conditions are met.

Conceptually:

```text
structure_complete == true
content_complete == true
validation_passed == true
blocking_findings == 0
metadata_synchronized == true
commit_created == true
tag_created == true
remote_published == true
```

Only then should the EPIC lifecycle state be considered complete.

---

## Framework Status Transition

The framework lifecycle may transition conceptually through:

```text
DRAFT
  |
  v
IN_PROGRESS
  |
  v
VALIDATING
  |
  v
READY
  |
  v
RELEASED
```

The exact state names may depend on the FamilyOS EPIC metadata model.

The essential requirement is that the final state accurately reflects release completion.

---

## Post-Release Verification

After publication, the framework should undergo a final verification.

Checks should include:

* local tag exists;
* remote tag exists;
* working tree remains clean;
* release commit is reachable;
* canonical documents remain present;
* metadata reflects released status.

This confirms that the publication operation did not create inconsistencies.

---

## Post-Release Repository Check

A final repository check may include:

```bash
git status

git log --oneline --decorate -5

git tag --sort=-version:refname | head -n 15
```

The output should show:

* clean working tree;
* release commit at expected location;
* release tag visible.

---

## Release Failure

If release publication fails, the process must stop and determine the actual repository state.

Possible failures include:

* branch push failure;
* tag push failure;
* incorrect tag target;
* authentication failure;
* remote rejection;
* unexpected local modifications.

Do not recreate or overwrite release state blindly.

First determine what succeeded and what did not.

---

## Failed Tag Publication

If the branch push succeeds but tag push fails:

```text
Commit Published
      |
      v
Tag Publication Failed
```

the release is not fully published.

The correct response is to resolve the tag publication issue while preserving the already-published commit.

There is normally no reason to create a different release commit solely because the tag push failed.

---

## Incorrect Local Tag

If an unpublished local tag points to the wrong commit, it may be corrected before publication according to Git governance.

If the tag has already been published, it must be treated as a published release identifier and should not be silently rewritten.

A corrective version should normally be created.

---

## Release Rollback

The Release Framework itself is documentation and governance content.

Its rollback model therefore differs from production application rollback.

If a released framework version is found to contain a serious normative error, options include:

* corrective documentation release;
* new framework version;
* superseding governance decision;
* explicit deprecation of an invalid rule.

Historical released versions should remain traceable.

---

## Normative Correction

Material normative corrections should receive a new version.

Examples include changes to:

* release blocking requirements;
* security requirements;
* approval authority;
* rollback governance;
* compliance status semantics;
* release state semantics.

Silent modification of released normative behavior should be avoided.

---

## Editorial Correction

Minor editorial corrections may follow the applicable FamilyOS documentation versioning policy.

Examples include:

* spelling;
* formatting;
* broken internal references;
* wording improvements that do not alter requirements.

The distinction between editorial and normative change must remain clear.

---

## Release Closure

After successful release, the EPIC should be formally closed.

Closure should confirm:

```text
[ ] Framework released
[ ] Validation complete
[ ] Repository clean
[ ] Tag published
[ ] Metadata updated
[ ] Changelog updated
[ ] Revision history updated
[ ] Remaining non-blocking work transferred to roadmap
```

Unfinished future capabilities should be tracked as roadmap items rather than leaving the EPIC indefinitely incomplete.

---

## Deferred Implementation

EPIC-REL-001 defines the Release Framework architecture and governance.

Not every advanced capability must already be fully automated before framework release.

For example, the roadmap may defer:

* progressive delivery automation;
* automated rollback;
* policy-as-code;
* predictive risk analysis;
* release intelligence.

Framework release means these capabilities are defined sufficiently to guide future implementation.

It does not require every roadmap stage to be complete.

---

## Release Framework Baseline

The released framework becomes the baseline for future FamilyOS release engineering work.

Future changes should be evaluated relative to this baseline.

The baseline provides:

* terminology;
* normative principles;
* lifecycle structure;
* compliance expectations;
* risk model;
* recovery model;
* observability model;
* metrics model.

This prevents release engineering from evolving through disconnected local conventions.

---

## Relationship With Future EPICs

Future EPICs may implement capabilities defined by the Release Framework.

Examples may include:

* release automation;
* deployment orchestration;
* artifact promotion;
* release CLI support;
* progressive delivery;
* release intelligence.

Such EPICs should reference EPIC-REL-001 rather than redefine release governance independently.

---

## Relationship With Build Framework

The Build Framework creates trusted artifacts.

The released Release Framework governs how those artifacts progress toward production.

```text
Build Framework
      |
      v
Trusted Artifact
      |
      v
Release Framework
      |
      v
Controlled Release
```

Both frameworks together establish reproducible delivery.

---

## Relationship With Testing Framework

Testing produces release confidence evidence.

The Release Framework consumes that evidence during readiness and gate evaluation.

The release of EPIC-REL-001 formalizes this integration.

---

## Relationship With Quality Framework

Quality defines expectations and quality gates.

The Release Framework determines how those outcomes participate in production authorization.

---

## Relationship With Plugin Compliance Framework

Plugin compliance determines whether plugins satisfy platform compliance requirements.

The Release Framework determines whether a specific compliant plugin release is authorized for release.

This separation must remain explicit.

---

## Relationship With Documentation Framework

The Documentation Framework governs how the Release Framework itself is structured, maintained, versioned, and evolved as engineering documentation.

EPIC-REL-001 must therefore remain compliant with canonical FamilyOS documentation standards.

---

## Release Governance

The release of EPIC-REL-001 is governed by the same principles it introduces:

* explicit identity;
* evidence;
* validation;
* approval;
* traceability;
* immutable release state;
* controlled evolution.

This provides a practical demonstration that the framework can govern itself.

---

## Release Checklist

Before final publication:

```text
[ ] Canonical document inventory verified
[ ] No required empty files
[ ] No duplicate numbered documents
[ ] Filenames validated
[ ] Headings validated
[ ] Terminology reviewed
[ ] Cross-document consistency reviewed
[ ] Framework integrations reviewed
[ ] Final validation PASS
[ ] Blocking findings = 0
[ ] EPIC metadata synchronized
[ ] MANIFEST synchronized
[ ] CHANGELOG updated
[ ] VALIDATION updated
[ ] Revision History updated
[ ] Release version confirmed
[ ] Git status reviewed
[ ] Final commit created
[ ] Working tree clean
[ ] Annotated tag created
[ ] Tag target verified
[ ] Branch pushed
[ ] Tag pushed
[ ] Remote state verified
```

All mandatory items must be satisfied before formal closure.

---

## Final Release Verification

After publication:

```text
[ ] Release commit exists remotely
[ ] Release tag exists remotely
[ ] Tag points to release commit
[ ] Local repository is clean
[ ] Framework metadata shows final status
[ ] Validation status remains PASS
[ ] No accidental release-time files remain
```

This completes the release procedure.

---

## Release Outcomes

Successful release of EPIC-REL-001 must establish:

* an official Release Framework baseline;
* a canonical release lifecycle;
* controlled versioning;
* release readiness governance;
* release gates;
* artifact promotion principles;
* rollback and recovery requirements;
* release observability;
* release compliance;
* release metrics;
* release risk management;
* a roadmap toward increasingly automated release engineering.

These outcomes become part of the permanent FamilyOS engineering platform.

---

## Strategic Impact

The Release Framework closes a critical gap between engineering work and controlled production change.

With Build, Testing, Quality, Plugin Compliance, and Release foundations in place, FamilyOS gains a coherent engineering chain:

```text
Engineering Change
       |
       v
Build
       |
       v
Testing
       |
       v
Quality
       |
       v
Compliance
       |
       v
Release
       |
       v
Deployment
       |
       v
Observation
       |
       v
Recovery / Improvement
```

This transforms release activity from an isolated operational event into a governed engineering capability.

---

## Final Release Principle

EPIC-REL-001 must conclude by applying its own philosophy.

The framework must not simply declare itself complete.

Its completeness must be demonstrable through structure, validation, repository identity, versioning, and immutable publication.

The final principle is:

> The FamilyOS Release Framework becomes official only when one validated and traceable repository state is intentionally accepted, versioned, tagged, published, and established as the normative baseline for future FamilyOS releases.

The release of EPIC-REL-001 therefore marks the transition from defining how FamilyOS should release software to having an official engineering foundation capable of governing that process.
