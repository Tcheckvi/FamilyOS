# Release Framework

## 22 Release Compliance

### Overview

Release compliance is the capability to ensure that every FamilyOS release satisfies the policies, controls, standards, evidence requirements, governance rules, and approval conditions that apply to its lifecycle.

A release must not be considered compliant merely because it was technically successful.

Technical deployment success and release compliance are different concepts.

A release may deploy correctly and still violate:

* governance requirements;
* approval rules;
* security controls;
* documentation requirements;
* artifact integrity requirements;
* testing expectations;
* quality gates;
* change management policies;
* traceability requirements;
* evidence retention requirements.

The FamilyOS Release Framework therefore treats compliance as an integrated release capability rather than as a post-release administrative activity.

The governing principle is:

> Every FamilyOS release must be demonstrably compliant with the controls that govern its scope, risk, environment, and impact.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of release compliance is to establish a consistent and verifiable model for determining whether a FamilyOS release satisfies all applicable release requirements.

The framework defines expectations for:

* compliance scope;
* release policy enforcement;
* control mapping;
* evidence generation;
* approval traceability;
* artifact compliance;
* change traceability;
* security compliance;
* testing compliance;
* quality compliance;
* documentation compliance;
* deployment compliance;
* rollback preparedness;
* observability compliance;
* exception handling;
* auditability;
* retention;
* compliance reporting;
* continuous improvement.

Release compliance transforms governance requirements into measurable release conditions.

---

## Release Compliance Principle

Compliance must be embedded throughout the release lifecycle.

It must not be postponed until after deployment.

The preferred model is:

```text
Requirements
     |
     v
Release Planning
     |
     v
Control Mapping
     |
     v
Evidence Collection
     |
     v
Validation
     |
     v
Approval
     |
     v
Deployment
     |
     v
Post-Release Evidence
     |
     v
Compliance Confirmation
```

This ensures that compliance is built into the release rather than reconstructed afterward.

---

## Compliance Objectives

Release compliance must support several objectives.

### Conformance

Releases must satisfy applicable FamilyOS policies and standards.

### Evidence

Compliance claims must be supported by evidence.

### Traceability

Every significant decision and control result must be traceable.

### Accountability

Release responsibilities and approval authorities must be identifiable.

### Consistency

Equivalent releases should be evaluated through equivalent compliance rules.

### Automation

Machine-verifiable requirements should be automated where practical.

### Auditability

Historical release decisions and evidence must remain reviewable.

### Risk Control

Exceptions and deviations must be explicitly evaluated and accepted.

---

## Compliance Scope

Release compliance applies to all significant FamilyOS release activities.

This includes:

* release candidates;
* production releases;
* emergency releases;
* hotfixes;
* rollback releases;
* plugin releases;
* platform releases;
* dependency updates;
* configuration releases;
* schema migrations;
* infrastructure changes associated with releases.

The depth of compliance controls may vary according to release risk.

However, no production release is exempt from basic traceability and governance requirements.

---

## Risk-Based Compliance

Compliance controls should be proportional to release risk.

A low-risk documentation-only release does not require the same operational controls as a production schema migration.

The Release Framework should therefore support risk-based control profiles.

Example:

```text
LOW
MEDIUM
HIGH
CRITICAL
```

Each risk level may determine:

* required approvals;
* required testing;
* required evidence;
* security review depth;
* rollback requirements;
* observability requirements;
* stabilization expectations;
* compliance review depth.

Risk classification must be recorded.

---

## Compliance Profile

Every significant release should be evaluated against a defined compliance profile.

A compliance profile may include:

```text
release_type
risk_level
target_environment
required_controls
required_evidence
required_approvals
required_gates
required_retention
```

Profiles prevent arbitrary compliance interpretation between releases.

---

## Control Categories

Release compliance is organized across several control categories.

The primary categories are:

```text
Governance
Traceability
Build
Testing
Quality
Security
Documentation
Artifact Integrity
Deployment
Rollback and Recovery
Observability
Approval
Evidence
Retention
```

These categories establish the minimum compliance model for the Release Framework.

---

## Governance Compliance

Every release must operate within the approved FamilyOS governance model.

Governance compliance should verify:

* release ownership;
* decision authority;
* approval authority;
* escalation paths;
* exception authority;
* responsibility boundaries.

The release record must identify the responsible release owner.

Anonymous or unowned production releases are not acceptable.

---

## Release Ownership

Each significant release must identify an accountable owner.

The owner is responsible for ensuring that release requirements are satisfied or appropriately delegated.

The release record should include:

```text
release_owner
technical_owner
approval_authority
deployment_authority
```

Roles may be held by the same person in smaller environments.

The requirement is clarity, not unnecessary organizational complexity.

---

## Traceability Compliance

Every release must be traceable to the changes it contains.

Traceability should connect:

```text
Requirement
   |
   v
Change
   |
   v
Source Revision
   |
   v
Build
   |
   v
Artifact
   |
   v
Release
   |
   v
Deployment
```

Where applicable, traceability may also include:

* issue identifiers;
* RFCs;
* ADRs;
* pull requests;
* test results;
* quality assessments;
* security findings;
* approval records.

A release must not contain unidentified or unexplained changes.

---

## Source Revision Compliance

The exact source revision used to build a release must be identifiable.

Required metadata may include:

```text
repository
branch
commit_sha
tag
build_id
```

Production releases must not depend on ambiguous source states.

For example:

```text
latest
current
local-build
unknown
```

are insufficient release identifiers.

---

## Build Compliance

Release artifacts must originate from the approved FamilyOS Build Framework.

Build compliance should verify:

* reproducibility expectations;
* approved toolchain;
* dependency locking;
* artifact generation;
* artifact identity;
* artifact integrity;
* provenance;
* build validation.

A release must not substitute unverified local artifacts for approved release artifacts.

---

## Artifact Integrity Compliance

Artifacts must remain identifiable and verifiable throughout the release lifecycle.

Integrity controls may include:

* checksums;
* cryptographic signatures;
* provenance records;
* immutable storage;
* artifact digests;
* trusted registries.

The artifact promoted to production must correspond to the artifact that passed release validation.

The model is:

```text
Build Artifact
      |
      v
Validate
      |
      v
Approve
      |
      v
Promote
      |
      v
Deploy Same Artifact
```

Rebuilding between approval and production deployment should be avoided.

---

## Testing Compliance

Testing compliance confirms that required testing has been completed.

Depending on release scope, evidence may include:

* unit test results;
* integration test results;
* functional test results;
* system test results;
* regression test results;
* contract test results;
* migration tests;
* performance tests;
* recovery tests;
* security tests.

The required testing profile must be determined before release approval.

---

## Test Evidence

Test compliance claims must be evidence-based.

Evidence should include appropriate metadata such as:

```text
test_suite
test_run_id
source_revision
artifact_id
timestamp
result
```

A release should not rely solely on statements such as:

```text
tests passed
```

without sufficient traceability to the tested release state.

---

## Quality Compliance

The Release Framework integrates with the FamilyOS Quality Framework.

Quality compliance may verify:

* mandatory quality gates;
* unresolved defects;
* code quality results;
* reliability expectations;
* performance expectations;
* maintainability requirements;
* release readiness status.

Critical unresolved quality findings must either block the release or require explicit risk acceptance.

---

## Quality Gate Compliance

Release quality gates should expose explicit results.

For example:

```text
unit_tests = PASS
integration_tests = PASS
static_analysis = PASS
security_validation = PASS
release_readiness = PASS
```

Ambiguous states must not be treated as successful.

Examples of ambiguous states include:

```text
UNKNOWN
NOT_RUN
PARTIAL
UNAVAILABLE
```

These states require explicit handling.

---

## Security Compliance

Security is a mandatory release compliance domain.

Security compliance may verify:

* dependency vulnerability status;
* secret scanning;
* artifact integrity;
* access control;
* deployment authorization;
* security testing;
* policy compliance;
* security exception status.

Critical security findings should block production release unless a formally authorized exception exists.

---

## Security Exception Governance

Security exceptions require explicit documentation.

An exception should include:

```text
exception_id
affected_control
risk_description
risk_owner
approval_authority
expiration
mitigation
```

Permanent undocumented security exceptions are not acceptable.

Exceptions must be reviewed before expiration.

---

## Dependency Compliance

Release dependencies must comply with applicable dependency management rules.

Controls may include:

* approved dependency sources;
* locked versions;
* license compatibility;
* vulnerability status;
* integrity verification;
* support status.

A release must not introduce unknown or unapproved dependencies into production.

---

## Documentation Compliance

Release documentation must satisfy applicable FamilyOS documentation requirements.

Depending on release significance, required documentation may include:

* release notes;
* changelog;
* migration documentation;
* deployment instructions;
* rollback procedure;
* known issues;
* operational notes;
* compatibility notes;
* user-facing changes.

Documentation must reflect the actual release.

Documentation describing a different artifact or source state is not valid release evidence.

---

## Release Notes Compliance

Release notes should identify significant changes accurately.

They should include, where relevant:

* added capabilities;
* changed behavior;
* fixed defects;
* removed functionality;
* known limitations;
* compatibility considerations;
* migrations;
* security implications.

Release notes should not conceal material changes.

---

## Version Compliance

Release versions must comply with the FamilyOS versioning policy.

Controls may verify:

* version format;
* uniqueness;
* semantic consistency;
* tag consistency;
* artifact version consistency;
* documentation version consistency.

A release version must identify one unique release state.

---

## Tag Compliance

Production release tags must be immutable after publication.

The tag should identify the source revision corresponding to the release.

A release process must prevent silent reassignment of an existing production tag.

---

## Deployment Compliance

Deployment must follow approved release procedures.

Deployment compliance may verify:

* authorized environment;
* approved release artifact;
* deployment identity;
* deployment authority;
* environment protection;
* deployment logging;
* deployment result;
* post-deployment verification.

Manual deployment is not automatically non-compliant.

However, manual actions must remain controlled and traceable.

---

## Environment Compliance

Release controls may differ between environments.

Typical environments include:

```text
development
testing
staging
production
```

Production environments require the strongest controls.

The target environment must always be explicit.

A release must not accidentally inherit lower-environment compliance rules when targeting production.

---

## Configuration Compliance

Configuration changes must be governed as release changes when they materially affect runtime behavior.

Configuration compliance may verify:

* versioned configuration;
* approved change;
* environment scope;
* secret handling;
* configuration validation;
* rollback capability.

Sensitive configuration values must not appear in release evidence.

Only safe identifiers or references should be retained.

---

## Migration Compliance

Significant migrations require explicit compliance controls.

Migration compliance may verify:

* migration identifier;
* validation status;
* backup readiness;
* compatibility;
* rollback classification;
* recovery strategy;
* approval;
* execution evidence.

Irreversible migrations require stronger controls.

---

## Rollback Compliance

Production releases must satisfy applicable rollback and recovery requirements.

Controls may verify:

```text
previous_stable_release_known == true
rollback_classification_defined == true
required_artifacts_available == true
recovery_plan_present == true
verification_plan_present == true
```

A release with no known recovery path represents a significant compliance risk.

---

## Observability Compliance

A release must provide sufficient observability for its risk level.

Observability compliance may verify:

* release identity visibility;
* deployment markers;
* health checks;
* critical metrics;
* logs;
* alerts;
* recovery visibility.

Critical releases should not proceed when required observability is unavailable.

---

## Approval Compliance

Release approvals must be explicit and traceable.

Approvals should identify:

```text
approver
approval_scope
approval_time
release_id
decision
```

Approval of one release must not automatically authorize a different release.

If the release artifact changes materially after approval, revalidation may be required.

---

## Separation of Duties

Where appropriate, FamilyOS may apply separation of duties.

For high-risk releases, the person who creates the change may not be sufficient as the only production approval authority.

Possible separation includes:

```text
Developer
    |
    v
Reviewer
    |
    v
Release Approver
    |
    v
Deployment Authority
```

The exact model depends on organizational scale and risk.

The principle is independent oversight where justified.

---

## Evidence Model

Compliance depends on evidence.

Each compliance control should identify its supporting evidence.

An evidence record may include:

```text
evidence_id
control_id
release_id
source
result
timestamp
artifact_reference
owner
```

Evidence should be:

* relevant;
* attributable;
* immutable where required;
* timestamped;
* accessible;
* retained according to policy.

---

## Evidence Sources

Compliance evidence may originate from:

* CI systems;
* test systems;
* build systems;
* artifact repositories;
* security scanners;
* deployment systems;
* observability platforms;
* approval systems;
* source control;
* release documentation.

Evidence should preferably be generated automatically when possible.

---

## Compliance Matrix

A release compliance matrix provides a structured view of applicable controls.

Example:

```text
+----------------------+----------+----------+
| Control              | Required | Result   |
+----------------------+----------+----------+
| Build Validation     | Yes      | PASS     |
| Unit Testing         | Yes      | PASS     |
| Integration Testing  | Yes      | PASS     |
| Security Validation  | Yes      | PASS     |
| Release Notes        | Yes      | PASS     |
| Rollback Plan        | Yes      | PASS     |
| Observability        | Yes      | PASS     |
| Approval             | Yes      | PASS     |
+----------------------+----------+----------+
```

The matrix should be generated from authoritative evidence whenever practical.

---

## Compliance Status

Release compliance should expose an explicit status.

Recommended states include:

```text
COMPLIANT
COMPLIANT_WITH_EXCEPTIONS
NON_COMPLIANT
PENDING
```

### COMPLIANT

All mandatory controls are satisfied.

### COMPLIANT_WITH_EXCEPTIONS

Mandatory controls have approved exceptions.

### NON_COMPLIANT

One or more required controls are not satisfied and no valid exception exists.

### PENDING

Required evidence or approval is incomplete.

A production release should normally require either:

```text
COMPLIANT
```

or an explicitly approved:

```text
COMPLIANT_WITH_EXCEPTIONS
```

state.

---

## Compliance Gates

Compliance should participate directly in release gates.

Example:

```text
required_controls_passed == true
required_evidence_available == true
required_approvals_complete == true
critical_exceptions == none
compliance_status in [COMPLIANT, COMPLIANT_WITH_EXCEPTIONS]
```

Automated gates should evaluate deterministic controls.

Human review remains appropriate for risk-based or contextual decisions.

---

## Fail-Closed Behavior

Critical compliance gates should fail closed.

If a required control cannot be evaluated because evidence is unavailable, the default result should not be PASS.

For example:

```text
security_scan = unavailable
```

must not become:

```text
security_scan = pass
```

Unavailable evidence should produce:

```text
PENDING
```

or:

```text
BLOCKED
```

depending on the release policy.

---

## Exception Management

Not every deviation requires permanent release blocking.

The framework supports controlled exceptions.

An exception must be:

* explicit;
* justified;
* risk assessed;
* approved;
* time bounded where appropriate;
* traceable;
* reviewable.

An exception is not equivalent to ignoring a failed control.

---

## Exception Record

An exception record should include:

```text
exception_id
release_id
control_id
reason
risk
mitigation
owner
approver
created_at
expires_at
status
```

Exceptions should be minimized.

Repeated exceptions against the same control indicate a systemic problem that requires correction.

---

## Emergency Release Compliance

Emergency releases require accelerated processes, not uncontrolled processes.

Emergency compliance must preserve minimum mandatory controls.

At minimum, an emergency release should retain:

* release identity;
* source traceability;
* artifact identity;
* critical validation;
* approval;
* deployment logging;
* rollback strategy;
* post-release verification;
* incident reference.

Controls may be deferred only through explicit emergency governance.

---

## Hotfix Compliance

Hotfixes must remain part of normal release history.

A hotfix must identify:

* affected release;
* issue being corrected;
* source change;
* validation performed;
* resulting version;
* deployment evidence.

Hotfixes must not become undocumented production-only changes.

---

## Plugin Release Compliance

FamilyOS plugin releases are subject to both release controls and Plugin Compliance Framework requirements.

Plugin release compliance may verify:

* plugin identity;
* plugin version;
* manifest validity;
* capability declarations;
* contribution declarations;
* dependency compatibility;
* platform compatibility;
* testing;
* security;
* plugin compliance status.

A plugin must not bypass platform release governance merely because it is independently packaged.

---

## Platform Compatibility Compliance

Plugin and component releases must verify compatibility with supported FamilyOS platform versions.

Evidence may include:

```text
minimum_platform_version
maximum_supported_version
compatibility_test_result
```

Unsupported compatibility combinations must not be promoted as compliant.

---

## Compliance Reporting

Each significant release should produce a compliance summary.

The summary may include:

```text
Release
Version
Risk Level
Compliance Profile
Controls Evaluated
Controls Passed
Controls Failed
Approved Exceptions
Outstanding Actions
Final Compliance Status
Approval Authority
```

The report should be concise enough for decision-making while linking to detailed evidence.

---

## Audit Trail

Release compliance must preserve an audit trail.

The trail should make it possible to determine:

* who initiated the release;
* what changed;
* what artifact was used;
* what validation occurred;
* who approved;
* when deployment occurred;
* what exceptions existed;
* whether the release succeeded;
* whether rollback occurred.

Auditability must be designed into the process.

It should not rely on reconstructing fragmented information after an incident.

---

## Evidence Retention

Compliance evidence must be retained according to approved FamilyOS policies.

Retention requirements may vary according to:

* release type;
* environment;
* regulatory requirements;
* security requirements;
* organizational policy.

Evidence required for audit or investigation must not be deleted prematurely.

---

## Evidence Immutability

Certain release evidence should be immutable or protected against unauthorized modification.

Examples may include:

* production release records;
* approval decisions;
* artifact digests;
* release tags;
* security scan results;
* deployment records.

Integrity protections must match the importance of the evidence.

---

## Compliance Automation

Compliance automation should reduce manual effort and increase consistency.

Automatable controls include:

* version validation;
* artifact integrity;
* test completion;
* static analysis;
* security scanning;
* release note presence;
* rollback plan presence;
* observability readiness;
* approval state.

Automation should produce explicit machine-readable results.

---

## Policy as Code

Where practical, release compliance rules may be implemented as policy as code.

Example conceptual rules:

```text
deny release if critical_tests_failed
deny release if artifact_unverified
deny release if security_gate_failed
deny release if approval_missing
deny release if production_rollback_plan_missing
```

Policy as code improves consistency and auditability.

However, policy definitions themselves must be governed and reviewed.

---

## Compliance Drift

Release controls may become outdated as the platform evolves.

Compliance rules must therefore be reviewed periodically.

Drift may occur when:

* architecture changes;
* deployment methods change;
* new threats emerge;
* testing capabilities improve;
* plugin architecture evolves;
* regulatory requirements change.

Compliance must evolve with the platform.

---

## Compliance Metrics

Useful release compliance metrics include:

* percentage of compliant releases;
* percentage of releases with exceptions;
* failed compliance gates;
* repeated exception frequency;
* missing evidence frequency;
* approval delay;
* compliance automation coverage;
* emergency release frequency;
* post-release compliance failures.

Metrics should support improvement, not encourage superficial compliance behavior.

---

## Compliance Quality

A high number of passing controls does not automatically indicate strong compliance.

Compliance quality depends on whether the controls meaningfully address risk.

The framework must avoid:

* redundant controls;
* meaningless approvals;
* evidence collected only for appearance;
* controls that never influence decisions.

Every mandatory control should have a clear purpose.

---

## Relationship With Plugin Compliance Framework

The Plugin Compliance Framework governs structural and behavioral compliance of FamilyOS plugins.

The Release Framework governs whether a particular plugin version is safe and authorized for release.

The relationship is:

```text
Plugin Compliance
       |
       v
Plugin Eligible
       |
       v
Release Compliance
       |
       v
Plugin Release Approved
```

Passing plugin compliance does not automatically authorize production release.

Release-specific controls must still be satisfied.

---

## Relationship With Build Framework

The Build Framework provides evidence for:

* artifact creation;
* dependency resolution;
* integrity;
* reproducibility;
* provenance.

Release compliance consumes this evidence during release evaluation.

---

## Relationship With Testing Framework

The Testing Framework defines how verification is performed.

Release compliance confirms that required verification actually occurred for the release under evaluation.

Testing produces evidence.

Compliance evaluates whether the required evidence is sufficient.

---

## Relationship With Quality Framework

The Quality Framework establishes quality expectations and gates.

Release compliance ensures that required quality controls are satisfied or explicitly excepted before release.

---

## Relationship With Security Framework

Security controls define release security requirements.

Release compliance ensures that those controls are evaluated and their outcomes are traceable.

Security remains an independent authority over security-specific requirements.

---

## Relationship With Release Observability

Release observability provides runtime evidence that supports post-deployment compliance.

Examples include:

* deployment completion;
* health status;
* verification results;
* rollback state;
* stabilization evidence.

Observability therefore extends release compliance beyond pre-deployment approval.

---

## Post-Release Compliance Verification

Some compliance controls can only be confirmed after deployment.

Examples include:

* successful production deployment;
* runtime health verification;
* migration completion;
* stabilization success;
* recovery verification.

The release compliance process should therefore distinguish:

```text
Pre-Release Compliance
```

from:

```text
Post-Release Compliance
```

Final release closure may require both.

---

## Compliance Review

High-risk releases may require a formal compliance review.

The review should confirm:

* applicable controls;
* evidence completeness;
* unresolved findings;
* exceptions;
* approvals;
* operational readiness.

The review must focus on material risk rather than ceremonial process.

---

## Non-Compliance Handling

When a release is non-compliant, the framework must define an explicit response.

Possible responses include:

```text
BLOCK
REMEDIATE
EXCEPTION_REQUEST
DEFER
CANCEL
```

Production deployment must not proceed silently after mandatory compliance failure.

---

## Compliance Failure After Deployment

A release may be discovered to be non-compliant after deployment.

Examples include:

* incorrect artifact;
* missing security evidence;
* unauthorized configuration;
* invalid approval;
* incomplete migration evidence.

The response depends on severity.

Actions may include:

* immediate remediation;
* release suspension;
* rollback;
* incident escalation;
* formal exception;
* evidence correction.

A compliance issue must not automatically trigger rollback when rollback creates greater operational risk.

Risk must be assessed.

---

## Continuous Improvement

Release compliance must improve based on evidence.

Inputs include:

* failed releases;
* compliance exceptions;
* audit findings;
* incidents;
* security findings;
* rollback events;
* control failures;
* developer feedback.

Improvements may include:

* stronger automation;
* clearer policies;
* reduced redundant controls;
* improved evidence generation;
* better ownership;
* better risk classification;
* improved documentation.

---

## Anti-Patterns

The following practices are prohibited or strongly discouraged.

### Compliance After Deployment

Attempting to reconstruct required evidence only after production release.

### Approval Without Evidence

Approving a release without sufficient information to evaluate it.

### Checkbox Compliance

Treating control completion as more important than actual risk reduction.

### Manual Evidence Copying

Repeatedly copying results into documents when authoritative systems can provide direct references.

### Silent Exceptions

Ignoring failed controls without explicit risk acceptance.

### Permanent Temporary Exceptions

Allowing time-bounded exceptions to remain active indefinitely.

### Artifact Substitution

Deploying an artifact different from the one that was validated and approved.

### Mutable Release Tags

Changing a published production tag to point to different source code.

### Unknown Production State

Operating production without a clear release identity.

### Emergency Means Uncontrolled

Using urgency as justification for eliminating all governance and evidence requirements.

---

## Required Outcomes

Implementation of this framework section must ensure that:

* every significant release has an applicable compliance profile;
* release controls are explicit;
* required evidence is identifiable;
* release ownership is clear;
* source, build, artifact, release, and deployment states are traceable;
* required tests and quality gates are verified;
* security requirements are enforced;
* documentation requirements are satisfied;
* rollback and observability requirements are evaluated;
* approvals are traceable;
* exceptions are explicitly governed;
* compliance status is unambiguous;
* production releases cannot silently bypass mandatory controls;
* compliance evidence is retained;
* compliance findings drive continuous improvement.

---

## Final Release Compliance Principle

Release compliance is not an administrative layer added after engineering work is complete.

It is the mechanism that demonstrates that the release has been built, tested, reviewed, approved, deployed, observed, and governed according to the standards required by FamilyOS.

The final principle is:

> A FamilyOS release is compliant only when its required controls are satisfied or explicitly accepted, its evidence is traceable, and its production authorization can be demonstrated without relying on undocumented assumptions.

Release compliance therefore provides the final governance bridge between engineering confidence and authorized production change.
