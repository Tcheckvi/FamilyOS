#### Release Principles

Defined the fundamental FamilyOS release principles, including:

* build is not release;
* release identity must be explicit;
* readiness must be evidence-based;
* validation must remain candidate-bound;
* published identities must remain immutable;
* release authority must be explicit;
* publication must be verified;
* partial failure must remain observable;
* recovery must be designed before failure;
* automation must implement policy rather than redefine it;
* historical release state must remain reconstructable.

---

#### Release Architecture

Defined the architectural boundaries of FamilyOS release engineering.

Established relationships among:

```text
Source
  ↓
Build
  ↓
Release Candidate
  ↓
Validation
  ↓

  ↓
Official Release
  ↓
Publication
  ↓
Distribution
```

Defined separation between:

* build and release;
* validation and approval;
* publication and distribution;

CANDIDATE
   ↓
VALIDATED
   ↓
APPROVED
   ↓
RELEASED
   ↓
PUBLISHED
   ↓

Official Release
```

* stateful execution;
* modular operations;
* idempotency;
* safe retry;
* dry runs;
* preflight validation;
* evidence generation;

Established the principle:

> Automation executes release policy; it does not define release policy.

Defined a future Release Orchestrator architecture without making it mandatory for the initial framework release.

---

```text
PROPOSED
   ↓
DRAFT
   ↓
VALIDATED
   ↓
APPROVED
   ↓
RELEASED
   ↓
ACTIVE
   ↓

```

Established framework self-application and bootstrap principles.

---

#### Roadmap

* policy-as-code;
* automated publication;
* structured evidence storage;
* release signing;
* SBOM generation;

Future capabilities are explicitly separated from current mandatory implementation.

---

#### References

* FamilyOS Engineering Constitution;
* FamilyOS architecture foundations;
* EPIC-ENG-001 — Engineering Foundation;
* EPIC-TST-001 — Testing Framework;
* EPIC-QLT-001 — Quality Framework;
* EPIC-DOC-001 — Documentation Framework;
* EPIC-BLD-001 — Build Framework;
* EPIC-PLUGIN-002 — Plugin Compliance Framework;
* applicable ADRs;
* applicable RFCs;
* FamilyOS specifications;
* Git;
* semantic versioning concepts;
* software supply-chain standards.

External standards remain advisory unless explicitly adopted through FamilyOS governance.

---

#### Framework Validation

Defined the final validation model for EPIC-REL-001.

Validation covers:

* canonical structure;
* completeness;
* semantic consistency;
* cross-references;
* control documents;
* version consistency;
* repository state;
* release readiness.

Blocking findings allowed for final closure:

```text
0
```

---

#### Implementation Checklist

Added a comprehensive final implementation checklist.

The checklist explicitly distinguishes:

```text
framework definition
```

from:

```text
current implementation
```

and:

```text
future roadmap capability
```

This allows the foundational framework to be released with disciplined manual release execution without falsely claiming implementation of future orchestration, signing, SBOM, or provenance infrastructure.

---

### Changed

#### Canonical Structure Migration

Replaced the inherited generic Engineering Foundation-style numbered structure with a dedicated Release Framework architecture.

The previous structure included:

```text
00-EPIC.md
01-Context.md
01-Introduction.md
02-Vision.md
03-Engineering-Principles.md
04-Repository-Architecture.md
05-Development-Workflow.md
06-Coding-Standards.md
07-Project-Structure.md
08-Toolchain.md
09-Environment-Management.md
10-Dependency-Management.md
11-Configuration-Management.md
12-Build-Philosophy.md
13-Testing-Philosophy.md
14-Documentation-Philosophy.md
15-Quality-Philosophy.md
16-Technical-Governance.md
17-Engineering-Lifecycle.md
18-Roadmap.md
19-References.md
20-Validation.md
21-Summary.md
22-Release.md
23-Implementation-Checklist.md
```

The inherited structure contained duplicate numbering at `01` and did not represent the actual architectural concerns of a Release Framework.

It has been replaced by the canonical release-specific `00–31` structure.

---

#### Release Discipline

Formalized existing FamilyOS release practices around:

* repository cleanliness;
* final commits;
* version selection;
* annotated tags;
* branch publication;
* tag publication;
* authoritative remote verification.

These practices are now part of a reusable Release Framework rather than isolated manual procedures.

---

#### Framework Integration

Expanded Release Framework integration with:

* Build Framework;
* Testing Framework;
* Quality Framework;
* Documentation Framework;
* Plugin Compliance Framework;
* Security Architecture;
* Observability Architecture;
* FamilyOS governance.

---

#### Implementation Maturity

Clarified that the initial framework operates at:

```text
manual-governed
```

maturity.

The initial framework requires:

```text
framework documentation
manual validation
controlled Git release workflow
annotated tagging
remote publication verification
```

while advanced automation remains roadmap work.

---

### Removed

* Removed the duplicate canonical `01` numbering model.
* Removed generic Engineering Foundation-derived documents from the active canonical Release Framework sequence.
* Removed reliance on successful build completion as sufficient evidence of release completion.
* Removed reliance on local tag existence as sufficient evidence of publication.
* Removed reliance on successful push commands without remote verification.
* Removed implicit assumptions that repository permissions automatically grant release authority.
* Removed ambiguity between publication and distribution.
* Removed ambiguity between release validation and governance approval.

---

### Security

* Added explicit release credential protection.
* Prohibited release credentials from repository content.
* Added least-privilege requirements.
* Added trusted publication identity requirements.
* Added protected CI/CD publication requirements.
* Added candidate integrity requirements.
* Added tag integrity requirements.
* Added artifact integrity architecture.
* Added provenance security architecture.
* Added dependency and supply-chain security considerations.
* Added release withdrawal and security incident response concepts.
* Added future signing, SBOM, and signed provenance maturity paths.

---

## Release Preparation

The intended release identity for this framework milestone is:

```text
Version:
4.8.0

Tag:
v4.8.0-release-framework

Type:
framework

Channel:
stable
```

These values remain release intent until final repository validation and publication are completed.

---

## Final Closure Requirements

Before version `4.8.0` can be considered officially released, the following must be verified:

```text
Canonical Structure       PASS
Document Completeness     PASS
Control Documents         PASS
Semantic Validation       PASS
Cross-References          PASS
Implementation Checklist  PASS
Release Validation        PASS
Final Version             VERIFIED
Final Commit              VERIFIED
Official Tag              VERIFIED
Branch Publication        VERIFIED
Tag Publication           VERIFIED
Remote State              VERIFIED
Working Tree              CLEAN
```

---

## Repository Integrity Target

At final closure, the expected repository relationship is:

```text
HEAD
=
origin/feature/foundation-engineering-docs
=
v4.8.0-release-framework
```

All three must resolve to the final Release Framework release commit.

---

## Publication Rule

The presence of this changelog entry does not itself prove that version `4.8.0` has been released.

The release becomes authoritative only after:

```text
final validation
      ↓
final release commit
      ↓
annotated tag creation
      ↓
branch publication
      ↓
tag publication
      ↓
remote verification
      ↓
clean final repository state
```

---

## Final Statement

Version **4.8.0** establishes the first canonical **FamilyOS Release Framework**.

It transforms release engineering from a collection of repository operations into a governed platform capability covering release planning, readiness, candidate identity, versioning, artifacts, provenance, validation, automation, CI/CD, repository state, tagging, publishing, distribution, security, observability, governance, compliance, metrics, risk management, and recovery.

EPIC-REL-001 version `4.8.0` is completed and historically published under the immutable tag `v4.8.0-release-framework`.
