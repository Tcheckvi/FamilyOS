## 1. Purpose

This document records validation requirements, execution evidence, and revalidation state for:

**EPIC-REL-001 — Release Framework**

It is the authoritative evidence record for determining whether the current canonical Release Framework representation remains:

* structurally complete;
* machine-readable;
* internally consistent;
* semantically coherent;
* aligned with the physical repository;
* aligned with its canonical manifest;
* consistent with historical publication evidence;
* supported by successful repository quality gates;
* suitable for continued use as the canonical FamilyOS Release Framework.

This document distinguishes between:

1. historical publication;
2. current repository state;
3. post-release normalization;
4. current validation evidence;
5. final revalidation outcome.

Only evidence from actual execution SHALL be used to convert pending validation requirements into PASS results.

---

## 2. Historical Publication

EPIC-REL-001 version `4.8.0` was historically published under:

```text
v4.8.0-release-framework
```

Historical publication commit:

```text
306338d7ca3df2c1d4d9b74247a837aa01deb637
```

Historical release state:

```text
EPIC:                EPIC-REL-001
Framework:           Release Framework
Framework Version:   4.8.0
Historical Tag:      v4.8.0-release-framework
Publication Status:  Published
```

The historical tag represents an immutable repository state.

Current normalization SHALL NOT move, recreate, overwrite, reinterpret, or otherwise mutate the historical release tag.

---

## 3. Historical Tag Evidence

The historical tag has already been observed in the repository.

Annotated tag:

```text
v4.8.0-release-framework
```

Annotated tag object:

```text
6173105841167426c17ec08486980abb56e7085b
```

Dereferenced tag target:

```text
306338d7ca3df2c1d4d9b74247a837aa01deb637
```

The dereferenced historical target identifies the original framework publication commit.

Result from the historical audit:

```text
Historical Tag Exists: PASS
Historical Publication Commit Identified: PASS
Remote Historical Tag Observed: PASS
```

Current post-release validation SHALL later confirm that this historical reference remains unchanged after normalization.

---

## 4. Validation Authority

Validation responsibilities are distributed as follows:

| Document                         | Responsibility                                                     |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `12-Release-Validation.md`       | Defines validation of individual release candidates.               |
| `28-Validation.md`               | Defines normative validation of the Release Framework itself.      |
| `30-Release.md`                  | Defines framework publication and release-completion requirements. |
| `31-Implementation-Checklist.md` | Defines implementation and adoption activities.                    |
| `EPIC.yaml`                      | Defines machine-readable framework and validation state.           |
| `MANIFEST.md`                    | Defines canonical inventory and structural requirements.           |
| `VALIDATION.md`                  | Records actual framework validation execution and evidence.        |

A requirement appearing elsewhere SHALL NOT automatically be treated as passed.

---

## 5. Revalidation Context

The current activity is:

```text
Post-Release Revalidation
```

The purpose is to verify the current canonical documentation state without rewriting historical publication.

Revalidation includes:

* YAML parsing;
* machine-readable contract validation;
* filesystem inventory;
* numbering integrity;
* control-document integrity;
* empty-file detection;
* manifest synchronization;
* active-state consistency;
* local Markdown reference integrity;
* canonical document references;
* release architecture consistency;
* release lifecycle consistency;
* versioning consistency;
* release readiness consistency;
* release candidate consistency;
* artifact and provenance consistency;
* publication semantics;
* rollback and recovery consistency;
* security boundary consistency;
* observability consistency;
* governance consistency;
* compliance consistency;
* release metrics consistency;
* release risk consistency;
* framework boundary validation;
* placeholder validation;
* accidental join-defect validation;
* Ruff;
* MyPy;
* Pytest;
* Git diff validation;
* historical tag integrity;
* remote publication verification;
* final repository cleanliness.

---

## 6. Canonical Inventory Baseline

The canonical structure is:

```text
32 numbered documents
+
7 control documents
=
39 canonical files
```

Canonical numbered range:

```text
00 → 31
```

Expected machine-readable structure:

```yaml
structure:
  numbered_documents: 32
  canonical_document_range: "00-31"
  control_documents: 7
  canonical_files: 39
```

---

## 7. Numbered Document Baseline

The canonical numbered documents are:

```text
00-EPIC.md
01-Context.md
02-Vision.md
03-Release-Principles.md
04-Release-Architecture.md
05-Release-Lifecycle.md
06-Versioning-Strategy.md
07-Release-Types-and-Channels.md
08-Release-Planning.md
09-Release-Readiness.md
10-Release-Candidates.md
11-Artifacts-and-Provenance.md
12-Release-Validation.md
13-Release-Automation.md
14-CI-CD-Integration.md
15-Changelog-and-Release-Notes.md
16-Tagging-and-Repository-State.md
17-Publishing-and-Distribution.md
18-Rollback-and-Recovery.md
19-Release-Security.md
20-Release-Observability.md
21-Release-Governance.md
22-Release-Compliance.md
23-Release-Metrics.md
24-Release-Risk-Management.md
25-Framework-Lifecycle.md
26-Roadmap.md
27-References.md
28-Validation.md
29-Summary.md
30-Release.md
31-Implementation-Checklist.md
```

Expected result:

```text
Numbered Documents: 32
First:                00-EPIC.md
Last:                 31-Implementation-Checklist.md
Missing Numbers:      0
Duplicate Numbers:    0
```

---

## 8. Control Document Baseline

The canonical control documents are:

```text
EPIC-REL-001.md
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

Expected result:

```text
Control Documents: 7
Missing:           0
Unexpected:        0
```

---

## 9. Filesystem Baseline

The expected canonical filesystem contract is:

```text
Declared Files:   39
Filesystem Files: 39
Numbered Files:   32
Control Files:     7
Missing Files:     []
Unexpected Files:  []
```

The initial read-only audit observed:

```text
all files: 39
numbered: 32
first numbered: 00-EPIC.md
last numbered: 31-Implementation-Checklist.md
control files: 7
missing controls: []
unexpected controls: []
```

This provides structural evidence for the repository state at the time of the audit.

The final filesystem contract SHALL be re-executed after control-document normalization.

---

## 10. Validation State Model

Revalidation uses the following states:

```text
PENDING
PASS
FAIL
NOT APPLICABLE
```

Meaning:

| State            | Meaning                                                                         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PENDING`        | Sufficient evidence for the current repository state has not yet been recorded. |
| `PASS`           | Actual validation evidence confirms that the requirement is satisfied.          |
| `FAIL`           | Actual evidence confirms that the requirement is not satisfied.                 |
| `NOT APPLICABLE` | The requirement does not apply and the exclusion is justified.                  |

Historical success SHALL NOT automatically become current PASS evidence.

---

## 11. Machine-Readable Revalidation State

During post-release revalidation, `EPIC.yaml` SHALL represent:

```yaml
baseline:
  framework_version: 4.8.0
  documentation_status: completed
  repository_validation_status: pending_revalidation
  final_validation_status: pending_revalidation
```

Historical release state SHALL remain:

```yaml
release:
  historical_tag: v4.8.0-release-framework
  historical_commit: 306338d7ca3df2c1d4d9b74247a837aa01deb637
  publication_status: published
  historical_tag_immutable: true
  remote_publication_verified: true
```

This distinction preserves the difference between:

```text
Historical Publication
        ≠
Current Revalidation
```

---

## 12. YAML Parse Validation

`EPIC.yaml` SHALL be parsed using an actual YAML parser.

Validation SHALL confirm:

* exactly one YAML document;
* valid YAML syntax;
* expected top-level structure;
* no Markdown fences;
* no malformed list markers;
* no duplicate-document construction;
* canonical machine-readable values.

Current result:

```text
YAML Parse: PENDING
```

---

## 13. YAML Contract Validation

The expected contract is:

```text
id: EPIC-REL-001
title: Release Framework
version: 4.8.0
status: completed
deliverables: 39
deliverable_count: 39
```

Expected structure:

```text
numbered_documents: 32
canonical_document_range: 00-31
control_documents: 7
canonical_files: 39
```

Expected publication identity:

```text
historical_tag:
v4.8.0-release-framework

historical_commit:
306338d7ca3df2c1d4d9b74247a837aa01deb637
```

Current result:

```text
YAML Contract: PENDING
```

---

## 14. Filesystem Contract Validation

Validation SHALL compare:

```text
EPIC.yaml deliverables
        ↓
physical filesystem
```

Required relationship:

```text
declared == actual
```

Expected result:

```text
declared:   39
actual:     39
missing:    []
unexpected: []
```

Current result:

```text
Filesystem Contract: PENDING
```

---

## 15. Numbering Validation

Validation SHALL confirm:

```text
00 → 31
```

with exactly:

```text
32 numbered documents
```

Current result:

```text
Numbering Validation: PENDING
```

---

## 16. Control Document Validation

Validation SHALL confirm all seven control documents exist and contain substantive content.

Current result:

```text
Control Document Validation: PENDING
```

---

## 17. Empty File Validation

No required canonical file may be empty.

Expected:

```text
Empty Required Files: 0
```

Current result:

```text
Empty File Validation: PENDING
```

---

## 18. Manifest Synchronization

`MANIFEST.md` SHALL match:

* `EPIC.yaml`;
* physical filesystem;
* canonical numbering;
* canonical control-document list;
* framework version;
* historical publication identity.

Expected structural markers:

```text
32 numbered documents
7 control documents
39 canonical files
00 → 31
```

Current result:

```text
Manifest Synchronization: PENDING
```

---

## 19. README Synchronization

`README.md` SHALL:

* identify EPIC-REL-001 correctly;
* describe the completed Release Framework;
* provide valid navigation;
* use canonical document names;
* avoid obsolete active-state claims;
* preserve historical context accurately.

Current result:

```text
README Synchronization: PENDING
```

---

## 20. EPIC Summary Synchronization

`EPIC-REL-001.md` SHALL align with:

```text
EPIC.yaml
00-EPIC.md
MANIFEST.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
CHANGELOG.md
```

The initial audit identified stale active claims including:

```text
Final validation evidence pending.
Final release commit pending.
Official annotated release tag pending.
Authoritative remote publication verification pending.
```

These statements conflict with historical Git evidence and SHALL be normalized.

Current result:

```text
EPIC Summary Synchronization: PENDING
```

---

## 21. CHANGELOG Synchronization

`CHANGELOG.md` SHALL preserve historical progression while accurately distinguishing historical pre-release state from current active state.

The initial audit identified stale active statements including:

```text
Final control-document alignment remains pending.
Framework lifecycle status remains in-progress.
```

and:

```text
EPIC-REL-001 remains in-progress
```

where presented as current authoritative state.

Current result:

```text
CHANGELOG Synchronization: PENDING
```

---

## 22. Revision History Synchronization

`Revision-History.md` SHALL record:

* framework evolution;
* version `4.8.0`;
* historical publication;
* historical tag;
* publication commit;
* post-release normalization;
* current revalidation.

Current result:

```text
Revision History Synchronization: PENDING
```

---

## 23. State Consistency

The active canonical state SHALL converge on:

```text
EPIC:                   EPIC-REL-001
Framework:              Release Framework
Framework Version:      4.8.0
Framework Status:       Completed

Historical Publication: Published
Historical Tag:         v4.8.0-release-framework
Historical Commit:      306338d7ca3df2c1d4d9b74247a837aa01deb637
Historical Tag Policy:  Immutable
```

During revalidation:

```text
Repository Validation: Validated
Final Revalidation:     Validated
```

After successful current evidence:

```text
Repository Validation: Validated
Final Revalidation:     Validated
```

Current result:

```text
State Consistency: PENDING
```

---

## 24. Historical State Handling

Terms such as:

```text
planned
prepared
pending
in-progress
candidate
published
completed
```

may appear legitimately when describing lifecycle concepts or historical transitions.

Validation SHALL distinguish:

```text
historical / normative lifecycle terminology
```

from:

```text
current authoritative framework state
```

Only contradictory active-state claims SHALL be treated as defects.

---

## 25. Local Markdown Reference Validation

Local Markdown references SHALL resolve to existing canonical files.

Validation SHOULD detect:

* missing referenced Markdown files;
* stale canonical filenames;
* obsolete paths;
* broken local navigation;
* legacy renamed documents.

Expected:

```text
Broken Local References: 0
```

Current result:

```text
Reference Integrity: PENDING
```

---

## 26. Canonical Document Reference Validation

References to canonical Release Framework documents SHOULD correspond to actual files.

Examples include:

```text
04-Release-Architecture.md
05-Release-Lifecycle.md
06-Versioning-Strategy.md
09-Release-Readiness.md
10-Release-Candidates.md
11-Artifacts-and-Provenance.md
12-Release-Validation.md
16-Tagging-and-Repository-State.md
17-Publishing-and-Distribution.md
18-Rollback-and-Recovery.md
21-Release-Governance.md
28-Validation.md
30-Release.md
```

Current result:

```text
Canonical Document References: PENDING
```

---

## 27. Release Architecture Consistency

The Release Framework architecture SHALL remain coherent across:

```text
03-Release-Principles.md
04-Release-Architecture.md
05-Release-Lifecycle.md
06-Versioning-Strategy.md
07-Release-Types-and-Channels.md
08-Release-Planning.md
09-Release-Readiness.md
10-Release-Candidates.md
11-Artifacts-and-Provenance.md
12-Release-Validation.md
13-Release-Automation.md
14-CI-CD-Integration.md
16-Tagging-and-Repository-State.md
17-Publishing-and-Distribution.md
18-Rollback-and-Recovery.md
19-Release-Security.md
20-Release-Observability.md
21-Release-Governance.md
22-Release-Compliance.md
23-Release-Metrics.md
24-Release-Risk-Management.md
```

Current result:

```text
Release Architecture Consistency: PENDING
```

---

## 28. Release Lifecycle Consistency

The canonical lifecycle SHOULD remain conceptually aligned around:

```text
Planning
    ↓
Readiness
    ↓
Candidate Creation
    ↓
Validation
    ↓
Approval
    ↓
Official Release Identity
    ↓
Publication
    ↓
Verification
    ↓
Completion
```

Failure and recovery MAY create alternate transitions.

Current result:

```text
Release Lifecycle Consistency: PENDING
```

---

## 29. Versioning Consistency

Versioning semantics SHALL remain consistent across:

```text
06-Versioning-Strategy.md
07-Release-Types-and-Channels.md
08-Release-Planning.md
10-Release-Candidates.md
15-Changelog-and-Release-Notes.md
16-Tagging-and-Repository-State.md
30-Release.md
```

The framework's own historical version is:

```text
4.8.0
```

Current result:

```text
Versioning Consistency: PENDING
```

---

## 30. Release Readiness Consistency

Release readiness SHALL remain distinct from:

* candidate creation;
* approval;
* publication;
* completion.

Readiness means applicable preconditions have been satisfied sufficiently to progress to the next governed release state.

Current result:

```text
Release Readiness Consistency: PENDING
```

---

## 31. Release Candidate Consistency

A Release Candidate SHALL represent a sufficiently stable release identity suitable for qualification and approval.

The exact object validated SHALL remain traceable to the object considered for publication.

Current result:

```text
Release Candidate Consistency: PENDING
```

---

## 32. Artifact and Provenance Consistency

Release artifacts SHALL preserve:

* identity;
* version;
* integrity;
* provenance;
* checksums where applicable;
* candidate association;
* publication traceability.

Validated artifacts SHOULD NOT be silently rebuilt into different unvalidated artifacts during publication.

Current result:

```text
Artifact and Provenance Consistency: PENDING
```

---

## 33. Publication Semantics

Publication SHALL remain a controlled state transition rather than a single command.

The framework distinguishes:

```text
attempted publication
        ≠
verified publication
```

and:

```text
publication
        ≠
distribution
```

Current result:

```text
Publication Semantic Consistency: PENDING
```

---

## 34. Historical Publication Verification

For the framework's own publication, the following evidence has already been observed:

```text
Tag:
v4.8.0-release-framework

Historical Commit:
306338d7ca3df2c1d4d9b74247a837aa01deb637

Remote Dereferenced Tag:
306338d7ca3df2c1d4d9b74247a837aa01deb637
```

Historical publication evidence:

```text
Historical Publication Exists: PASS
Historical Remote Tag Observed: PASS
```

Final revalidation SHALL verify that this relationship remains unchanged after the normalization commit.

---

## 35. Rollback and Recovery Consistency

The framework SHALL preserve clear semantics for:

* pre-publication failure;
* partial publication;
* failed publication;
* withdrawal;
* rollback;
* restoration;
* recovery;
* re-publication where permitted.

Current result:

```text
Rollback and Recovery Consistency: PENDING
```

---

## 36. Security Consistency

Release security SHALL remain coherent regarding:

* publication authority;
* protected credentials;
* artifact integrity;
* provenance;
* trusted execution environments;
* repository protection;
* release authorization;
* stable publication permissions.

Current result:

```text
Release Security Consistency: PENDING
```

---

## 37. Observability Consistency

Release observability SHALL provide sufficient state to understand:

* release progress;
* candidate identity;
* validation outcome;
* publication state;
* partial publication;
* failures;
* recovery;
* final completion.

Current result:

```text
Release Observability Consistency: PENDING
```

---

## 38. Governance Consistency

Governance SHALL remain coherent across:

```text
21-Release-Governance.md
22-Release-Compliance.md
24-Release-Risk-Management.md
28-Validation.md
30-Release.md
31-Implementation-Checklist.md
EPIC-REL-001.md
EPIC.yaml
VALIDATION.md
```

Validation SHALL review:

* authority;
* ownership;
* approval;
* publication authority;
* exception handling;
* escalation;
* risk acceptance;
* closure authority.

Current result:

```text
Governance Consistency: PENDING
```

---

## 39. Framework Boundary Validation

The Release Framework SHALL preserve explicit boundaries with:

```text
EPIC-ENG-001
EPIC-TST-001
EPIC-QLT-001
EPIC-BLD-001
EPIC-SEC-001
EPIC-OPS-001
EPIC-PLUGIN-002
```

Release consumes build, testing, quality, security, and operational evidence without replacing those frameworks.

Current result:

```text
Framework Boundary Validation: PENDING
```

---

## 40. Placeholder Validation

Validation SHALL distinguish actual unresolved placeholders from explanatory text.

Potential marker examples include:

```text
TODO
TBD
FIXME
PLACEHOLDER
XXX
TO BE DEFINED
TO BE COMPLETED
```

Current result:

```text
Unresolved Blocking Placeholders: PENDING
```

---

## 41. Join Defect Validation

Documentation normalization SHALL check for malformed accidental word joins.

Observed examples from the initial audit include patterns such as:

```text
beforestable
canonicaldocument
mustbe
releasepublication
actualcandidate
grantrelease
publicationtargets
recoveryis
```

The actual search set MAY be expanded according to observed defects.

Current result:

```text
Join Defect Validation: PENDING
```

---

## 42. Ruff Validation

Canonical command:

```text
ruff check .
```

Expected result:

```text
All checks passed!
```

Current result:

```text
Ruff: PENDING
```

Only actual execution SHALL convert this to PASS.

---

## 43. MyPy Validation

Canonical command:

```text
mypy src
```

The actual checked source-file count SHALL be recorded from execution.

Current result:

```text
MyPy: PENDING
```

---

## 44. Pytest Validation

Canonical command:

```text
pytest -q
```

The actual test count and execution time SHALL be recorded from current execution.

Current result:

```text
Pytest: PENDING
```

---

## 45. Repository Diff Validation

Canonical command:

```text
git diff --check
```

Current result:

```text
DiffCheck: PENDING
```

---

## 46. Historical Tag Integrity

The historical tag is:

```text
v4.8.0-release-framework
```

Historical commit:

```text
306338d7ca3df2c1d4d9b74247a837aa01deb637
```

Final revalidation SHALL confirm:

```text
local historical commit
=
remote dereferenced historical commit
=
306338d7ca3df2c1d4d9b74247a837aa01deb637
```

Current result:

```text
Historical Tag Integrity: PENDING FINAL RECHECK
```

---

## 47. Remote Branch Verification

After a post-release normalization commit is created and pushed, validation SHALL compare:

```text
local HEAD
```

with:

```text
origin/feature/foundation-engineering-docs
```

Expected:

```text
local HEAD == remote branch HEAD
```

Current result:

```text
Remote Branch Verification: PENDING
```

---

## 48. Final Repository Cleanliness

After correction commit and remote synchronization, the repository SHOULD report:

```text
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

Current result:

```text
Final Repository Cleanliness: PENDING
```

## 50. Historical Evidence Matrix

Historical publication evidence already observed during the read-only audit:

| Historical Evidence                                                         | Result |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Annotated tag exists                                                        | PASS   |
| Tag name is `v4.8.0-release-framework`                                      | PASS   |
| Tag dereferences to historical publication commit                           | PASS   |
| Historical publication commit is `306338d7ca3df2c1d4d9b74247a837aa01deb637` | PASS   |
| Remote tag is observable                                                    | PASS   |
| Remote dereferenced target matches historical commit                        | PASS   |

These results describe historical publication evidence.

They do not automatically validate the current normalized repository state.

## 51. Final Revalidation Conditions

EPIC-REL-001 MAY transition to final validated state only when:

* `EPIC.yaml` parses successfully;
* machine-readable contract passes;
* canonical inventory passes;
* numbering passes;
* all control documents are present;
* no required canonical file is empty;
* manifest synchronization passes;
* active state consistency passes;
* reference integrity passes;
* release architecture review passes;
* release lifecycle review passes;
* versioning review passes;
* readiness semantics pass;
* candidate semantics pass;
* artifact/provenance semantics pass;
* publication semantics pass;
* recovery semantics pass;
* security semantics pass;
* observability semantics pass;
* governance review passes;
* framework boundaries pass;
* placeholders pass;
* join-defect review passes;
* Ruff passes;
* MyPy passes;
* Pytest passes;
* Git diff validation passes;
* historical tag integrity is re-confirmed;
* post-release correction commit is created;
* correction commit is pushed;
* remote branch matches local HEAD;
* historical remote tag remains unchanged;
* final working tree is clean.

---

## 52. Final Machine-Readable State

After successful revalidation, the expected `EPIC.yaml` state is:

```yaml
baseline:
  framework_version: 4.8.0
  documentation_status: completed
  repository_validation_status: validated
  final_validation_status: validated
```

Historical release metadata remains:

```yaml
release:
  historical_tag: v4.8.0-release-framework
  historical_commit: 306338d7ca3df2c1d4d9b74247a837aa01deb637
  publication_status: published
  historical_tag_immutable: true
  remote_publication_verified: true
```

---

## 53. Closure State

The framework is historically completed and published.

The current revalidation SHALL NOT reopen its historical release lifecycle.

Instead:

```text
Historical Framework State:
Completed / Published

Current Documentation Activity:
Post-Release Revalidation
```

After current validation succeeds:

```text
Repository Revalidation: Validated
Final Revalidation:      Validated
```

---

## 54. Post-Release Correction Procedure

The expected workflow is:

```text
Normalize control documents
        ↓
Validate EPIC.yaml
        ↓
Validate canonical inventory
        ↓
Validate numbering
        ↓
Validate references
        ↓
Validate active state
        ↓
Validate semantic consistency
        ↓
Execute Ruff
        ↓
Execute MyPy
        ↓
Execute Pytest
        ↓
Execute git diff --check
        ↓
Verify historical tag
        ↓
Record actual evidence
        ↓
Set validated state
        ↓
Stage corrected control documents
        ↓
Validate staged state
        ↓
Create correction commit
        ↓
Re-run quality gates
        ↓
Push branch
        ↓
Verify remote branch
        ↓
Verify historical tag unchanged
        ↓
Confirm clean working tree
```

---

## 55. Evidence Recording Rule

The required validation model is:

```text
Execute
    ↓
Observe
    ↓
Evaluate
    ↓
Record
```

The following model is prohibited:

```text
Requirement exists
    ↓
Assume success
    ↓
Record PASS
```

This rule applies to both automated and manual framework validation.

---

## 56. Current Validation Decision

Historical framework state:

```text
EPIC:                   EPIC-REL-001
Framework:              Release Framework
Framework Version:      4.8.0
Framework Status:       Completed

Historical Publication: Published
Historical Tag:         v4.8.0-release-framework
Historical Commit:      306338d7ca3df2c1d4d9b74247a837aa01deb637
```

Current revalidation state:

```text
Repository Validation: Validated
Final Revalidation:     Validated
```

Therefore:

```text
EPIC-REL-001 REVALIDATION: PASS
```

This PASS result confirms that the current normalized documentation state has completed evidence-based repository revalidation.

Historical publication remains immutable and independently verified.

---

## 57. Final Validation Principle

The Release Framework itself SHALL follow the release principles it defines.

Historical publication proves that a release event occurred.

Current repository evidence determines whether the current canonical representation is validated.

Therefore:

> Historical publication must remain immutable, while current canonical documentation must earn its validation state through evidence from the repository state being evaluated.
