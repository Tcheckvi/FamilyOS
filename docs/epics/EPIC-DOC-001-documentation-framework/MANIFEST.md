## 1. Purpose

This manifest defines the canonical repository inventory for:

```text
docs/epics/EPIC-DOC-001-documentation-framework
```

It establishes the authoritative structural contract for EPIC-DOC-001.

The manifest is responsible for defining:

* canonical numbered documents;
* canonical control documents;
* expected file counts;
* canonical numbering;
* historical structural context;
* normalization decisions;
* removed duplicate skeleton documents;
* repository inventory expectations;
* filesystem validation requirements;
* manifest synchronization requirements.

The manifest SHALL remain aligned with:

```text
EPIC.yaml
README.md
EPIC-DOC-001.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
CHANGELOG.md
```

---

## 2. Canonical Repository Contract

The normalized EPIC-DOC-001 repository contract is:

```text
Canonical numbered range: 00-23
Numbered documents:       24
Control documents:         7
Canonical files:          31
Duplicate number groups:   0
Empty canonical files:     0
```

The canonical repository SHALL contain exactly the files declared by this manifest.

---

## 3. Canonical Directory

```text
docs/
└── epics/
    └── EPIC-DOC-001-documentation-framework/
```

No alternative directory is authoritative for EPIC-DOC-001.

---

## 4. Canonical Inventory

The canonical inventory consists of:

```text
24 numbered documents
+
7 control documents
=
31 canonical files
```

---

## 5. Canonical Numbered Documents

The numbered documentation set SHALL contain exactly the following files:

```text
00-EPIC.md
01-Introduction.md
02-Documentation-Vision.md
03-Documentation-Architecture.md
04-Documentation-Standards.md
05-Documentation-Lifecycle.md
06-Documentation-Templates.md
07-Documentation-Metadata.md
08-Documentation-Versioning.md
09-Documentation-Lifecycle.md
10-Documentation-Governance.md
11-Documentation-Templates.md
12-Documentation-Automation.md
13-Documentation-Quality-Gates.md
14-Documentation-Repository-Organization.md
15-Documentation-Review-Process.md
16-Documentation-Maintenance.md
17-Documentation-Migration-Strategy.md
18-Documentation-Deprecation-Policy.md
19-Documentation-Metrics.md
20-Documentation-Framework-Validation.md
21-Documentation-Framework-Summary.md
22-Documentation-Framework-Release.md
23-Documentation-Framework-Implementation-Checklist.md
```

---

## 6. Numbering Contract

The canonical numbering sequence is:

```text
00
01
02
03
04
05
06
07
08
09
10
11
12
13
14
15
16
17
18
19
20
21
22
23
```

Every number SHALL occur exactly once.

Therefore:

```text
Expected numbered documents: 24
Expected duplicate groups:    0
Expected missing numbers:      0
```

01-Introduction.md
02-Documentation-Vision.md
03-Documentation-Architecture.md
04-Documentation-Standards.md
05-Documentation-Lifecycle.md
06-Documentation-Templates.md
07-Documentation-Metadata.md
08-Documentation-Versioning.md
09-Documentation-Lifecycle.md
10-Documentation-Governance.md
11-Documentation-Templates.md
12-Documentation-Automation.md

EPIC-DOC-001.md
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

---

## 11. Canonical File Count

The expected filesystem equation is:

```text
24 numbered documents
+ 7 control documents
---------------------
31 canonical files
```

Therefore:

```text
expected_canonical_files = 31
```

---

## 12. Historical Structural State

Before normalization, repository inspection identified a mixed structure containing:

```text
33 numbered files
7 control documents
40 total files
```

The structure nominally covered numbers `01-23`, but contained duplicate numbering across `09-18`.

---

## 13. Historical Duplicate Number Groups

The historical duplicate groups were:

```text
09:
  09-Documentation-Lifecycle.md
  09-Documentation-Validation.md

10:
  10-Documentation-Automation.md
  10-Documentation-Governance.md

11:
  11-Documentation-Generation.md
  11-Documentation-Templates.md

12:
  12-Documentation-Automation.md
  12-Documentation-Publishing.md

13:
  13-Documentation-Quality-Gates.md
  13-Documentation-Traceability.md

14:
  14-Documentation-Quality.md
  14-Documentation-Repository-Organization.md

15:
  15-Documentation-Governance.md
  15-Documentation-Review-Process.md

16:
  16-Documentation-Maintenance.md
  16-Documentation-Toolchain.md

17:
  17-Documentation-Migration-Strategy.md
  17-Roadmap.md

18:
  18-Documentation-Deprecation-Policy.md
  18-References.md
```

Historical duplicate groups:

```text
10
```

---

## 14. Duplicate Skeleton Classification

Repository inspection classified the following files as short generic skeleton documents rather than substantive framework documents:

```text
09-Documentation-Validation.md
10-Documentation-Automation.md
11-Documentation-Generation.md
12-Documentation-Publishing.md
13-Documentation-Traceability.md
14-Documentation-Quality.md
15-Documentation-Governance.md
16-Documentation-Toolchain.md
17-Roadmap.md
18-References.md
```

These documents contained generic framework scaffolding and competed with more substantive documents using the same numeric identifiers.

---

## 15. Removed Duplicate Skeleton Documents

The normalized canonical structure excludes:

```text
09-Documentation-Validation.md
10-Documentation-Automation.md
11-Documentation-Generation.md
12-Documentation-Publishing.md
13-Documentation-Traceability.md
14-Documentation-Quality.md
15-Documentation-Governance.md
16-Documentation-Toolchain.md
17-Roadmap.md
18-References.md
```

Expected canonical presence:

```text
false
```

for each of these paths.

---

## 16. Retained Documents from Duplicate Groups

The following substantive documents remain canonical:

```text
09-Documentation-Lifecycle.md
10-Documentation-Governance.md
11-Documentation-Templates.md
12-Documentation-Automation.md
13-Documentation-Quality-Gates.md
14-Documentation-Repository-Organization.md
15-Documentation-Review-Process.md
16-Documentation-Maintenance.md
17-Documentation-Migration-Strategy.md
18-Documentation-Deprecation-Policy.md
```

---

## 17. Introduction of `00-EPIC.md`

The historical numbered structure began at `01`.

Normalization introduces:

```text
00-EPIC.md
```

as the canonical numbered framework entry point.

This aligns EPIC-DOC-001 with the normalized FamilyOS engineering-framework documentation model.

---

## 18. Structural Transformation

The normalization can be represented as:

```text
Historical Structure
33 numbered documents
7 control documents
40 files
10 duplicate number groups
        │
        │ remove 10 duplicate skeletons
        ▼
23 numbered documents
7 control documents
30 files
        │
        │ add canonical 00-EPIC.md
        ▼
Canonical Structure
24 numbered documents
7 control documents
31 files
0 duplicate number groups
```

---

## 19. Structural Preservation Rule

Normalization SHALL preserve substantive framework semantics.

The purpose of structural normalization is not to redesign the Documentation Framework.

It is to:

* eliminate numbering ambiguity;
* establish deterministic navigation;
* align repository metadata;
* restore canonical inventory integrity;
* enable reliable validation.

---

## 20. Historical Evidence Preservation

Historical repository evidence SHALL remain preserved.

Normalization SHALL NOT rewrite historical Git identity.

If an earlier release tag exists, normalization SHALL NOT:

* move the tag;
* delete and recreate the tag;
* assign the tag to the normalization commit;
* falsely claim normalized control state existed at the historical release commit.

---

## 21. Framework Version

The normalized framework continues to declare:

```text
1.0.0
```

Structural normalization alone does not automatically require a framework semantic-version change.

A future framework release MAY introduce a new version when justified by substantive framework evolution.

---

## 22. Current Framework Status

Current declared framework status:

```text
baseline
```

The baseline status reflects the existing framework metadata.

It SHALL NOT be changed solely to make repository validation appear complete.

Framework lifecycle state and repository validation state are separate concerns.

---

## 23. Current Repository Validation State

Until current evidence has been executed and recorded:

```text
Repository Validation: Validated
Final Revalidation:    Validated
```

Historical release declarations do not substitute for current repository evidence.

---

## 24. Historical Release Declaration

The numbered release document:

```text
22-Documentation-Framework-Release.md
```

declares a Documentation Framework release with:

```text
Version: 1.0.0
Status: released
Date: 2026-08-06
```

This constitutes documentary release evidence.

It does not independently establish the authoritative Git tag or commit.

---

## 25. Historical Git Verification

Before historical release fields are finalized, validation SHALL determine:

```text
historical_tag
historical_commit
remote_publication_verified
```

using repository evidence.

No tag name or commit hash SHALL be invented.

---

## 26. Filesystem Contract

Validation SHALL compare this manifest against the actual filesystem.

Conceptually:

```text
declared = set(manifest_files)
actual = set(filesystem_files)

missing = declared - actual
unexpected = actual - declared
```

Required result:

```text
missing: []
unexpected: []
```

---

## 27. Numbering Integrity Contract

For every canonical numbered file:

```text
NN-*.md
```

the numeric prefix SHALL occur exactly once.

Required result:

```text
duplicate groups: 0
```

The expected numeric set is:

```text
00-23
```

---

## 28. Empty File Contract

Canonical files SHALL NOT be empty.

Required result:

```text
empty canonical files: 0
```

---

## 29. Removed File Contract

The following paths SHALL NOT exist in the normalized canonical filesystem:

```text
09-Documentation-Validation.md
10-Documentation-Automation.md
11-Documentation-Generation.md
12-Documentation-Publishing.md
13-Documentation-Traceability.md
14-Documentation-Quality.md
15-Documentation-Governance.md
16-Documentation-Toolchain.md
17-Roadmap.md
18-References.md
```

---

## 30. Manifest Synchronization

This manifest SHALL remain synchronized with `EPIC.yaml`.

At minimum, the following values SHALL agree:

```text
numbered_documents: 24
canonical_document_range: 00-23
control_documents: 7
canonical_files: 31
```

The deliverable set in `EPIC.yaml` SHALL equal the canonical inventory defined here.

---

## 31. README Synchronization

`README.md` SHALL describe the same canonical structure.

The README SHALL NOT advertise removed duplicate skeleton documents as canonical files.

Historical discussion MAY reference them explicitly as removed or superseded structural artifacts.

---

## 32. EPIC Synchronization

`00-EPIC.md` and `EPIC-DOC-001.md` SHALL describe the normalized repository structure consistently.

Neither document SHALL claim duplicate-number structures are still canonical.

---

## 33. CHANGELOG Synchronization

`CHANGELOG.md` SHALL record the structural normalization.

The normalization record SHOULD include:

* duplicate-number discovery;
* duplicate skeleton classification;
* removal of ten duplicate skeleton documents;
* introduction of `00-EPIC.md`;
* canonical range normalization to `00-23`;
* manifest alignment;
* control-document revalidation.

---

## 34. Revision History Synchronization

`Revision-History.md` SHALL preserve the distinction between:

```text
historical framework release
```

and:

```text
post-release repository normalization
```

These events SHALL NOT be conflated.

---

## 35. Validation Synchronization

`VALIDATION.md` SHALL provide current evidence for the manifest contract.

The validation SHALL verify:

* inventory;
* numbering;
* duplicates;
* empty files;
* YAML parsing;
* YAML/filesystem alignment;
* removed-file absence;
* control-document consistency;
* historical release evidence;
* quality gates;
* final repository state.

---

## 36. Reference Integrity

Canonical documents SHOULD reference existing canonical files.

References to removed skeleton documents SHALL be classified as either:

```text
historical
```

or:

```text
stale
```

Historical references MAY remain where required to explain repository evolution.

Stale canonical references SHALL be corrected.

---

## 37. Placeholder Integrity

Canonical control documents SHALL NOT contain unresolved implementation placeholders presented as current requirements.

Examples include:

```text
TODO
TBD
FIXME
XXX
TO BE DEFINED
TO BE COMPLETED
```

Occurrences inside:

* validation rules;
* examples;
* historical records;
* literal pattern descriptions;

MAY be valid when clearly contextualized.

Validation SHALL distinguish documented examples from unresolved placeholders.

---

## 38. Semantic Integrity

Structural validation alone is insufficient.

Control documents SHALL also agree semantically on:

* framework identity;
* version;
* status;
* canonical structure;
* validation state;
* release state;
* historical evidence;
* closure state.

---

## 39. Framework Boundary Integrity

EPIC-DOC-001 owns documentation-framework semantics.

It SHALL NOT redefine authoritative semantics belonging to:

```text
EPIC-ENG-001
EPIC-TST-001
EPIC-QLT-001
EPIC-BLD-001
EPIC-REL-001
EPIC-OBS-001
EPIC-SEC-001
EPIC-OPS-001
```

Cross-framework references SHOULD identify authority rather than duplicate it.

---

## 40. Repository Quality Gates

Repository revalidation SHALL include the current engineering quality gates:

```text
ruff check .
mypy src
pytest -q
git diff --check
```

Required final result:

```text
Ruff:      0
MyPy:      0
Pytest:    0
DiffCheck: 0
```

Actual test counts and execution times SHALL be recorded as evidence rather than predicted by this manifest.

---

## 41. Manifest Validation Matrix

| Validation Area                 | Requirement |
| ------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Canonical directory             | Required    |
| Numbered range                  | `00-23`     |
| Numbered documents              | 24          |
| Control documents               | 7           |
| Canonical files                 | 31          |
| Duplicate numbers               | 0           |
| Missing numbers                 | 0           |
| Empty files                     | 0           |
| Removed skeletons absent        | Required    |
| YAML parse                      | Required    |
| YAML/filesystem alignment       | Required    |
| Manifest synchronization        | Required    |
| README synchronization          | Required    |
| Control-document alignment      | Required    |
| Historical release verification | Required    |
| Quality gates                   | Required    |
| Final working tree              | Clean       |

## 43. Expected Inventory Verification

A successful inventory verification SHALL produce logically equivalent evidence to:

```text
declared: 31
actual: 31
missing: []
unexpected: []
```

---

## 44. Expected Numbering Verification

A successful numbering verification SHALL produce:

```text
numbered documents: 24
range: 00-23
duplicate groups: 0
missing numbers: []
```

---

## 45. Expected Removed-File Verification

A successful removed-file check SHALL establish that none of the ten duplicate skeleton documents remains in the canonical filesystem.

Expected result:

```text
removed duplicate skeletons present: []
```

---

## 46. Current Normalization State

At the point represented by this manifest:

```text
Duplicate skeleton cleanup:       Performed
Numbering collisions:             Resolved
Canonical 00-EPIC.md:             Introduced
Target canonical range:           00-23
Target numbered count:            24
Target control count:              7
Target canonical count:           31

Repository Validation:            Validated
Final Revalidation:               Validated
Historical Git State:             Documentary Only
Final Closure:                    Closed
```

These states SHALL only advance when supported by current evidence.

---

## 47. Closure Conditions

The manifest may be considered validated when all of the following are established:

```text
[ ] 24 canonical numbered documents exist
[ ] numbered range is exactly 00-23
[ ] no numbering collisions exist
[ ] no numbered documents are missing
[ ] all seven control documents exist
[ ] canonical file count equals 31
[ ] no canonical file is empty
[ ] all ten duplicate skeleton files are absent
[ ] EPIC.yaml parses successfully
[ ] EPIC.yaml matches filesystem inventory
[ ] README.md matches canonical structure
[ ] EPIC-DOC-001.md matches canonical structure
[ ] CHANGELOG.md records normalization
[ ] Revision-History.md records normalization
[ ] VALIDATION.md contains current evidence
[ ] historical release evidence is verified
[ ] repository quality gates pass
[ ] remote state is verified where required
[ ] final working tree is clean
```

---

## 48. Validation State Transition

The intended state transition is:

```text
Pending Revalidation
        │
        │ execute current repository validation
        ▼
Validated
        │
        │ execute final consistency verification
        ▼
Final Validation Passed
        │
        │ commit and publish normalization
        ▼
Closed
```

State transitions SHALL be evidence-driven.

---

## 49. Historical Integrity Rule

A later normalization commit SHALL NOT redefine the historical release commit.

The repository may therefore legitimately contain:

```text
historical release commit
        │
        ▼
later normalization commit
        │
        ▼
later final repository-state commit
```

This preserves both release history and current canonical structure.

## 50. Manifest Authority

For repository inventory questions concerning EPIC-DOC-001:

```text
MANIFEST.md
```

is the human-readable inventory authority.

For machine-readable repository contract information:

```text
EPIC.yaml
```

is authoritative.

If these documents disagree, the discrepancy SHALL be treated as a validation defect until reconciled against the actual repository and framework history.

## 51. Final Target State

The target normalized state is:

```text
EPIC:                     EPIC-DOC-001
Framework:                Documentation Framework
Framework Version:        1.0.0

Canonical Range:          00-23
Numbered Documents:       24
Control Documents:         7
Canonical Files:          31

Duplicate Number Groups:   0
Missing Numbers:           0
Empty Canonical Files:     0

Repository Validation:    Validated
Final Revalidation:       Validated
Historical Release:       Documentary Only
Final Working Tree:       Clean
```

The final state SHALL only be recorded after the corresponding evidence exists.

## 52. Summary

This manifest defines the normalized canonical repository structure for EPIC-DOC-001.

The normalization resolves the historical mixed structure by:

1. removing ten duplicate generic skeleton documents;
2. retaining the substantive documents from duplicate-number groups;
3. introducing `00-EPIC.md`;
4. establishing a deterministic `00-23` numbered sequence;
5. establishing seven canonical control documents;
6. defining a 31-file canonical repository contract;
7. preserving historical release identity;
8. requiring evidence-based revalidation before final closure.

Canonical inventory:

```text
24 numbered documents
7 control documents
31 canonical files
```

Current repository validation and historical release classification are complete:

```text
Repository Validation: Validated
Final Revalidation:    Validated
```
