# Documentation Framework

## 09 Documentation Lifecycle

### Context

Documentation is a continuously evolving component of the FamilyOS engineering ecosystem.

Unlike temporary notes or informal descriptions, official documentation must follow a controlled lifecycle to ensure:

* consistency,
* quality,
* traceability,
* maintainability,
* long-term availability.

The documentation lifecycle defines how documentation is created, reviewed, approved, maintained, deprecated, and archived.

---

## Documentation Lifecycle Principles

The FamilyOS documentation lifecycle follows these principles:

### Controlled Evolution

Documentation must evolve through explicit lifecycle states.

Every official document must have a known status.

---

### Traceability

Each lifecycle transition must be traceable through:

* Git history,
* pull requests,
* reviews,
* related engineering artifacts.

---

### Quality Before Publication

Documents must not become official before meeting required quality standards.

Validation includes:

* structure verification,
* terminology consistency,
* reference validation,
* technical review.

---

## Documentation Lifecycle States

FamilyOS documentation uses the following lifecycle model:

```text
Draft
  |
  v
Review
  |
  v
Approved
  |
  v
Published
  |
  v
Maintained
  |
  v
Deprecated
  |
  v
Archived
```

---

## Draft State

### Purpose

The Draft state is used during initial creation.

Characteristics:

* incomplete content is allowed,
* concepts may still evolve,
* discussions are ongoing.

Draft documents are not considered official references.

---

### Requirements

Draft documents must include:

* document identifier,
* title,
* purpose,
* initial context,
* ownership information.

Example:

```yaml
status: draft
version: 0.1.0
```

---

## Review State

### Purpose

The Review state validates documentation quality and technical accuracy.

During review:

* contributors verify content,
* architects validate consistency,
* maintainers check compliance.

---

### Review Activities

Review should verify:

* correct terminology,
* appropriate structure,
* relationship with existing documents,
* absence of contradictions,
* completeness of references.

---

### Review Outcome

A document may:

* move to Approved,
* return to Draft,
* require additional changes.

---

## Approved State

### Purpose

The Approved state indicates that the document has passed governance review.

Approved documents represent official FamilyOS knowledge.

---

### Requirements

Approved documents must contain:

* final version,
* approval information,
* related references,
* validation status.

Example:

```yaml
status: approved
version: 1.0.0
```

---

## Published State

### Purpose

Published documentation is available as an official reference.

Published documents may be used by:

* developers,
* plugin contributors,
* maintainers,
* external contributors.

---

### Publication Requirements

Published documentation must have:

* stable location,
* version identifier,
* changelog entry,
* repository history.

---

## Maintained State

### Purpose

Maintained documents are actively updated as FamilyOS evolves.

Typical maintained documents:

* architecture documentation,
* specifications,
* plugin documentation,
* development guidelines.

---

### Maintenance Activities

Maintenance includes:

* corrections,
* improvements,
* compatibility updates,
* new feature documentation.

---

## Deprecated State

### Purpose

Deprecated documentation remains available for historical reasons but should no longer be used as a primary reference.

---

### Deprecation Requirements

Deprecated documents must identify:

* deprecation reason,
* replacement document,
* final version,
* migration guidance.

Example:

```yaml
status: deprecated
replacement: DOCUMENT-ID
```

---

## Archived State

### Purpose

Archived documents preserve historical knowledge.

Archived documents are:

* read-only,
* preserved permanently,
* excluded from active references.

---

### Archive Information

Archived documents must include:

* archive date,
* last version,
* historical purpose.

---

## Lifecycle Transitions

Allowed transitions:

| Current State | Allowed Next State |
| ------------- | ------------------ |
| Draft         | Review             |
| Review        | Draft              |
| Review        | Approved           |
| Approved      | Published          |
| Published     | Maintained         |
| Maintained    | Deprecated         |
| Deprecated    | Archived           |

Invalid transitions require governance approval.

---

## Documentation Ownership

Every official document must have an owner.

Ownership responsibilities:

| Role             | Responsibility                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Author           | Creates content                |
| Reviewer         | Validates quality              |
| Maintainer       | Ensures evolution              |
| Architect        | Validates architectural impact |
| Governance Owner | Approves lifecycle changes     |

---

## Lifecycle Metadata

Official documentation should contain lifecycle metadata.

Example:

```yaml
document:
  status: maintained
  version: 1.2.0
  owner: documentation-team
  created: 2026-08-06
  updated: 2026-08-06
```

---

## Integration With Git Workflow

Documentation lifecycle is integrated with repository management.

Examples:

Draft:

```text
feature/document-update
```

Approved:

```text
pull-request-review
```

Published:

```text
release-tag
```

Archived:

```text
archive-history
```

---

## Integration With Release Management

Documentation lifecycle must align with software releases.

Examples:

* new features require documentation updates,
* breaking changes require lifecycle review,
* releases must include documentation status.

---

## Governance Rules

The following rules apply:

1. Official documents must not bypass lifecycle states.
2. Deprecated documents must not be deleted without approval.
3. Archived documents must remain accessible.
4. Lifecycle changes must be recorded.
5. Ownership must always be identified.

---

## Relationship With Other Frameworks

The documentation lifecycle integrates with:

* Engineering Foundation,
* Quality Framework,
* Release Framework,
* RFC Framework,
* ADR Framework,
* Specification Framework.

---

## Final Compliance

A documentation artifact complies with the FamilyOS lifecycle standard when:

* its lifecycle state is explicit,
* transitions are controlled,
* ownership is defined,
* history is preserved,
* quality validation is performed.

The documentation lifecycle guarantees that FamilyOS knowledge remains reliable throughout the complete evolution of the platform.
