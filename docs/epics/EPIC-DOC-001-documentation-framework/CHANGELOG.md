## 1. Purpose

This changelog records meaningful evolution of:

```text
EPIC-DOC-001 — Documentation Framework
```

It distinguishes between:

* framework semantic evolution;
* repository structural changes;
* historical release declarations;
* post-release normalization;
* validation-state changes;
* future framework revisions.

Repository normalization SHALL NOT silently rewrite historical framework identity.

---

## 2. Current Revision

### Structural Normalization and Revalidation

Current state:

```text
Framework Version:       1.0.0
Framework State:         Baseline
Repository Validation:   Validated
Final Revalidation:      Validated
Historical Release:      Documentary Only
```

The current revision normalizes the historical mixed repository structure while preserving substantive framework content and historical evidence.

---

## 3. Added

### 3.1 Canonical `00-EPIC.md`

Added:

```text
00-EPIC.md
```

as the canonical numbered framework entry point.

The document consolidates:

* framework identity;
* purpose;
* context;
* problem statement;
* objectives;
* scope;
* principles;
* documentation architecture;
* lifecycle;
* governance;
* quality;
* automation;
* validation;
* release semantics;
* acceptance criteria.

This establishes a canonical numbered sequence beginning at `00`.

---

### 3.2 Explicit Canonical Repository Contract

Established the normalized repository contract:

```text
Canonical Range:       00-23
Numbered Documents:    24
Control Documents:      7
Canonical Files:       31
```

---

### 3.3 Explicit Control-Document Contract

Standardized the seven canonical control documents:

```text
EPIC-DOC-001.md
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

---

### 3.4 Machine-Readable Repository Contract

Expanded `EPIC.yaml` to define:

* framework identity;
* framework version;
* lifecycle state;
* objectives;
* deliverables;
* canonical structure;
* historical structure;
* normalization metadata;
* documentation principles;
* documentation domains;
* lifecycle semantics;
* governance requirements;
* quality requirements;
* automation capabilities;
* validation requirements;
* framework boundaries;
* release classification;
* historical evidence;
* acceptance conditions;
* closure state.

---

### 3.5 Canonical Manifest

Expanded `MANIFEST.md` into the authoritative human-readable repository inventory.

The manifest now records:

```text
24 numbered documents
7 control documents
31 canonical files
```

---

### 3.6 Human-Readable Navigation

Expanded `README.md` to document:

* framework purpose;
* architecture;
* canonical numbered structure;
* control documents;
* normalization history;
* duplicate classification;
* navigation;
* framework boundaries;
* validation state.

---

### 3.7 Current Validation Evidence

Current repository evidence confirms:

```text
Canonical Structure:              PASS
Numbering Integrity:              PASS
Removed Skeleton Validation:      PASS
YAML / Filesystem Contract:       PASS
Historical Release Classification: PASS
Ruff:                             PASS
MyPy:                             PASS
Pytest:                           PASS
DiffCheck:                        PASS
```

The current automated test suite result is:

```text
1243 passed
```

---

## 4. Changed

### 4.1 Numbered Structure

The previous repository contained a mixed numbered structure consisting of:

```text
33 numbered files
```

covering nominal numbers:

```text
01-23
```

with duplicate numbering across:

```text
09-18
```

The normalized structure is now:

```text
00-23
```

with exactly one canonical document per numeric prefix.

---

### 4.2 Canonical Numbered Count

Historical observed numbered count:

```text
33
```

Current canonical numbered count:

```text
24
```

---

### 4.3 Canonical Repository Count

Historical observed repository count:

```text
40
```

Current canonical repository count:

```text
31
```

---

### 4.4 Framework Validation State

The repository validation state advanced from:

```text
Pending Revalidation
```

to:

```text
Validated
```

after current structural, semantic, filesystem, historical, and repository quality evidence passed.

---

### 4.5 Final Revalidation State

Final revalidation advanced from:

```text
Pending Revalidation
```

to:

```text
Validated
```

after the current evidence set passed.

---

## 5. Removed

The following ten generic duplicate skeleton documents are removed from the canonical repository:

```text
09-Documentation-Validation.md
10-Documentation-Automation.md
11-Documentation-Generation.md
12-Documentation-Publishing.md
13-Documentation-Traceability.md
14-Documentation-Quality.md
15-Documentation-Governance.md
16-Documentation-Toolchain.md
17-Roadmap.md
18-References.md
```

These files were classified during repository audit as short generic framework skeletons.

They contained repeated structures such as:

```text
Purpose
Objectives
Principles
Responsibilities
Validation
Summary
```

and competed numerically with more substantive framework documents.

---

## 6. Retained

The following substantive documents remain canonical from the duplicate-number range:

```text
09-Documentation-Lifecycle.md
10-Documentation-Governance.md
11-Documentation-Templates.md
12-Documentation-Automation.md
13-Documentation-Quality-Gates.md
14-Documentation-Repository-Organization.md
15-Documentation-Review-Process.md
16-Documentation-Maintenance.md
17-Documentation-Migration-Strategy.md
18-Documentation-Deprecation-Policy.md
```

These documents provide domain-specific framework content rather than generic scaffolding.

40 total files
10 duplicate number groups
01-23 nominal range

        ↓

Remove 10 duplicate skeleton documents

Add 00-EPIC.md

        ↓

Canonical State
---------------
24 numbered documents
7 control documents
31 canonical files
00-23
0 duplicate groups
```

---

## 9. Canonical Numbered Sequence

The normalized canonical sequence is:

```text
00-EPIC.md
01-Introduction.md
02-Documentation-Vision.md
03-Documentation-Architecture.md
04-Documentation-Standards.md
05-Documentation-Lifecycle.md
06-Documentation-Templates.md
07-Documentation-Metadata.md
08-Documentation-Versioning.md
09-Documentation-Lifecycle.md
10-Documentation-Governance.md
11-Documentation-Templates.md
12-Documentation-Automation.md
13-Documentation-Quality-Gates.md
14-Documentation-Repository-Organization.md
15-Documentation-Review-Process.md
16-Documentation-Maintenance.md

20-Documentation-Framework-Validation.md
21-Documentation-Framework-Summary.md
22-Documentation-Framework-Release.md
23-Documentation-Framework-Implementation-Checklist.md
```

---

## 10. Historical Repository Reorganization

Repository history contains:

```text
4775299d0039a26051115a66ce4e7063c303c179
docs(epic-doc-001): reorganize Documentation Framework structure
```

dated:

```text
2026-08-06
```

This historical reorganization introduced substantial framework content but also produced the mixed numbered structure later normalized by the current revision.

The historical commit SHALL remain immutable.

---

## 11. Historical Release Declaration

The numbered release document:

```text
22-Documentation-Framework-Release.md
```

declares:

```text
Documentation Framework
Version: 1.0.0
Status: released
Date: 2026-08-06
```

This is valid documentary evidence of a framework release declaration.

---

## 12. Historical Git Release Investigation

Repository history was inspected for an authoritative dedicated Documentation Framework tag or release commit.

No dedicated Documentation Framework Git tag was found.

Two tags were found in EPIC-DOC-001 repository history:

```text
v3.5.0-documents-plugin
v4.2.0-adr-governance-consolidation
```

Neither represents a Documentation Framework release.

---

## 13. Excluded Tag — `v3.5.0-documents-plugin`

Tag:

```text
v3.5.0-documents-plugin
```

resolves to:

```text
935865417f851f15fc617a56da8d5230c0361f41
```

This tag belongs to the Documents Plugin release and SHALL NOT be treated as the EPIC-DOC-001 Documentation Framework release identity.

---

## 14. Excluded Tag — `v4.2.0-adr-governance-consolidation`

Tag:

```text
v4.2.0-adr-governance-consolidation
```

resolves to:

```text
e4ea9e239c9672c07808aa81432d555f9e84724c
```

This tag belongs to ADR governance consolidation and SHALL NOT be treated as the EPIC-DOC-001 Documentation Framework release identity.

---

## 15. Historical Release Classification

The authoritative historical classification is:

```text
Historical Release: DOCUMENTARY ONLY
```

Therefore:

```text
Dedicated Documentation Framework Tag: None
Dedicated Documentation Release Commit: None
Publication Model: Documentary
Historical Git Release Identity: Not Established
```

No historical tag or release commit SHALL be invented.

---

## 16. Historical Release Preservation

The current normalization SHALL NOT:

* create a fictitious historical release tag;
* attach an unrelated tag to EPIC-DOC-001;
* rewrite historical repository commits;
* claim normalized files existed before they were introduced;
* rewrite the historical release declaration.

Historical truth and current canonical truth SHALL remain distinct.

---

## 17. Framework Version

The Documentation Framework remains:

```text
1.0.0
```

The current revision is primarily structural and repository-governance normalization.

It does not introduce a new framework semantic version.

---

## 18. Framework Lifecycle State

The current canonical framework lifecycle state is:

```text
Baseline
```

This state is distinct from:

```text
Historical Release: Documentary Only
```

and:

```text
Repository Validation: Validated
```

---

## 19. Status Model

EPIC-DOC-001 distinguishes:

```text
Framework Lifecycle State
Historical Release State
Repository Validation State
Final Revalidation State
Repository Closure State
```

These SHALL NOT be conflated.

Current values are:

```text
Framework Lifecycle State: Baseline
Historical Release State:  Documentary Only
Repository Validation:     Validated
Final Revalidation:        Validated
Final Closure:             Closed
```

---

## 20. Validation Evidence

Current structural validation confirms:

```text
Canonical Range:         00-23
Numbered Documents:      24
Control Documents:        7
Canonical Files:         31
Duplicate Number Groups:  0
Missing Numbers:          0
```

---

## 21. YAML Validation

Current `EPIC.yaml`:

* parses successfully;
* declares 31 deliverables;
* matches the 31-file filesystem;
* declares 24 numbered documents;
* declares seven control documents;
* declares canonical range `00-23`;
* preserves documentary-only release semantics.

Result:

```text
YAML / Filesystem Contract: PASS
```

---

## 22. Filesystem Validation

Current canonical filesystem result:

```text
declared: 31
actual:   31
missing:  []
unexpected: []
```

Result:

```text
Filesystem Contract: PASS
```

---

## 23. Numbering Validation

Current numbering result:

```text
Numbered Documents: 24
Range:              00-23
Collisions:         {}
```

Result:

```text
Numbering Integrity: PASS
```

---

## 24. Removed Skeleton Validation

Current result:

```text
removed duplicate skeletons present: []
```

Result:

```text
Removed Skeleton Validation: PASS
```

---

## 25. Historical Integrity Validation

Current machine-readable release contract confirms:

```text
historical_release_model: documentary_only
historical_tag: null
historical_commit: null
publication_status: documentary_release
historical_release_verified: documentary_only
```

Result:

```text
Historical Integrity: PASS
```

---

## 26. Repository Quality Gates

Current repository quality evidence:

```text
Ruff:      0
MyPy:      0
Pytest:    0
DiffCheck: 0
```

Current Pytest result:

```text
1243 passed
```

Therefore:

```text
EPIC-DOC-001 REVALIDATION: PASS
```

---

## 27. Framework Semantics Preserved

The current normalization preserves the framework’s semantic domains:

* documentation architecture;
* standards;
* lifecycle;
* templates;
* metadata;
* versioning;
* governance;
* automation;
* quality gates;
* repository organization;
* review;
* maintenance;
* migration;
* deprecation;
* metrics;
* validation;
* release.

---

## 28. Documentation Principles Preserved

Core principles remain:

```text
Documentation Is an Engineering Artifact
Single Source of Truth
Explicit Ownership
Traceability
Maintainability
Version Control
Validation
Controlled Evolution
```

---

## 29. Architecture Preserved

The framework retains its conceptual layers:

```text
Strategic Documentation
Governance Documentation
Specification Documentation
Implementation Documentation
```

---

## 30. Lifecycle Preserved

The framework retains the controlled lifecycle:

```text
Draft
  ↓
Review
  ↓
Validation
  ↓
Approval
  ↓
Publication
  ↓
Maintenance
  ↓
Revision
  ↓
Deprecation
  ↓
Archival
```

---

## 31. Governance Preserved

Documentation governance continues to cover:

* ownership;
* review;
* approval;
* validation;
* maintenance;
* lifecycle transition;
* migration;
* deprecation;
* exception handling.

---

## 32. Automation Preserved

Documentation automation remains supported for:

* naming validation;
* metadata validation;
* structure validation;
* reference validation;
* inventory validation;
* generation;
* quality gates;
* release validation.

Automation SHALL NOT replace engineering ownership or required review.

---

## 33. Quality Model Preserved

Documentation quality remains concerned with:

* correctness;
* completeness;
* consistency;
* clarity;
* discoverability;
* traceability;
* maintainability;
* structural validity.

---

## 34. Repository Organization Preserved

The framework continues to recognize documentation areas such as:

```text
docs/
├── adr/
├── rfcs/
├── epics/
├── specs/
├── architecture/
├── plugins/
├── guides/
├── reference/
└── templates/
```

---

## 35. Review Model Preserved

Documentation review continues to evaluate:

* technical correctness;
* clarity;
* structure;
* terminology;
* references;
* metadata;
* architectural alignment;
* ownership;
* maintainability.

---

## 36. Maintenance Model Preserved

Published documentation remains subject to maintenance addressing:

* stale content;
* broken references;
* terminology drift;
* structural drift;
* ownership changes;
* implementation changes.

---

## 37. Migration Model Preserved

Documentation migration continues to follow:

```text
Current State
    ↓
Migration Plan
    ↓
Controlled Transformation
    ↓
Validation
    ↓
Reference Update
    ↓
Historical Record
```

---

## 38. Deprecation Model Preserved

Deprecated documentation SHOULD communicate:

* deprecation state;
* reason;
* replacement where available;
* migration path where relevant.

---

## 39. Metrics Preserved

Documentation metrics may continue to evaluate:

* coverage;
* structural compliance;
* metadata compliance;
* broken references;
* review completion;
* stale documentation;
* validation results;
* maintenance activity.

---

## 40. Framework Boundaries Preserved

EPIC-DOC-001 remains authoritative for Documentation Framework semantics.

Related authorities remain:

```text
EPIC-ENG-001    Engineering Foundation
EPIC-TST-001    Testing Framework
EPIC-QLT-001    Quality Framework
EPIC-BLD-001    Build Framework
EPIC-REL-001    Release Framework
EPIC-OBS-001    Observability Framework
EPIC-SEC-001    Security Framework
EPIC-OPS-001    Operations Framework
```

---

## 41. Current Canonical State

```text
EPIC:                     EPIC-DOC-001
Framework:                Documentation Framework
Framework Version:        1.0.0
Framework State:          Baseline

Canonical Range:          00-23
Numbered Documents:       24
Control Documents:         7
Canonical Files:          31

Duplicate Groups:          0

Historical Release:       Documentary Only
Dedicated Framework Tag:  None
Dedicated Release Commit: None

Repository Validation:    Validated
Final Revalidation:       Validated
Validation Result:        PASS

Final Commit Created:     true
Working Tree Clean:       true
EPIC Closed:              true
```

---

## 42. Remaining Closure Work

The following repository closure steps remain after revalidation:

```text
Stage canonical normalization
        ↓
Verify staged contract
        ↓
Create normalization commit
        ↓
Push branch
        ↓
Verify remote branch
        ↓
Normalize final repository-state metadata
        ↓
Create final repository-state commit
        ↓
Push final state
        ↓
Verify clean working tree
        ↓
Close EPIC
```

---

## 43. Current Revision Classification

The current revision is classified as:

```text
Structural Normalization
+
Control-Document Alignment
+
Repository Revalidation
```

It is not classified as a new historical Documentation Framework release.

---

## 44. Semantic Version Impact

Current framework version remains:

```text
1.0.0
```

because the current work primarily resolves repository structure and governance metadata while preserving framework semantics.

---

## 45. Future Change Classification

Future changes SHOULD be classified by impact.

### Editorial

Examples:

* spelling;
* grammar;
* formatting;
* non-semantic clarification.

Typical version impact:

```text
None
```

---

### Structural

Examples:

* file organization;
* manifest changes;
* numbering changes;
* repository normalization.

Typical version impact:

```text
May be none
```

when normative semantics remain unchanged.

---

### Compatible Semantic

Examples:

* additional optional metadata;
* compatible templates;
* new validation capabilities;
* new automation capabilities.

Possible version impact:

```text
MINOR
```

---

### Breaking Semantic

Examples:

* incompatible lifecycle rules;
* incompatible metadata contracts;
* incompatible governance;
* incompatible mandatory templates;
* incompatible release semantics.

Possible version impact:

```text
MAJOR
```

```

---

## 47. Historical Integrity Principle

EPIC-DOC-001 repository evolution SHALL preserve both:

```text
what historically existed
```

and:

```text
what is canonically valid now
```

No normalization action SHALL fabricate historical Git release evidence.

---

## 48. Validation Principle

Validation SHALL remain evidence-driven:

```text
Execute
   ↓
Observe
   ↓
Evaluate
   ↓
Record
```

Current evidence supports:

```text
Repository Validation: Validated
Final Revalidation:    Validated
EPIC-DOC-001 REVALIDATION: PASS
```

---

## 49. Closure Principle

Revalidation success does not by itself mean the repository closure sequence has been completed.

Until the normalization commits are created, pushed, remotely verified, and the final working tree is clean:

```text
Final Commit Created: true
Working Tree Clean:   true
EPIC Closed:          true
```

These states SHALL only advance when the corresponding repository evidence exists.

## 50. Summary

The current EPIC-DOC-001 revision normalizes the FamilyOS Documentation Framework repository structure without rewriting historical framework identity.

The normalization:

1. removes ten duplicate generic skeleton documents;
2. retains substantive framework documentation;
3. introduces `00-EPIC.md`;
4. establishes canonical range `00-23`;
5. establishes 24 numbered documents;
6. preserves seven canonical control documents;
7. establishes a 31-file filesystem contract;
8. classifies the historical release as `DOCUMENTARY ONLY`;
9. preserves the absence of a dedicated historical Documentation Framework Git tag;
10. validates repository structure and metadata;
11. passes Ruff, MyPy, Pytest, and DiffCheck;
12. records current repository validation and final revalidation as `Validated`.
