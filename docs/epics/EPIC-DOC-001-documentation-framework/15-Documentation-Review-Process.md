# Documentation Framework

## 15 Documentation Review Process

### Context

Documentation review is a critical activity in the FamilyOS documentation lifecycle.

A review process ensures that official documentation is:

* technically accurate,
* structurally compliant,
* understandable,
* aligned with architecture decisions,
* consistent with FamilyOS standards.

The Documentation Review Process defines how documentation changes are evaluated before approval and publication.

---

## Documentation Review Principles

FamilyOS documentation reviews follow these principles.

### Quality Assurance

Every official document must receive appropriate validation before publication.

---

### Collaborative Improvement

Reviews are collaborative processes designed to improve documentation quality.

---

### Traceability

All review decisions must remain visible and connected to:

* commits,
* pull requests,
* issues,
* RFCs,
* ADRs,
* EPICs,
* specifications.

---

### Appropriate Review Level

The review depth depends on the document type and impact.

---

## Review Process Overview

The standard review workflow is:

```text id="1a3h9n"
Documentation Change

        |
        v

Author Validation

        |
        v

Peer Review

        |
        v

Technical Review

        |
        v

Governance Approval

        |
        v

Publication
```

---

## Review Initiation

A documentation review begins when:

* a new document is created,
* an existing document is modified,
* a lifecycle transition occurs,
* a normative change is proposed.

---

### Review Request Requirements

The author must provide:

* document identifier,
* change description,
* related artifacts,
* expected impact,
* validation information.

Example:

```markdown id="k8x5un"
Document:
EPIC-DOC-001

Change:
Added documentation automation rules

Related:
SPEC-0005 v1.0.0
```

---

## Author Validation

Before requesting review, the author must verify:

* template compliance,
* formatting rules,
* metadata correctness,
* references,
* spelling and clarity.

The author is responsible for the initial quality level.

---

## Peer Review

Peer review validates general documentation quality.

Reviewers check:

### Structure

* required sections exist,
* organization is correct,
* formatting follows standards.

---

### Clarity

* concepts are understandable,
* terminology is consistent,
* explanations are complete.

---

### Consistency

* no contradictions exist,
* related documents remain aligned.

---

## Technical Review

Technical review is required when documentation affects:

* architecture,
* specifications,
* APIs,
* plugins,
* security,
* domain models.

Technical reviewers validate:

* correctness,
* implementation alignment,
* compatibility impact.

---

## Architecture Review

Architecture review is required for documents affecting:

* system design,
* boundaries,
* major technical decisions.

Examples:

* ADRs,
* architecture documents,
* major RFCs.

---

## Security Review

Security review is required for documentation involving:

* authentication,
* authorization,
* sensitive data,
* security policies.

---

## Review Comments

Review comments must be:

* specific,
* actionable,
* respectful,
* technically justified.

Good review:

```text id="x0yn4p"
The lifecycle state should reference the Documentation Lifecycle model defined in 09-Documentation-Lifecycle.md.
```

Poor review:

```text id="5qrm7p"
This is wrong.
```

---

## Review Resolution

Authors must address review feedback.

Resolution options:

* accepted and changed,
* discussed and rejected with justification,
* deferred with tracking issue.

---

## Review Approval

A document is approved when:

* required reviewers approve,
* mandatory feedback is resolved,
* quality gates pass,
* governance requirements are satisfied.

---

## Review Status Model

Recommended review states:

```yaml id="z1v6s8"
review:
  status: approved
  reviewers:
    - documentation-team
    - architecture-team
```

Possible statuses:

* pending,
* changes-requested,
* approved,
* rejected.

---

## Pull Request Integration

Documentation reviews should use Git pull requests.

Recommended workflow:

```text id="6wz1gi"
Create Branch

      |

Commit Documentation

      |

Open Pull Request

      |

Run Validation

      |

---

## Review Exceptions

Exceptions may be granted for:

* urgent documentation fixes,
* emergency releases,
* critical corrections.

Exceptions require:

* documented reason,
* responsible approval,
* follow-up review.

---

## Review Metrics

Documentation review quality may be measured through:

### Review Coverage

Percentage of documents reviewed before publication.

---

### Review Duration

Time between review request and approval.

---

### Defect Detection

Number of issues discovered during review.

---

### Documentation Stability

Number of post-publication corrections.

---

## Governance Integration

The Documentation Review Process integrates with:

* Documentation Governance,
* Documentation Quality Gates,
* Documentation Lifecycle,
* Release Framework,
* Quality Framework.

---

## Relationship With Other Frameworks

This process depends on:

* Documentation Standards,
* Documentation Templates,
* Documentation Versioning,
* Repository Organization.

---

## Final Compliance

A documentation review process is compliant when:

* reviews are controlled,
* responsibilities are defined,
* decisions are traceable,
* quality requirements are verified,
* approved documents follow governance rules.

The Documentation Review Process ensures that FamilyOS documentation remains accurate, trustworthy, and maintainable throughout its lifecycle.
