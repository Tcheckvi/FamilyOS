# Documentation Framework

## 20 Documentation Framework Validation

### Context

The FamilyOS Documentation Framework establishes the foundation for creating, maintaining, validating, and evolving official documentation across the ecosystem.

Before being considered complete, the framework must be validated against its objectives, standards, governance rules, and integration requirements.

This document defines the validation criteria required to confirm that the Documentation Framework is ready for adoption.

---

## Validation Principles

FamilyOS documentation framework validation follows these principles.

### Completeness

All required documentation framework components must exist.

---

### Consistency

All documents must follow the same standards and terminology.

---

### Traceability

Framework decisions must remain connected to:

* EPICs,
* RFCs,
* ADRs,
* SPECs,
* repository history.

---

### Maintainability

The framework must support long-term evolution.

---

## Documentation Framework Validation Model

Validation is organized into the following areas:

```text id="7d4x9p"
Documentation Framework Validation

├── Structure Validation
├── Content Validation
├── Governance Validation
├── Automation Validation
├── Quality Validation
└── Integration Validation
```

---

## Structure Validation

### Objective

Verify that the Documentation Framework has a complete and consistent structure.

---

### Validation Criteria

The framework must provide:

* documentation principles,
* standards,
* versioning rules,
* lifecycle management,
* governance rules,
* templates,
* automation guidance,
* quality gates.

---

### Result

Expected:

```text id="x9a2kd"
PASS
```

---

## Content Validation

### Objective

Verify that documentation concepts are clearly defined.

---

### Validation Criteria

Documentation must:

* define responsibilities,
* explain processes,
* describe rules,
* provide examples,
* reference related frameworks.

---

### Result

Expected:

```text id="z4w8tm"
PASS
```

---

## Governance Validation

### Objective

Verify that documentation ownership and decision processes are defined.

---

### Validation Criteria

The framework must define:

* ownership model,
* review process,
* approval workflow,
* lifecycle control.

---

### Result

Expected:

```text id="r6k2vz"
PASS
```

---

## Versioning Validation

### Objective

Verify that documentation evolution is controlled.

---

### Validation Criteria

The framework must define:

* semantic versioning,
* change classification,
* migration strategy,
* deprecation handling.

---

### Result

Expected:

```text id="n8v5qj"
PASS
```

---

## Template Validation

### Objective

Verify that official documentation templates exist.

---

### Validation Criteria

Templates must cover:

* EPIC,
* RFC,
* ADR,
* SPEC,
* Plugin documentation,
* Guides.

---

### Result

Expected:

```text id="m3x7qa"
PASS
```

---

## Automation Validation

### Objective

Verify that documentation automation principles are defined.

---

### Validation Criteria

The framework must define:

* validation automation,
* metadata checking,
* reference verification,
* CI/CD integration.

---

### Result

Expected:

```text id="h7p3ws"
PASS
```

---

## Quality Validation

### Objective

Verify that documentation quality management is defined.

---

### Validation Criteria

The framework must provide:

* quality gates,
* review process,
* quality metrics,
* maintenance rules.

---

### Result

Expected:

```text id="q5m8yx"
PASS
```

---

## Repository Validation

### Objective

Verify documentation repository organization.

---

### Validation Criteria

The framework must define:

* directory organization,
* naming conventions,
* artifact locations,
* indexing strategy.

---

### Result

Expected:

```text id="c8n4kp"
PASS
```

---

## Integration Validation

### Objective

Verify integration with the wider FamilyOS engineering ecosystem.

---

### Required Integrations

The Documentation Framework integrates with:

* Engineering Foundation,
* Quality Framework,
* Testing Framework,
* Build Framework,
* Release Framework,
* Plugin Framework.

---

### Result

Expected:

```text id="v2j6mr"
PASS
```

## Validation Checklist

Final checklist:

```text id="8f1qzs"
□ Documentation standards defined
□ Documentation lifecycle defined
□ Versioning strategy defined
□ Governance model defined
□ Templates defined
□ Automation strategy defined
□ Quality gates defined
□ Repository organization defined
□ Review process defined
□ Maintenance process defined
□ Migration strategy defined
□ Deprecation policy defined
□ Metrics defined
```

---

## Validation Report

Example:

```yaml id="u9k4pc"
documentation_framework:
  status: validated
  version: 1.0.0
  validated_date: 2026-08-06

quality:
  structure: passed
  governance: passed
  automation: passed
  integration: passed
```

---

## Framework Readiness

After successful validation, the Documentation Framework is considered ready for:

* adoption by FamilyOS contributors,
* integration with engineering workflows,
* use by official plugins,
* connection with future framework EPICs.

---

## Governance Approval

Final approval requires:

* documentation owner approval,
* quality validation,
* architecture confirmation when required.

---

## Relationship With Other Frameworks

This validation enables integration with:

* EPIC-ENG-001 — Engineering Foundation,
* EPIC-TST-001 — Testing Framework,
* EPIC-QLT-001 — Quality Framework,
* EPIC-BLD-001 — Build Framework,
* EPIC-REL-001 — Release Framework.

---

## Final Compliance

The Documentation Framework is compliant when:

* all validation areas pass,
* governance rules are applied,
* quality requirements are satisfied,
* documentation remains maintainable,
* future evolution is supported.

The successful validation of EPIC-DOC-001 establishes documentation as a formal engineering foundation of the FamilyOS platform.
