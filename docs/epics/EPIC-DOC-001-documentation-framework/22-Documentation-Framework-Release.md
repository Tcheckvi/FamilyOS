# Documentation Framework

## 22 Documentation Framework Release

### Context

The Documentation Framework represents a foundational capability of the FamilyOS engineering ecosystem.

After completing design, validation, governance definition, and quality verification, the framework can transition from development status to official release status.

This document defines the release requirements, validation process, and publication rules for EPIC-DOC-001.

---

## Release Objectives

The Documentation Framework release aims to:

* establish the official documentation foundation,
* provide stable documentation rules,
* enable consistent future contributions,
* support engineering framework integration.

---

## Release Principles

FamilyOS documentation releases follow these principles.

### Stability

Released documentation represents an approved and reliable reference.

---

### Traceability

Every release must be connected to:

* repository state,
* version identifier,
* validation results,
* changelog.

---

### Reproducibility

A release must be reproducible from repository history.

---

### Compatibility

Release changes must consider existing documentation consumers.
