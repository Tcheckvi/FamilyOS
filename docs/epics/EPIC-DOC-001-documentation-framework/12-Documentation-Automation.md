# Documentation Framework

## 12 Documentation Automation

### Context

As the FamilyOS ecosystem grows, manual documentation management becomes increasingly difficult.

A large engineering platform requires automated processes to maintain:

* documentation consistency,
* structural compliance,
* reference integrity,
* version accuracy,
* repository organization.

Documentation automation defines the mechanisms that support validation, generation, indexing, and continuous improvement of FamilyOS documentation.

---

## Documentation Automation Principles

FamilyOS documentation automation follows these principles.

### Reliability

Automated checks must provide predictable and reproducible results.

---

### Transparency

Automation rules must be understandable and documented.

---

### Non-Intrusive Evolution

Automation must improve documentation quality without limiting legitimate contributions.

---

### Continuous Validation

Documentation quality should be verified continuously during development.

---

## Automation Objectives

Documentation automation provides support for:

* structural validation,
* metadata validation,
* reference verification,
* formatting checks,
* documentation indexing,
* lifecycle tracking,
* release integration.

---

## Documentation Validation Pipeline

The recommended validation pipeline is:

```text
Documentation Change
        |
        v
Markdown Validation
        |
        v
Metadata Validation
        |
        v
Reference Validation
        |
        v
Quality Checks
        |
        v
Documentation Approval
```

---

## Markdown Validation

Markdown validation ensures documents follow FamilyOS formatting standards.

Checks include:

* heading hierarchy,
* valid Markdown syntax,
* code block formatting,
* table formatting,
* broken links.

Example validation command:

```bash
markdownlint docs/
```

---

## Metadata Validation

Official documents require valid metadata.

Automation verifies:

* document identifier,
* version,
* status,
* ownership,
* dates.

Example:

```yaml
document:
  id: DOC-001
  version: 1.0.0
  status: approved
```

---

## Reference Validation

Documentation references must remain valid.

Automation verifies:

* referenced files exist,
* identifiers are correct,
* versions are specified when required.

Examples:

Valid:

```text
SPEC-0005 v1.0.0
```

Invalid:

```text
SPEC-0005
```

---

## Structure Validation

Templates define required sections.

Automation verifies that documents contain:

* mandatory headings,
* required metadata,
* expected structure.

Example:

```text
RFC Document

✓ Context
✓ Goals
✓ Architecture
✓ Validation
```

---

## Documentation Index Generation

Automation may generate documentation indexes.

Generated information may include:

* document list,
* versions,
* lifecycle states,
* ownership,
* relationships.

Example:

```text
Documentation Index

DOC-001
Status: Maintained
Version: 1.2.0

RFC-0015
Status: Approved
Version: 1.0.0
```

---

## Documentation Dependency Mapping

Automation can analyze relationships between documents.

Examples:

```text
EPIC-DOC-001
       |
       +-- RFC references
       |
       +-- SPEC references
       |
       +-- ADR references
```

This improves traceability.

---

## CI/CD Integration

Documentation validation should integrate with continuous integration workflows.

Example pipeline:

```yaml
documentation:
  checks:
    - markdown
    - metadata
    - references
    - templates
```

---

## Pull Request Validation

Documentation changes should automatically trigger validation.

Recommended checks:

* formatting validation,
* broken reference detection,
* template compliance,
* version verification.

---

## Documentation Generation

Future automation may generate:

* documentation indexes,
* API references,
* plugin catalogs,
* architecture maps.

Generated content must remain distinguishable from manually written documentation.

---

## Documentation Automation Tools

Potential tools include:

### Markdown Tools

Purpose:

* syntax validation,
* style enforcement.

---

### Static Analysis Tools

Purpose:

* consistency checks,
* reference analysis.

---

### Custom FamilyOS Validators

Purpose:

* domain-specific rules,
* governance validation,
* architecture compliance.

---

## Automation Rules

The following rules apply:

1. Automation must not replace human review.
2. Generated documentation must be identifiable.
3. Validation failures must provide actionable feedback.
4. Automation rules must be versioned.
5. Automation changes require review.

---

## Documentation Automation Lifecycle

Automation itself follows a lifecycle:

```text
Design
 |
 v
Implementation
 |
 v
Validation
 |
 v
Deployment
 |
 v
Maintenance
```

---

## Governance Integration

Documentation automation is governed by:

* Documentation Governance,
* Quality Framework,
* Engineering Foundation,
* Release Framework.

---

## Relationship With Other Frameworks

Documentation automation integrates with:

* Documentation Standards,
* Documentation Templates,
* Documentation Lifecycle,
* Documentation Versioning,
* CI/CD Framework.

---

## Final Compliance

Documentation automation is compliant when:

* validation rules are defined,
* automation is reproducible,
* integration points are documented,
* failures are actionable,
* governance is respected.

Documentation automation enables FamilyOS to scale its knowledge ecosystem while preserving quality and reliability.
