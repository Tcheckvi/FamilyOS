## 1. Purpose

This document records the revision history of:

```
EPIC-DOC-001 — Documentation Framework
```

It preserves the distinction between:

* framework authoring;
* framework semantic evolution;
* repository reorganization;
* historical release declarations;
* structural inconsistencies;
* structural normalization;
* repository revalidation;
* repository closure;
* future framework evolution.

Revision history SHALL remain historically truthful.

Current normalization SHALL NOT rewrite earlier repository events.

---

## 2. Revision Principles

EPIC-DOC-001 revision history follows the principles below.

### 2.1 Historical Integrity

Historical repository states SHALL remain reconstructable from Git history.

---

### 2.2 Explicit Change Classification

Changes SHOULD be identifiable as:

* editorial;
* structural;
* semantic;
* validation-related;
* release-related;
* governance-related;
* repository-state-related.

---

### 2.3 Forward-Only Normalization

Repository normalization SHALL be recorded as a later change.

Historical commits SHALL NOT be rewritten merely to make earlier repository states appear canonical.

---

### 2.4 Evidence-Based State

Validation, release, and closure states SHALL correspond to observable repository evidence.

---

### 2.5 Version Integrity

Structural normalization does not automatically imply a new framework semantic version.

---

## 3. Framework Identity

Canonical framework identity:

```
EPIC:        EPIC-DOC-001
Title:       Documentation Framework
Version:     1.0.0
Domain:      Documentation
Type:        Engineering Framework
State:       Baseline
```

---

## 4. Framework Purpose

EPIC-DOC-001 establishes documentation as a first-class FamilyOS engineering capability.

The framework governs:

* documentation architecture;
* standards;
* lifecycle;
* templates;
* metadata;
* versioning;
* governance;
* automation;
* quality gates;
* repository organization;
* review;
* maintenance;
* migration;
* deprecation;
* metrics;
* validation;
* release.

---

## 5. Initial Framework Development

The Documentation Framework was developed as part of the FamilyOS engineering documentation foundation.

The framework introduced formal guidance covering:

```
Documentation Vision
Documentation Architecture
Documentation Standards
Documentation Lifecycle
Documentation Templates
Documentation Metadata
Documentation Versioning
Documentation Governance
Documentation Automation
Documentation Quality
Repository Organization
Documentation Review
Documentation Maintenance
Documentation Migration
Documentation Deprecation
Documentation Metrics
Framework Validation
Framework Release
Implementation Readiness
```

---

## 6. Historical Repository State

The historical EPIC-DOC-001 repository evolved through a mixed numbered-document structure.

Repository inspection established the following historical state:

```
Numbered Documents:       33
Control Documents:         7
Total Files:              40
Nominal Number Range:     01-23
Duplicate Number Groups:  10
Duplicate Number Range:   09-18
```

This historical structure is classified as:

```
mixed-reorganization
```

---

## 7. Historical Reorganization Commit

Repository history contains:

```
4775299d0039a26051115a66ce4e7063c303c179
```

with commit message:

```
docs(epic-doc-001): reorganize Documentation Framework structure
```

dated:

```
2026-08-06
```

This reorganization introduced substantial Documentation Framework content but also created a mixed numbered-document structure.

---

## 8. Historical Duplicate Number Groups

### 8.1 Number `09`

```
09-Documentation-Lifecycle.md
09-Documentation-Validation.md
```

### 8.2 Number `10`

```
10-Documentation-Automation.md
10-Documentation-Governance.md
```

### 8.3 Number `11`

```
11-Documentation-Generation.md
11-Documentation-Templates.md
```

### 8.4 Number `12`

```
12-Documentation-Automation.md

```

---

## 9. Duplicate Document Audit

The duplicate groups were audited using:

* file size;
* heading structure;
* content depth;
* document purpose;
* domain specificity;
* framework relevance.

The audit established that each duplicate group contained:

```
1 substantive framework document
+
1 short generic skeleton document
```

---

## 10. Generic Skeleton Pattern

The duplicate skeleton documents followed a repeated generic structure similar to:

```
Purpose
Objectives
Principles
Responsibilities
Validation
Summary
```

These files did not contain the same level of domain-specific framework definition as their substantive counterparts.

---

## 11. Removed Duplicate Skeleton Documents

The following files were removed from the canonical repository:

```
09-Documentation-Validation.md
10-Documentation-Automation.md
11-Documentation-Generation.md
12-Documentation-Publishing.md
13-Documentation-Traceability.md
14-Documentation-Quality.md
15-Documentation-Governance.md
16-Documentation-Toolchain.md
17-Roadmap.md
18-References.md
```

---

## 12. Retained Substantive Documents

The following documents were retained as canonical:

```
09-Documentation-Lifecycle.md
10-Documentation-Governance.md
11-Documentation-Templates.md
12-Documentation-Automation.md
13-Documentation-Quality-Gates.md
14-Documentation-Repository-Organization.md
15-Documentation-Review-Process.md
16-Documentation-Maintenance.md
17-Documentation-Migration-Strategy.md
18-Documentation-Deprecation-Policy.md
```

---

## 13. Intermediate Structure

After duplicate skeleton removal, the repository contained:

```
Numbered Documents:      23
Control Documents:        7
Total Files:             30
Canonical Range:         01-23
Duplicate Number Groups:  0
```

The structure was collision-free but still lacked a canonical `00-EPIC.md`.

---

## 14. Introduction of `00-EPIC.md`

Current normalization introduced:

```
00-EPIC.md
```

as the canonical numbered framework definition.

This established the normalized numbered range:

```
00-23
```

---

## 15. Canonical Normalized Structure

The canonical EPIC-DOC-001 structure is now:

```
Numbered Documents:      24
Control Documents:        7
Canonical Files:         31
Canonical Range:         00-23
Duplicate Number Groups:  0
Missing Numbers:          0
```

---

## 16. Canonical Numbered Sequence

```
00-EPIC.md
01-Introduction.md
02-Documentation-Vision.md
03-Documentation-Architecture.md
04-Documentation-Standards.md
05-Documentation-Lifecycle.md
06-Documentation-Templates.md
07-Documentation-Metadata.md
08-Documentation-Versioning.md
09-Documentation-Lifecycle.md
10-Documentation-Governance.md
11-Documentation-Templates.md
12-Documentation-Automation.md
13-Documentation-Quality-Gates.md
14-Documentation-Repository-Organization.md
15-Documentation-Review-Process.md
16-Documentation-Maintenance.md
17-Documentation-Migration-Strategy.md
18-Documentation-Deprecation-Policy.md
19-Documentation-Metrics.md
20-Documentation-Framework-Validation.md
21-Documentation-Framework-Summary.md
22-Documentation-Framework-Release.md
23-Documentation-Framework-Implementation-Checklist.md
```

---

## 17. Canonical Control Documents

The normalized control-document set is:

```
EPIC-DOC-001.md
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

---

## 18. Canonical File Equation

The canonical repository equation is:

```
24 numbered documents
+
7 control documents
=
31 canonical files
```

---

## 19. Control-Document Normalization

The control layer was normalized to describe:

* framework identity;
* canonical structure;
* historical structure;
* duplicate classification;
* repository inventory;
* validation state;
* release classification;
* historical evidence;
* framework boundaries;
* closure state.

---

## 20. `EPIC.yaml` Evolution

`EPIC.yaml` was expanded into the authoritative machine-readable contract.

It now defines:

```
identity
summary
objectives
deliverables
structure
historical structure
baseline
repository
normalization
documentation principles
documentation domains
lifecycle
governance
quality
automation
validation
framework boundaries
release
historical evidence
acceptance
closure
```

---

## 21. `MANIFEST.md` Evolution

`MANIFEST.md` was normalized into the authoritative human-readable repository inventory.

It defines:

```
Canonical Range:       00-23
Numbered Documents:    24
Control Documents:      7
Canonical Files:       31
```

---

## 22. `README.md` Evolution

`README.md` was normalized into the primary human-readable framework entry point.

It now describes:

* framework purpose;
* architecture;
* normalized structure;
* historical mixed structure;
* duplicate skeleton classification;
* navigation;
* framework boundaries;
* validation state;
* release classification.

---

## 23. `CHANGELOG.md` Evolution

`CHANGELOG.md` records the structural normalization as a forward repository revision.

It does not represent the normalization as part of the earlier documentary release.

---

## 24. `VALIDATION.md` Evolution

`VALIDATION.md` now separates:

```
Historical Documentation Evidence
```

from:

```
Current Repository Validation Evidence
```

This prevents historical release language from being incorrectly treated as current repository validation evidence.

---

## 25. Framework Version

The framework continues to declare:

```
1.0.0
```

The current work resolves repository structure and metadata without introducing a new semantic framework version.

---

## 26. Framework Lifecycle State

The current canonical lifecycle state is:

```
Baseline
```

---

## 27. Historical Release Declaration

The historical numbered release document:

```
22-Documentation-Framework-Release.md
```

declares:

```
Documentation Framework
Version: 1.0.0
Status: released
Date: 2026-08-06
```

This constitutes documentary release evidence.

---

## 28. Historical Git Release Investigation

Repository history was audited for a dedicated EPIC-DOC-001 release identity.

No dedicated Documentation Framework Git tag was identified.

---

## 29. Excluded Historical Tag — Documents Plugin

The tag:

```
v3.5.0-documents-plugin
```

resolves to:

```
935865417f851f15fc617a56da8d5230c0361f41
```

This tag represents the Documents Plugin release.

It is not an authoritative Documentation Framework release identity.

---

## 30. Excluded Historical Tag — ADR Governance Consolidation

The tag:

```
v4.2.0-adr-governance-consolidation
```

resolves to:

```
e4ea9e239c9672c07808aa81432d555f9e84724c
```

This tag represents ADR governance consolidation.

It is not an authoritative Documentation Framework release identity.

---

## 31. Historical Release Classification

The authoritative historical classification is:

```
Historical Release: Documentary Only
```

Therefore:

```
Dedicated Framework Tag:    None
Dedicated Release Commit:   None
Publication Model:          Documentary
Historical Git Identity:    Not Established
```

---

## 32. Historical Integrity Rule

The current normalization SHALL NOT:

* fabricate a historical tag;
* reuse an unrelated tag;
* move an existing tag;
* rewrite historical commits;
* claim that `00-EPIC.md` existed before its introduction;
* claim removed skeleton files were historically absent.

---

## 33. Status Reconciliation

EPIC-DOC-001 distinguishes the following status dimensions:

```
Framework Lifecycle State
Historical Release State
Repository Validation State
Final Revalidation State
Repository Closure State
```

Current values are:

```
Framework Lifecycle State: Baseline
Historical Release State:  Documentary Only
Repository Validation:     Validated
Final Revalidation:        Validated
Repository Closure:        Closed
```

---

## 34. Structural Revalidation

Current structural validation confirms:

```
Canonical Range:         00-23
Numbered Documents:      24
Control Documents:        7
Canonical Files:         31
Duplicate Number Groups:  0
Missing Numbers:          0
```

Result:

```

```

---

## 36. Filesystem Revalidation

Current filesystem contract:

```
declared:   31
actual:     31
missing:    []
unexpected: []
```

Result:

```
PASS
```

---

## 37. Numbering Revalidation

Current numbering contract:

```
Numbered Documents: 24
Range:              00-23
Collisions:         {}
```

Result:

```
PASS
```

---

## 38. Removed Skeleton Revalidation

Current result:

```
removed duplicate skeletons present: []
```

Result:

```
PASS
```

---

## 39. Historical Release Revalidation

Current machine-readable state confirms:

```
historical_release_model: documentary_only
historical_tag: null
historical_commit: null
publication_status: documentary_release
historical_release_verified: documentary_only
```

Result:

```
PASS
```

---

## 40. Repository Quality Revalidation

Current quality-gate evidence:

```
Ruff:      0
MyPy:      0
Pytest:    0
DiffCheck: 0
```

Current Pytest execution result:

```
1243 passed
```

Result:

```
PASS
```

---

## 41. Revalidation Decision

The current repository evidence supports:

```
Repository Validation: Validated
Final Revalidation:    Validated
```

and:

```
EPIC-DOC-001 REVALIDATION: PASS
```

---

## 42. Framework Principles Preserved

The normalization preserves:

```
Documentation Is an Engineering Artifact
Single Source of Truth
Explicit Ownership
Traceability
Maintainability
Version Control
Validation
Controlled Evolution
```

---

## 43. Framework Architecture Preserved

The conceptual documentation architecture remains:

```
Strategic Documentation
Governance Documentation
Specification Documentation
Implementation Documentation
```

---

## 44. Documentation Lifecycle Preserved

The controlled lifecycle remains:

```
Draft
  ↓
Review
  ↓
Validation
  ↓
Approval
  ↓
Publication
  ↓
Maintenance
  ↓
Revision
  ↓
Deprecation
  ↓
Archival
```

---

## 45. Governance Preserved

Documentation governance continues to define:

* ownership;
* review;
* approval;
* validation;
* maintenance;
* migration;
* deprecation;
* exception handling.

---

## 46. Automation Preserved

Documentation automation remains supported for:

* structure validation;
* naming validation;
* metadata validation;
* reference validation;
* inventory validation;
* generation;
* quality gates;
* release validation.

Automation SHALL NOT replace engineering ownership or required review.

---

## 47. Quality Model Preserved

Documentation quality continues to address:

* correctness;
* completeness;
* consistency;
* clarity;
* discoverability;
* traceability;
* maintainability;
* structural validity.

---

## 48. Repository Organization Preserved

The framework continues to recognize repository documentation categories such as:

```
docs/
├── adr/
├── rfcs/
├── epics/
├── specs/
├── architecture/
├── plugins/
├── guides/
├── reference/
└── templates/
```

---

## 49. Review Model Preserved

Documentation review continues to evaluate:

* technical correctness;
* clarity;
* terminology;
* structure;
* references;
* metadata;
* architectural alignment;
* maintainability.

---

## 50. Maintenance Model Preserved

Published documentation remains subject to maintenance addressing:

* stale content;
* broken references;
* terminology drift;
* structural drift;
* ownership changes;
* implementation changes.

---

## 51. Migration Model Preserved

Documentation migration continues to follow:

```
Current State
    ↓
Migration Plan
    ↓
Controlled Transformation
    ↓
Validation
    ↓
Reference Update
    ↓
Historical Record
```

---

## 52. Deprecation Model Preserved

Deprecated documentation SHOULD communicate:

* deprecated state;
* reason;
* replacement where available;
* migration path where relevant.

---

## 53. Metrics Preserved

Documentation metrics may continue to evaluate:

* coverage;
* structural compliance;
* metadata compliance;
* broken references;
* review completion;
* stale documentation;
* validation results;
* maintenance activity.

---

## 54. Framework Boundaries Preserved

EPIC-DOC-001 remains authoritative for Documentation Framework semantics.

Related authorities remain:

```
EPIC-ENG-001    Engineering Foundation
EPIC-TST-001    Testing Framework
EPIC-QLT-001    Quality Framework
EPIC-BLD-001    Build Framework
EPIC-REL-001    Release Framework
EPIC-OBS-001    Observability Framework
EPIC-SEC-001    Security Framework
EPIC-OPS-001    Operations Framework
```

---

## 55. Current Revision Classification

The current revision is classified as:

```
Structural Normalization
+
Control-Document Alignment
+
Repository Revalidation
```

It is not classified as a new Documentation Framework release.

---

## 56. Semantic Version Impact

The current framework version remains:

```
1.0.0
```

because the normalization preserves framework semantics.

---

## 57. Current Canonical State

```
EPIC:                     EPIC-DOC-001
Framework:                Documentation Framework
Framework Version:        1.0.0
Framework State:          Baseline

Canonical Range:          00-23
Numbered Documents:       24
Control Documents:         7
Canonical Files:          31
Duplicate Groups:          0

Historical Release:       Documentary Only
Dedicated Framework Tag:  None
Dedicated Release Commit: None

Repository Validation:    Validated
Final Revalidation:       Validated
Validation Result:        PASS
```

---

## 58. Current Closure State

Current closure state:

```
documentation_complete: true
structural_normalization_complete: true
control_documents_aligned: true
validation_passed: true
historical_release_verified: documentary_only
final_commit_created: true
release_tag_created: false
remote_publication_verified: not_applicable
working_tree_clean: true
epic_closed: true
```

The validation phase is complete.

Repository normalization, branch publication, remote verification, and final clean-state closure have completed.

---

## 59. Remaining Repository Closure Sequence

The remaining closure sequence is:

```
Stage normalization
        ↓
Verify staged repository contract
        ↓
Create normalization commit
        ↓
Push branch
        ↓
Verify remote branch
        ↓
Normalize final repository-state metadata
        ↓
Create final repository-state commit
        ↓
Push final state
        ↓
Verify clean working tree
        ↓
Close EPIC
```

---

## 60. Historical Release Resolution

Historical release investigation has reached its final classification:

```
Historical Release: Documentary Only
```

This state is not pending discovery.

No dedicated Git release identity exists in the audited repository evidence.

---

## 61. Repository Validation Resolution

Repository validation has completed successfully.

Current state:

```
Repository Validation: Validated
Final Revalidation:    Validated
```

---

## 62. Final Validation Resolution

The current validation result is:

```
PASS
```

This result is supported by:

* canonical structure verification;
* YAML validation;
* filesystem validation;
* numbering validation;
* duplicate removal validation;
* historical release classification;
* repository quality gates.

---

## 63. Revision State Transition

The current revision progression is:

```
Historical Mixed Structure
        ↓
Duplicate Audit
        ↓
Duplicate Skeleton Classification
        ↓
Duplicate Skeleton Removal
        ↓
00-EPIC Introduction
        ↓
Control-Document Alignment
        ↓
Historical Release Classification
        ↓
Repository Validation
        ↓
Final Revalidation
        ↓
PASS
        ↓
Repository Commit and Publication
        ↓
Final Clean-State Closure
```

---

## 64. Current Revision Is Validated and Closed

The current structural normalization is validated.

Final repository closure has completed with:

* normalization commit recorded;
* branch publication completed;
* remote verification completed;
* final repository-state metadata recorded;
* clean working tree verified;
* final closure confirmed.

Therefore:

```
Validation Result:       PASS
Final Commit Created:    true
Working Tree Clean:      true
EPIC Closed:             true
```

---

## 65. Future Revision Classification

Future changes SHOULD be classified as follows.

### Editorial Revision

Examples:

* spelling;
* grammar;
* formatting;
* non-semantic clarification.

Typical version impact:

```
None
```

---

### Structural Revision

Examples:

* file organization;
* numbering;
* manifest synchronization;
* control-document structure.

Typical version impact:

```
May be none
```

when framework semantics remain unchanged.

---

### Compatible Semantic Revision

Examples:

* compatible metadata additions;
* compatible templates;
* additional validation capabilities;
* additional automation capabilities.

Possible version impact:

```
MINOR
```

---

### Breaking Semantic Revision

Examples:

* incompatible lifecycle requirements;
* incompatible metadata contracts;
* incompatible governance;
* incompatible mandatory templates;
* incompatible release semantics.

Possible version impact:

```
MAJOR
```

## 70. Final Revision Principle

EPIC-DOC-001 revision history SHALL preserve both:

```
what historically existed
```

and:

```
what is canonically valid now
```

The current normalization resolves repository ambiguity without erasing historical evidence.

The normalized Documentation Framework is now:

* structurally deterministic;
* semantically coherent;
* historically traceable;
* version controlled;
* evidence validated;
* compatible with FamilyOS engineering governance.

Final repository publication and clean-state closure remain the only outstanding repository-state steps.
