## 1. Executive Summary

EPIC-DOC-001 establishes the canonical **FamilyOS Documentation Framework**.

The framework defines how engineering documentation is:

* structured;
* created;
* reviewed;
* validated;
* versioned;
* governed;
* maintained;
* automated;
* organized;
* migrated;
* deprecated;
* measured;
* released;
* evolved.

FamilyOS treats documentation as a first-class engineering artifact.

Documentation is not considered a secondary activity performed after implementation. It is part of the engineering system itself and supports architecture, development, testing, quality, security, observability, operations, build, release management, plugin development, governance, and long-term knowledge preservation.

The Documentation Framework ensures that engineering knowledge remains:

* discoverable;
* understandable;
* traceable;
* maintainable;
* reviewable;
* reproducible;
* historically recoverable.

---

## 2. Vision

The FamilyOS Documentation Framework establishes a durable and scalable engineering knowledge system.

Its objective is to ensure that every significant engineering artifact can be:

```text
Created
   ↓
Structured
   ↓
Reviewed
   ↓
Validated
   ↓
Published
   ↓
Maintained
   ↓
Versioned
   ↓
Migrated
   ↓
Deprecated
   ↓
Preserved
```

Documentation SHALL evolve together with the systems, architectures, frameworks, and engineering processes it describes.

---

## 3. Context

FamilyOS is designed as a long-lived platform composed of multiple:

* domains;
* plugins;
* engineering frameworks;
* architectural decisions;
* RFCs;
* specifications;
* runtime capabilities;
* operational processes;
* security requirements;
* release mechanisms.

As the platform grows, engineering knowledge cannot depend on individual contributors or undocumented institutional memory.

Without a canonical documentation framework, repository documentation may develop:

* inconsistent structures;
* incompatible naming conventions;
* duplicated normative information;
* unclear ownership;
* missing traceability;
* stale references;
* uncontrolled lifecycle states;
* inconsistent metadata;
* weak validation;
* difficult maintenance;
* undocumented migrations;
* unreliable release evidence.

EPIC-DOC-001 establishes the documentation governance required to prevent these conditions.

---

## 4. Problem Statement

FamilyOS requires a canonical documentation system capable of preserving engineering knowledge throughout the platform lifecycle.

The system must establish consistent rules for:

* documentation architecture;
* file naming;
* structure;
* metadata;
* lifecycle management;
* templates;
* versioning;
* governance;
* automation;
* validation;
* quality gates;
* repository organization;
* reviews;
* maintenance;
* migrations;
* deprecation;
* metrics;
* framework validation;
* release management.

Without these rules, documentation quality and repository consistency cannot be reliably governed as FamilyOS scales.

---

## 5. Objectives

EPIC-DOC-001 SHALL establish the canonical FamilyOS Documentation Framework.

The framework SHALL:

1. define a consistent documentation architecture;
2. establish documentation standards and conventions;
3. define documentation lifecycle requirements;
4. establish reusable documentation templates;
5. define canonical metadata requirements;
6. establish documentation versioning rules;
7. define documentation governance responsibilities;
8. establish documentation automation capabilities;
9. define documentation quality gates;
10. establish repository organization requirements;
11. define documentation review processes;
12. establish maintenance requirements;
13. define migration strategies;
14. establish deprecation policies;
15. define documentation metrics;
16. establish framework-level validation requirements;
17. define documentation-framework release requirements;
18. preserve engineering knowledge;
19. improve traceability between engineering artifacts;
20. support long-term documentation automation and governance.

---

## 6. Scope

EPIC-DOC-001 governs engineering documentation maintained within the FamilyOS repository and associated engineering lifecycle.

The framework covers:

* documentation architecture;
* documentation standards;
* documentation lifecycle;
* documentation templates;
* documentation metadata;
* documentation versioning;
* documentation governance;
* documentation automation;
* documentation quality gates;
* documentation repository organization;
* documentation review;
* documentation maintenance;
* documentation migration;
* documentation deprecation;
* documentation metrics;
* documentation validation;
* documentation release;
* framework implementation readiness.

The framework applies to documentation associated with:

* architecture;
* ADRs;
* RFCs;
* EPICs;
* specifications;
* engineering frameworks;
* plugins;
* implementation guidance;
* testing;
* quality;
* security;
* observability;
* operations;
* build;
* release;
* reference material;
* templates;
* release evidence.

---

## 7. Out of Scope

EPIC-DOC-001 does not define the business behavior of individual FamilyOS domains.

It does not replace authoritative semantics belonging to:

* domain specifications;
* plugin specifications;
* security policies;
* testing architecture;
* quality governance;
* build engineering;
* release engineering;
* observability architecture;
* operations architecture.

EPIC-DOC-001 instead defines how documentation related to those domains SHALL be structured, governed, validated, maintained, and evolved.

---

## 8. Core Documentation Principles

### 8.1 Documentation Is an Engineering Artifact

Documentation SHALL be treated with engineering discipline appropriate to its importance.

---

### 8.2 Single Source of Truth

Canonical information SHOULD have one authoritative location.

Uncontrolled normative duplication SHOULD be avoided.

---

### 8.3 Explicit Ownership

Important documentation SHALL have identifiable ownership or an explicitly governed maintenance responsibility.

---

### 8.4 Traceability

Important documentation SHOULD be traceable to relevant engineering context.

Potential relationships include:

* EPICs;
* RFCs;
* ADRs;
* specifications;
* implementations;
* tests;
* builds;
* releases;
* operational evidence.

---

### 8.5 Maintainability

Documentation SHALL remain understandable and safely maintainable by contributors other than its original author.

---

### 8.6 Version Control

Canonical FamilyOS documentation SHALL be maintained under repository version control.

---

### 8.7 Validation

Documentation SHALL be subject to appropriate structural, semantic, and repository validation.

---

### 8.8 Controlled Evolution

Documentation evolution SHALL preserve appropriate historical traceability.

---

## 9. Documentation Architecture

The FamilyOS documentation architecture is organized into complementary layers.

### 9.1 Strategic Documentation

Strategic documentation expresses high-level engineering direction.

Examples include:

* EPICs;
* vision documents;
* roadmaps;
* framework definitions.

---

### 9.2 Governance Documentation

Governance documentation defines engineering rules and decision structures.

Examples include:

* policies;
* standards;
* ADRs;
* governance models;
* lifecycle definitions.

---

### 9.3 Specification Documentation

Specification documentation defines technical contracts and expected behavior.

Examples include:

* RFCs;
* technical specifications;
* interface contracts;
* plugin contracts;
* architecture specifications.

---

### 9.4 Implementation Documentation

Implementation documentation supports engineering execution.

Examples include:

* implementation guides;
* migration guides;
* operational guides;
* reference documentation;
* templates;
* examples.

---

## 10. Canonical Repository Structure

The normalized canonical range for EPIC-DOC-001 is:

```text
00-23
```

The framework contains:

```text
24 numbered documents
7 control documents
31 canonical files
```

---

## 11. Canonical Numbered Documents

The canonical numbered-document set is:

```text
00-EPIC.md
01-Introduction.md
02-Documentation-Vision.md
03-Documentation-Architecture.md
04-Documentation-Standards.md
05-Documentation-Lifecycle.md
06-Documentation-Templates.md
07-Documentation-Metadata.md
08-Documentation-Versioning.md
09-Documentation-Lifecycle.md
10-Documentation-Governance.md

13-Documentation-Quality-Gates.md
14-Documentation-Repository-Organization.md
15-Documentation-Review-Process.md
16-Documentation-Maintenance.md
17-Documentation-Migration-Strategy.md
18-Documentation-Deprecation-Policy.md
19-Documentation-Metrics.md
20-Documentation-Framework-Validation.md
21-Documentation-Framework-Summary.md
22-Documentation-Framework-Release.md
23-Documentation-Framework-Implementation-Checklist.md
```

Each numeric prefix SHALL occur exactly once.

---

## 12. Control Documents

The canonical control-document set is:

```text
EPIC-DOC-001.md
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

These documents provide repository-level governance.

---

## 13. Control Document Responsibilities

### `EPIC-DOC-001.md`

Provides the consolidated EPIC-level framework definition and status.

### `EPIC.yaml`

Provides the machine-readable framework and repository contract.

### `README.md`

Provides the human-readable framework entry point and navigation.

### `MANIFEST.md`

Defines the canonical repository inventory.

### `CHANGELOG.md`

Records framework and repository evolution.

### `VALIDATION.md`

Defines and records validation requirements and evidence.

### `Revision-History.md`

Preserves historical framework and structural evolution.

---

## 14. Historical Structural State

Before current normalization, repository inspection identified:

```text
Numbered Documents:       33
Control Documents:         7
Total Files:              40
Nominal Range:            01-23
Duplicate Number Groups:  10
Duplicate Range:          09-18
```

This historical structure is classified as:

```text
mixed-reorganization
```

---

## 15. Historical Reorganization

Repository history contains:

```text
4775299d0039a26051115a66ce4e7063c303c179
docs(epic-doc-001): reorganize Documentation Framework structure
```

dated:

```text
2026-08-06
```

This reorganization introduced substantial documentation content but resulted in a mixed numbered structure with duplicate numbering.

---

## 16. Historical Duplicate Groups

The mixed structure contained the following duplicate-number groups.

### 16.1 Number 09

```text
09-Documentation-Lifecycle.md
09-Documentation-Validation.md
```

### 16.2 Number 10

```text
10-Documentation-Automation.md
10-Documentation-Governance.md
```

### 16.3 Number 11

```text
11-Documentation-Generation.md
11-Documentation-Templates.md
```

### 16.4 Number 12

```text
12-Documentation-Automation.md
12-Documentation-Publishing.md
```

### 16.5 Number 13

```text
13-Documentation-Quality-Gates.md
13-Documentation-Traceability.md
```

### 16.6 Number 14

```text
14-Documentation-Quality.md
14-Documentation-Repository-Organization.md
```

### 16.7 Number 15

```text
15-Documentation-Governance.md
15-Documentation-Review-Process.md
```

### 16.8 Number 16

```text
16-Documentation-Maintenance.md
16-Documentation-Toolchain.md
```

### 16.9 Number 17

```text
17-Documentation-Migration-Strategy.md
17-Roadmap.md
```

### 16.10 Number 18

```text
18-Documentation-Deprecation-Policy.md
18-References.md
```

---

## 17. Duplicate Skeleton Classification

Repository audit showed that each duplicate group contained one substantive document and one short generic skeleton.

The generic skeleton documents followed a repeated structure similar to:

```text
Purpose
Objectives
Principles
Responsibilities
Validation
Summary
```

They did not provide the domain-specific depth of the substantive framework documents.

---

## 18. Removed Duplicate Skeleton Documents

The following files are excluded from the normalized canonical structure:

```text
09-Documentation-Validation.md
10-Documentation-Automation.md
11-Documentation-Generation.md
12-Documentation-Publishing.md
13-Documentation-Traceability.md
14-Documentation-Quality.md
15-Documentation-Governance.md
16-Documentation-Toolchain.md
17-Roadmap.md
18-References.md
```

---

## 19. Retained Substantive Documents

The canonical files retained from the duplicate-number range are:

```text
09-Documentation-Lifecycle.md
10-Documentation-Governance.md
11-Documentation-Templates.md
12-Documentation-Automation.md
13-Documentation-Quality-Gates.md
14-Documentation-Repository-Organization.md
15-Documentation-Review-Process.md
16-Documentation-Maintenance.md
17-Documentation-Migration-Strategy.md
18-Documentation-Deprecation-Policy.md
```

---

## 20. Structural Normalization

The normalization transforms the repository as follows:

```text
Historical State
----------------
33 numbered documents
7 control documents
40 total files
10 duplicate number groups
01-23 nominal range

        ↓

Remove 10 duplicate skeleton documents

        ↓

Intermediate State
------------------
23 numbered documents
7 control documents
30 files
01-23
0 duplicate groups

        ↓

Add 00-EPIC.md

        ↓

Canonical State
---------------
24 numbered documents
7 control documents
31 canonical files
00-23
0 duplicate groups
```

---

## 21. Documentation Lifecycle

Documentation SHALL progress through a controlled lifecycle.

A representative lifecycle is:

```text
Draft
  ↓
Review
  ↓
Validation
  ↓
Approval
  ↓
Publication
  ↓
Maintenance
  ↓
Revision
  ↓
Deprecation
  ↓
Archival
```

Lifecycle transitions SHALL preserve traceability.

---

## 22. Documentation Metadata

Canonical documentation SHOULD expose metadata appropriate to its role.

Potential metadata includes:

```text
Identifier
Title
Version
Status
Owner
Creation Date
Update Date
Related EPIC
Related RFC
Related ADR
Supersedes
Superseded By
```

Machine-readable formats MAY be used where beneficial.

---

## 23. Documentation Versioning

Documentation SHALL evolve through controlled versioning.

Versioning SHALL remain compatible with:

* repository history;
* document lifecycle;
* framework release governance;
* controlled evolution.

---

## 24. Documentation Governance

Documentation governance SHALL define:

* ownership;
* review responsibility;
* approval responsibility;
* validation responsibility;
* lifecycle management;
* change control;
* maintenance responsibility;
* migration authority;
* deprecation authority;
* exception handling.

Governance SHOULD be proportional to document importance and engineering impact.

---

## 25. Documentation Automation

The framework supports automation in areas such as:

* naming validation;
* structure validation;
* metadata validation;
* reference validation;
* repository inventory;
* document generation;
* quality gates;
* release validation.

Automation SHALL NOT replace engineering ownership or required review.

---

## 26. Documentation Quality Gates

Documentation SHOULD pass appropriate quality gates before becoming canonical.

Potential gates include:

```text
Structure
Naming
Metadata
References
Completeness
Consistency
Traceability
Semantic Alignment
Repository Integrity
```

---

## 27. Repository Organization

The framework recognizes documentation repository areas such as:

```text
docs/
├── adr/
├── rfcs/
├── epics/
├── specs/
├── architecture/
├── plugins/
├── guides/
├── reference/
└── templates/
```

The physical repository organization MAY evolve through controlled migration.

---

## 28. Documentation Review

Documentation review SHOULD evaluate:

* technical correctness;
* clarity;
* structural compliance;
* terminology;
* references;
* metadata;
* architectural alignment;
* ownership;
* maintainability.

Review rigor SHOULD be proportional to engineering impact.

---

## 29. Documentation Maintenance

Published documentation requires continued maintenance.

Maintenance may include:

* correcting outdated information;
* updating references;
* aligning terminology;
* reflecting implementation changes;
* updating ownership;
* correcting structural drift;
* reviewing deprecated material.

---

## 30. Documentation Migration

Documentation migration SHALL preserve engineering knowledge and traceability.

Representative migration model:

```text
Current State
    ↓
Migration Plan
    ↓
Controlled Transformation
    ↓
Validation
    ↓
Reference Update
    ↓
Historical Record
```

---

## 31. Documentation Deprecation

Deprecated documentation SHOULD clearly communicate:

* deprecation state;
* reason;
* replacement document where available;
* migration path where relevant.

Historical documentation MAY remain available where useful.

---

## 32. Documentation Metrics

Documentation metrics MAY be used to evaluate framework health.

Examples include:

* documentation coverage;
* structural compliance;
* metadata compliance;
* broken-reference count;
* review completion;
* stale-document count;
* validation success;
* maintenance activity.

Metrics SHALL support engineering judgment rather than replace it.

---

## 33. Validation Model

EPIC-DOC-001 SHALL be validated at multiple levels.

### Structural Validation

Validation SHALL verify:

* expected files;
* numbering integrity;
* naming consistency;
* control documents;
* duplicate-number absence;
* empty-file absence.

### Semantic Validation

Validation SHALL verify consistency between:

* architecture;
* standards;
* lifecycle;
* metadata;
* governance;
* automation;
* quality;
* maintenance;
* migration;
* deprecation;
* metrics;
* release requirements.

### Repository Validation

Repository validation SHALL verify compatibility with the current FamilyOS repository state.

### Release Validation

Release validation SHALL verify framework release evidence and release-readiness conditions.

---

## 34. Historical Release Declaration

The historical release document:

```text
22-Documentation-Framework-Release.md
```

declares:

```text
Documentation Framework
Version: 1.0.0
Status: released
Date: 2026-08-06
```

This constitutes documentary evidence of a framework release declaration.

---

## 35. Historical Git Release Investigation

Repository-history audit examined potential Git identities for the Documentation Framework.

No dedicated Documentation Framework Git tag was identified.

The following tags touched EPIC-DOC-001 repository history but were determined to belong to other release purposes:

```text
v3.5.0-documents-plugin
v4.2.0-adr-governance-consolidation
```

`v3.5.0-documents-plugin` resolves to:

```text
935865417f851f15fc617a56da8d5230c0361f41
```

and represents the Documents Plugin release.

`v4.2.0-adr-governance-consolidation` resolves to:

```text
e4ea9e239c9672c07808aa81432d555f9e84724c
```

and represents ADR governance consolidation.

Neither tag is authoritative for an EPIC-DOC-001 Documentation Framework release.

---

## 36. Historical Release Classification

The authoritative current classification is:

```text
Historical Release: DOCUMENTARY ONLY
```

Therefore:

```text
Dedicated Documentation Framework Tag:    None
Dedicated Historical Release Commit:      None
Historical Publication Model:             Documentary
Historical Git Release Identity:          Not Established
```

No Git tag or commit identity SHALL be invented.

---

## 37. Framework Version

The framework version remains:

```text
1.0.0
```

Structural normalization does not automatically require a framework semantic-version change.

---

## 38. Framework Lifecycle State

The current canonical framework lifecycle state is:

```text
Baseline
```

This reflects the established Documentation Framework `1.0.0` baseline.

---

## 39. Status Reconciliation

EPIC-DOC-001 distinguishes three different status dimensions.

### Framework Lifecycle State

```text
Baseline
```

This is the current canonical framework state.

---

### Historical Release State

```text
Released
```

This appears in `22-Documentation-Framework-Release.md` and represents documentary historical release evidence.

---

### Current Repository Validation State

```text
Validated
```

This describes the current repository evidence state.

These concepts SHALL NOT be treated as interchangeable.

---

## 40. Current Framework State

```text
EPIC:                       EPIC-DOC-001
Framework Version:          1.0.0
Framework Lifecycle State:  Baseline

Historical Release:         Documentary Only
Dedicated Framework Tag:    None
Dedicated Release Commit:   None

Canonical Range:            00-23
Numbered Documents:         24
Control Documents:           7
Canonical Files:            31

Repository Validation:      Validated
Final Revalidation:         Validated
Final Closure:              Closed
```

---

## 41. Framework Boundaries

EPIC-DOC-001 owns Documentation Framework semantics.

Related framework authorities remain:

| Domain                 | Authority    |
| ---------------------- | ------------ |
| Engineering Foundation | EPIC-ENG-001 |
| Testing                | EPIC-TST-001 |
| Quality                | EPIC-QLT-001 |
| Build                  | EPIC-BLD-001 |
| Release                | EPIC-REL-001 |
| Observability          | EPIC-OBS-001 |
| Security               | EPIC-SEC-001 |
| Operations             | EPIC-OPS-001 |
| Documentation          | EPIC-DOC-001 |

EPIC-DOC-001 defines how documentation for these domains is managed.

It does not replace their domain semantics.

---

## 42. Repository Quality Gates

Current repository validation SHALL include:

```text
ruff check .
mypy src
pytest -q
git diff --check
```

Actual execution results SHALL be recorded in `VALIDATION.md`.

---

## 43. Acceptance Criteria

EPIC-DOC-001 is structurally normalized when:

* canonical range is `00-23`;
* exactly 24 numbered documents exist;
* exactly seven control documents exist;
* exactly 31 canonical files exist;
* no numbering collisions remain;
* no numbered documents are missing;
* no canonical files are empty;
* duplicate skeleton documents are absent;
* `EPIC.yaml` parses successfully;
* `EPIC.yaml` matches the filesystem;
* `MANIFEST.md` matches the filesystem;
* `README.md` matches the canonical structure;
* historical release state is correctly classified;
* control documents are aligned;
* repository quality gates pass;
* final repository state is consistent.

---

## 44. Current Structural Evidence

The current normalization has established the target structure:

```text
Canonical Range:         00-23
Numbered Documents:      24
Control Documents:        7
Canonical Files:         31
Duplicate Number Groups:  0
```

The ten duplicate skeleton documents are excluded from the canonical filesystem.

---

## 45. Current Revalidation State

Current repository validation is:

```text
Repository Validation: Validated
Final Revalidation:    Validated
```

These states reflect the current repository validation evidence.

---

## 46. Closure Conditions

EPIC-DOC-001 reaches final validated closure when:

```text
Canonical Structure             PASS
Numbering Integrity             PASS
Duplicate Removal               PASS
Control Document Alignment      PASS
YAML Contract                   PASS
Filesystem Contract             PASS
Manifest Synchronization        PASS
Reference Validation            PASS
Placeholder Validation          PASS
Semantic Validation             PASS
Historical Release Resolution   PASS
Repository Quality Gates        PASS
Final Repository State          CLEAN
```

---

## 47. Definition of Done

EPIC-DOC-001 is considered fully normalized and revalidated when:

* the canonical structure is deterministic;
* duplicate skeletons have been removed;
* `00-EPIC.md` exists;
* all seven control documents are aligned;
* YAML metadata is valid;
* repository inventory is correct;
* historical release evidence is truthfully represented;
* no dedicated Documentation Framework Git release is falsely claimed;
* validation evidence is complete;
* repository quality gates pass;
* final repository state is clean;
* current framework state can be reconstructed from repository history.

---

## 48. Current Closure State

```text
Documentation Complete:            true
Structural Normalization Complete: true

Framework Lifecycle State:         Baseline
Historical Release:                Documentary Only

Control Documents Aligned:         true
Validation Passed:                 true
Final Commit Created:              true
Working Tree Clean:                true
EPIC Closed:                       true
```

---

## 49. Final Principle

EPIC-DOC-001 SHALL preserve both:

```text
what historically existed
```

and:

```text
what is canonically valid now
```

The Documentation Framework SHALL remain:

* structurally deterministic;
* semantically coherent;
* historically traceable;
* version controlled;
* evidence validated;
* compatible with FamilyOS engineering governance.

---

## 50. Summary

EPIC-DOC-001 establishes the canonical FamilyOS Documentation Framework.

It governs:

* documentation architecture;
* standards;
* lifecycle;
* templates;
* metadata;
* versioning;
* governance;
* automation;
* quality gates;
* repository organization;
* reviews;
* maintenance;
* migration;
* deprecation;
* metrics;
* validation;
* release.

The current normalization resolves the historical mixed repository structure by:

1. removing ten duplicate generic skeleton documents;
2. retaining substantive framework documents;
