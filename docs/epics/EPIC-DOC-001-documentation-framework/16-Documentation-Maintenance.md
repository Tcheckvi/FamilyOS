# Documentation Framework

## 16 Documentation Maintenance

### Context

Documentation maintenance ensures that FamilyOS documentation remains accurate, relevant, and useful throughout the evolution of the platform.

A document that is not maintained can become:

* outdated,
* misleading,
* inconsistent with implementation,
* difficult to use.

Documentation maintenance defines the practices required to preserve documentation quality after publication.

---

## Documentation Maintenance Principles

FamilyOS documentation maintenance follows these principles.

### Continuous Accuracy

Documentation must reflect the current state of the platform.

---

### Ownership Responsibility

Every official document must have an accountable owner.

---

### Proactive Updates

Documentation updates should happen when changes are introduced, not only after problems appear.

---

### Historical Preservation

Previous versions must remain available when documentation evolves.

---

## Maintenance Responsibilities

Documentation maintenance involves several roles.

## Document Owner Responsibilities

The document owner is responsible for:

* ensuring documentation remains relevant,
* approving major changes,
* assigning maintenance activities,
* monitoring documentation health.

---

## Maintainer Responsibilities

Maintainers are responsible for:

* reviewing updates,
* correcting outdated information,
* validating references,
* coordinating improvements.

---

## Contributor Responsibilities

Contributors should:

* report outdated information,
* propose improvements,
* update documentation related to their changes.

---

## Maintenance Triggers

Documentation maintenance is triggered by:

### Software Changes

Examples:

* new features,
* API changes,
* architecture changes,
* plugin updates.

---

### Specification Changes

Examples:

* updated requirements,
* modified constraints,
* new compatibility rules.

---

### Security Changes

Examples:

* policy updates,
* security model evolution,
* vulnerability corrections.

---

### User Feedback

Examples:

* unclear documentation,
* missing explanations,
* incorrect examples.

---

## Maintenance Activities

Maintenance includes:

### Content Updates

Updating information to match reality.

---

### Reference Updates

Checking:

* internal references,
* version references,
* related artifacts.

---

### Structure Updates

Applying:

* template improvements,
* formatting standards,
* repository changes.

---

### Quality Improvements

Improving:

* readability,
* examples,
* explanations,
* discoverability.

---

## Documentation Review Frequency

Documents should be reviewed according to importance.

Recommended frequency:

| Document Type          | Review Frequency             |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Architecture Documents | Regular review               |
| Specifications         | After related changes        |
| RFCs                   | During lifecycle transitions |
| Plugin Documentation   | With plugin releases         |
| Guides                 | When procedures change       |
| References             | Periodic review              |

---

## Documentation Freshness

Documentation freshness indicates how recently a document was reviewed.

Example metadata:

```yaml id="6l4n3k"
maintenance:
  last_reviewed: 2026-08-06
  next_review: 2026-11-06
```

---

## Documentation Debt Management

Documentation debt represents missing or outdated documentation.

Examples:

* undocumented features,
* outdated examples,
* broken references,
* missing migration notes.

---

### Documentation Debt Handling

Documentation debt should be:

* identified,
* tracked,
* prioritized,
* resolved.

---

## Maintenance Workflow

---

## Maintenance During Releases

Software releases must consider documentation impact.

Release preparation should verify:

* new features documented,
* changed behavior explained,
* migration information available.

---

## Deprecated Documentation Maintenance

Deprecated documents require maintenance until archival.

Required updates:

* replacement references,
* migration guidance,
* final status information.

---

## Documentation Health Metrics

Documentation quality can be measured through:

### Freshness

How recently documents were reviewed.

---

### Coverage

How much functionality is documented.

---

### Accuracy

How well documentation matches implementation.

---

### Usage

How frequently documentation is consulted.

---

## Automation Support

Future automation may assist maintenance through:

* stale document detection,
* broken reference detection,
* version mismatch detection,
* missing documentation alerts.

---

## Governance Integration

Documentation maintenance is governed by:

* Documentation Governance,
* Documentation Lifecycle,
* Documentation Quality Gates,
* Release Framework.

---

## Relationship With Other Frameworks

Documentation maintenance integrates with:

* Engineering Foundation,
* Quality Framework,
* Plugin Framework,
* Release Framework.

---

## Final Compliance

Documentation maintenance is compliant when:

* ownership exists,
* updates are controlled,
* outdated information is corrected,
* history is preserved,
* quality remains measurable.

Documentation maintenance ensures that FamilyOS documentation continues to provide reliable knowledge throughout the entire evolution of the platform.
