# Documentation Framework

## 03 Documentation Architecture

### Purpose

This document defines the official documentation architecture model for the
FamilyOS ecosystem.

The Documentation Architecture establishes how documentation artifacts are
structured, organized, related, governed, and maintained throughout the
lifecycle of the platform.

The objective is to create a scalable documentation system capable of
supporting the evolution of FamilyOS across multiple domains, plugins,
frameworks, specifications, and engineering initiatives.

---

## Context

FamilyOS is designed as a long-term engineering platform.

The platform contains multiple architectural layers:

- core frameworks;
- domain capabilities;
- official plugins;
- specifications;
- engineering processes;
- quality systems.

Each layer produces and consumes documentation.

Without a defined documentation architecture, the repository would gradually
develop inconsistent structures, duplicated knowledge, unclear ownership, and
weak traceability.

The Documentation Architecture provides the organizational model required to
maintain a coherent engineering knowledge ecosystem.

---

## Architecture Principles

The Documentation Architecture follows fundamental principles that guarantee
long-term maintainability.

### Clear Responsibility Separation

Every document type must have a clearly defined purpose.

Documents must not duplicate responsibilities owned by another document type.

Examples:

- ADRs explain architectural decisions.
- RFCs explain proposed solutions.
- Specifications define technical requirements.
- EPICs define engineering initiatives.


### Single Source of Truth

Each important concept should have one authoritative location.

Other documents should reference the authoritative source instead of creating
duplicate definitions.

This principle prevents information divergence and reduces maintenance cost.

---

### Traceability

Documentation artifacts must maintain relationships between engineering
activities.

Typical traceability flow:

```text
Vision
  |
  v
Architecture Decision Record
  |
  v
RFC
  |
  v
Specification
  |
  v
EPIC
  |
  v
Implementation
  |
  v
Tests
Evolution

Documentation architecture must evolve together with FamilyOS.

Changes must preserve:

compatibility;
discoverability;
historical context;
engineering traceability.
Documentation Architecture Model

The FamilyOS Documentation Architecture is organized into multiple layers.

Strategic Documentation Layer
Purpose

The Strategic Documentation Layer defines the long-term direction of the
FamilyOS platform.

It answers:

Why does the platform exist?
What objectives must be achieved?
Which capabilities should evolve?
Examples

Strategic documentation includes:

vision documents;
roadmap documents;
engineering strategy documents.
Architecture Decision Layer
Purpose

The Architecture Decision Layer records important technical decisions.

It explains:

what decision was made;
why the decision was required;
alternatives considered;
consequences.
Main Artifact

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).

Examples:

ADR-0007 — Official Plugins Architecture
ADR-0013 — Official Plugin Implementation Strategy


# Request for Comment Layer

## Purpose

RFC documents define proposed solutions before implementation.

RFCs provide a structured review mechanism.

They describe:

- problem context;
- goals;
- architecture proposal;
- public interfaces;
- implementation approach;
- validation strategy.

Examples:

- RFC-0010 — Security Plugin
- RFC-0015 — Communication Plugin

---

# Specification Layer

## Purpose

Specifications define precise engineering requirements.

They transform architectural decisions into technical contracts.

Specifications define:

- expected behavior;
- interfaces;
- constraints;
- compatibility requirements;
- validation rules.

Specifications should remain implementation-independent whenever possible.

---

# Engineering EPIC Layer

## Purpose

EPIC documentation organizes large engineering initiatives.

An EPIC defines:

- objectives;
- scope;
- dependencies;
- deliverables;
- acceptance criteria.

Examples:

- EPIC-ENG-001 — Engineering Foundation
- EPIC-DOC-001 — Documentation Framework

EPIC documents connect strategy with implementation work.

---

# Implementation Documentation Layer

## Purpose

Implementation documentation supports engineers during development and
maintenance.

Examples:

- developer guides;
- API documentation;
- integration documentation;
- operational references.

This layer explains how systems are built, integrated, and maintained.


# Reference Documentation Layer

## Purpose

Reference documentation provides stable shared information.

Examples:

- glossary;
- naming conventions;
- terminology;
- reserved words;
- indexes.

Reference documents ensure consistency across the ecosystem.

---

# Document Relationships

The documentation ecosystem follows a hierarchical relationship model.

```text
Strategic Documents
        |
        v
Architecture Decisions
        |
        v
RFC Documents
        |
        v

        |
        v
Engineering EPICs
        |
        v

        v
Source Code and Tests

Lower-level documents must remain consistent with higher-level decisions.

Repository Organization

Documentation must follow predictable repository organization.

Example:

docs/

├── adrs/

├── rfcs/

├── specifications/

├── epics/

├── guides/

└── reference/

Each directory represents a documentation responsibility.

Documentation Boundaries

Documentation boundaries prevent responsibility overlap.

ADR Boundary

Defines decisions.

Does not define complete implementation details.

RFC Boundary

Defines proposals.

Does not replace specifications.

Specification Boundary

Defines requirements.

Does not replace implementation documentation.

EPIC Boundary

Defines engineering initiatives.

Does not replace architectural decisions.
