# Documentation Framework

## 10 Documentation Governance

### Context

Documentation is a critical knowledge asset of the FamilyOS ecosystem.

As FamilyOS grows across multiple domains, plugins, specifications, and engineering processes, documentation requires governance to guarantee:

* consistency,
* ownership,
* quality,
* accountability,
* long-term sustainability.

Documentation governance defines the rules, responsibilities, decision processes, and controls required to maintain official FamilyOS documentation.

---

## Documentation Governance Principles

FamilyOS documentation governance follows these principles.

### Ownership

Every official document must have a clearly identified owner.

Ownership ensures:

* responsibility,
* maintenance continuity,
* decision accountability.

---

### Transparency

Documentation decisions must be visible and traceable.

All significant changes must be connected to:

* issues,
* RFCs,
* ADRs,
* EPICs,
* pull requests,
* releases.

---

### Consistency

All documentation must follow common standards:

* naming conventions,
* structure,
* terminology,
* formatting rules,
* versioning rules.

---

### Sustainability

Documentation must remain maintainable over the lifetime of FamilyOS.

Governance must prevent:

* duplicated information,
* outdated references,
* abandoned documentation,
* conflicting definitions.

---

## Documentation Governance Structure

FamilyOS documentation governance is organized into several responsibilities.

```text
Documentation Governance
          |
          +-- Documentation Owner
          |
          +-- Maintainers
          |
          +-- Reviewers
          |
          +-- Contributors
          |
          +-- Architecture Authority
```

---

## Governance Roles

### Documentation Owner

The Documentation Owner is responsible for the overall documentation ecosystem.

Responsibilities:

* maintain documentation standards,
* approve governance changes,
* ensure consistency,
* coordinate documentation evolution.

---

### Maintainers

Maintainers are responsible for specific documentation areas.

Examples:

* Plugin documentation,
* Architecture documentation,
* Specifications,
* Developer guides.

Responsibilities:

* review changes,
* maintain accuracy,
* handle lifecycle transitions.

---

### Reviewers

Reviewers validate documentation changes before approval.

Responsibilities:

* check technical accuracy,
* verify standards compliance,
* identify inconsistencies.

---

### Contributors

Contributors create and improve documentation.

Responsibilities:

* follow documentation standards,
* provide accurate information,
* maintain references.

---

### Architecture Authority

Architecture reviewers validate documents affecting:

* system architecture,
* domain boundaries,
* public interfaces,
* long-term technical decisions.

---

## Documentation Ownership Model

Each official document must define ownership metadata.

Example:

```yaml
document:
  owner: architecture-team
  maintainer: engineering-team
  reviewers:
    - documentation-team
```

---

## Documentation Change Governance

Documentation changes follow a controlled process.

```text
Create Change
      |
      v
Review
      |
      v
Validation
      |
      v
Approval
      |
      v
Publication
```

---

## Change Categories

### Editorial Changes

Examples:

* spelling corrections,
* formatting improvements,
* grammar fixes.

Approval:

* maintainer review.

---

### Informative Changes

Examples:

* additional explanations,
* examples,
* diagrams.

Approval:

* maintainer review.

---

### Normative Changes

Examples:

* architecture rules,
* specifications,
* public API documentation.

Approval:

* maintainer review,
* architecture review when required.

---

## Documentation Review Process

Documentation review evaluates:

### Structural Compliance

The document must follow:

* naming rules,
* required sections,
* metadata standards.

---

### Technical Accuracy

The content must:

* reflect implementation reality,
* avoid contradictions,
* use approved terminology.

---

### Reference Integrity

References must:

* exist,
* point to valid artifacts,
* identify versions when required.

---

## Documentation Decision Records

Important documentation governance decisions should be recorded.

Possible formats:

* ADR,
* RFC update,
* governance decision record.

Examples:

* changing documentation standards,
* introducing a new document category,
* modifying lifecycle rules.

---

## Governance Integration With Git

Git provides the audit history for documentation governance.

Required practices:

* meaningful commit messages,
* reviewed pull requests,
* preserved history,
* tagged releases.

Example:

```text
docs(framework): update documentation governance rules
```

---

## Documentation Governance Rules

The following rules are mandatory:

1. Official documentation must have ownership.
2. Unreviewed normative changes must not be published.
3. Documentation standards must be applied consistently.
4. Historical decisions must remain traceable.
5. Conflicting documentation must be resolved.
6. Deprecated documentation must follow lifecycle rules.

---

## Governance Metrics

Documentation quality may be measured through:

### Coverage

Measures whether required documentation exists.

---

### Freshness

Measures how recently documentation was reviewed.

---

### Consistency

Measures alignment between documentation sources.

---

### Traceability

Measures links between documentation and engineering artifacts.

---

## Governance Integration

Documentation governance integrates with:

* Engineering Governance,
* Quality Framework,
* Release Framework,
* Security Framework,
* Plugin Governance,
* Architecture Governance.

---

## Relationship With Other Documentation Framework Components

This governance model depends on:

* Documentation Standards,
* Documentation Versioning,
* Documentation Lifecycle,
* Documentation Quality Model.

---

## Final Compliance

Documentation governance is compliant when:

* responsibilities are defined,
* ownership is assigned,
* changes are controlled,
* reviews are performed,
* history is preserved.

Documentation governance ensures that FamilyOS documentation remains a trusted engineering foundation as the ecosystem evolves.
