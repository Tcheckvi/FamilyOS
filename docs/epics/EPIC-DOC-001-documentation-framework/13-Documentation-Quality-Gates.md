# Documentation Framework

## 13 Documentation Quality Gates

### Context

FamilyOS documentation is a critical engineering asset that supports architecture, development, governance, and ecosystem evolution.

As the platform grows, documentation must pass defined quality checkpoints before becoming official.

Documentation Quality Gates define the mandatory validation steps required to ensure documentation is:

* correct,
* complete,
* consistent,
* maintainable,
* reliable.

---

## Quality Gate Principles

FamilyOS documentation quality gates follow these principles.

### Prevention

Quality gates prevent defective documentation from becoming an official reference.

---

### Automation First

Whenever possible, validation should be automated.

Automation reduces:

* human error,
* inconsistent reviews,
* repetitive verification work.

---

### Human Validation

Automation cannot replace expert review.

Human validation remains required for:

* architecture decisions,
* normative content,
* security-sensitive documentation.

---

### Continuous Improvement

Quality gates evolve with:

* engineering practices,
* documentation standards,
* platform maturity.

---

## Documentation Quality Gate Model

FamilyOS defines the following quality gates:

```text
Documentation Created

        |
        v

Gate 1
Structure Validation

        |
        v

Gate 2
Content Validation

        |
        v

Gate 3
Technical Review

        |
        v

Gate 4
Governance Approval

        |
        v

Publication
```

---

## Gate 1 — Structure Validation

### Purpose

Ensure that the document follows approved documentation standards.

---

### Validation Criteria

The document must contain:

* correct file location,
* correct filename,
* required sections,
* valid Markdown structure,
* required metadata.

---

### Examples

Valid:

```text
docs/
 └── epics/
     └── EPIC-DOC-001/
         └── 13-Documentation-Quality-Gates.md
```

Invalid:

```text
random-folder/document.md
```

---

## Gate 2 — Content Validation

### Purpose

Verify documentation completeness and clarity.

---

### Validation Criteria

The document must:

* explain its purpose,
* define terminology,
* avoid contradictions,
* include required references,
* respect scope boundaries.

---

### Content Quality Checks

Reviewers verify:

* accuracy,
* readability,
* completeness,
* consistency.

---

## Gate 3 — Technical Review

### Purpose

Validate technical correctness.

---

### Required For

Technical review is required for documents related to:

* architecture,
* specifications,
* public APIs,
* plugins,
* security,
* data models.

---

### Review Criteria

Reviewers validate:

* alignment with implementation,
* architectural consistency,
* compatibility impact,
* future evolution.

---

## Gate 4 — Governance Approval

### Purpose

Confirm that documentation follows FamilyOS governance rules.

---

### Approval Criteria

The document must have:

* owner,
* lifecycle state,
* version,
* review history,
* related artifacts.

---

## Automated Quality Checks

The following checks should be automated.

### Markdown Validation

Checks:

* syntax,
* formatting,
* heading structure.

---

### Metadata Validation

Checks:

* required fields,
* valid values,
* version format.

---

### Reference Validation

Checks:

* document identifiers,
* links,
* artifact references.

---

### Template Validation

Checks:

* required sections,
* expected structure.

---

## Human Review Checklist

Reviewers should verify:

```text
□ Purpose is clear
□ Scope is defined
□ Terminology is consistent
□ References are valid
□ Architecture impact is considered
□ Versioning is correct
□ Lifecycle status is defined
```

---

## Quality Gate Failure Handling

When a document fails a quality gate:

The document must:

* remain in current lifecycle state,
* receive corrective changes,
* be reviewed again.

Failures must be visible and traceable.

---

## Quality Gate Status

Recommended status values:

```yaml
quality:
  structure: passed
  content: passed
  technical_review: passed
  governance: passed
```

---

## Integration With CI/CD

Documentation quality gates should run automatically during:

* pull requests,
* releases,
* documentation updates.

Example:

```yaml
documentation_quality:
  checks:
    - markdown
    - metadata
    - references
    - templates
```

---

## Integration With Quality Framework

Documentation Quality Gates are part of the wider FamilyOS Quality Framework.

They contribute to:

* engineering reliability,
* maintainability,
* compliance,
* ecosystem trust.

---

## Governance Rules

The following rules apply:

1. Official documentation must pass required quality gates.
2. Failed validation must block publication when applicable.
3. Quality results must be traceable.
4. Quality criteria must evolve with platform needs.
5. Exceptions require documented approval.

---

## Relationship With Other Frameworks

Documentation Quality Gates integrate with:

* Documentation Standards,
* Documentation Templates,
* Documentation Automation,
* Documentation Governance,
* Quality Framework,
* Release Framework.

---

## Final Compliance

Documentation quality gates are compliant when:

* validation criteria are defined,
* automation is available,
* human review is performed when required,
* failures are controlled,
* publication quality is guaranteed.

Quality gates ensure that FamilyOS documentation remains a dependable foundation for long-term engineering evolution.
