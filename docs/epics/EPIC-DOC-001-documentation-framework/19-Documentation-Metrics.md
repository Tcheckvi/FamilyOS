# Documentation Framework

## 19 Documentation Metrics

### Context

Documentation quality must be measurable to ensure continuous improvement.

As FamilyOS grows, documentation requires objective indicators to evaluate:

* completeness,
* freshness,
* reliability,
* maintainability,
* governance compliance.

Documentation Metrics define the measurements used to monitor the health of the FamilyOS documentation ecosystem.

---

## Documentation Metrics Principles

FamilyOS documentation metrics follow these principles.

### Measurability

Metrics must provide objective information.

---

### Actionability

Metrics must help identify improvement opportunities.

---

### Transparency

Metric definitions must be documented and understandable.

---

### Continuous Improvement

Metrics should support long-term documentation quality evolution.

---

## Documentation Health Model

FamilyOS documentation health is evaluated through:

```text id="v8z6bw"
Documentation Health

├── Coverage
├── Freshness
├── Quality
├── Consistency
├── Traceability
└── Maintenance
```

---

## Documentation Coverage

### Purpose

Measures whether required documentation exists.

---

### Examples

Coverage may evaluate:

* documented features,
* documented plugins,
* documented specifications,
* documented APIs.

---

### Example Metric

```text id="t7z8n4"
Documentation Coverage =

Documented Items / Required Items × 100
```

---

## Documentation Freshness

### Purpose

Measures whether documentation is regularly reviewed.

---

### Indicators

Examples:

* last review date,
* age since last update,
* outdated document count.

---

### Example

```yaml id="m6f4zy"
freshness:
  last_reviewed: 2026-08-06
  status: current
```

---

## Documentation Quality

### Purpose

Measures documentation reliability.

---

### Quality Indicators

Examples:

* passed quality gates,
* review results,
* validation status.

---

### Example Metric

```text id="q2h7sv"
Quality Score =

Passed Checks / Total Checks × 100
```

---

## Documentation Consistency

### Purpose

Measures alignment between documentation sources.

---

### Indicators

Examples:

* duplicate definitions,
* terminology conflicts,
* contradictory references.

---

## Documentation Traceability

### Purpose

Measures the relationship between documentation and engineering artifacts.

---

### Traceability Links

Examples:

```text id="a9x3ld"
Documentation

    |

    +-- RFC

    |

    +-- ADR

    |

    +-- SPEC

    |

    +-- EPIC
```

---

### Example Metric

```text id="9h4q8p"
Traceability Rate =

Linked Documents / Total Documents × 100
```

---

## Documentation Maintenance Metrics

### Purpose

Measures maintenance efficiency.

---

### Indicators

Examples:

* unresolved documentation issues,
* update frequency,
* review delays.

---

## Documentation Debt Metrics

### Purpose

Measures accumulated documentation problems.

---

### Documentation Debt Examples

* missing documents,
* outdated content,
* broken references,
* incomplete migration notes.

---

### Example Metric

```text id="3w9p2m"
Documentation Debt Count =
Number of Known Documentation Issues
```

---

## Documentation Review Metrics

Metrics related to review activities:

### Review Coverage

Percentage of documents reviewed.

---

### Review Duration

Time required for approval.

---

### Review Findings

Number of detected issues.

---

## Documentation Automation Metrics

Automation effectiveness may be measured through:

### Validation Success Rate

Percentage of successful automated checks.

---

### Automation Coverage

Percentage of documents validated automatically.

---

### Failure Resolution Time

Time needed to resolve validation failures.

---

## Documentation Dashboard

Future FamilyOS tooling may provide a documentation dashboard.

Example:

```text id="d4f7qy"
Documentation Health Dashboard

Coverage:        95%
Freshness:       90%
Quality Gates:   100%
Traceability:    85%
Debt:            12 items
```

---

## Metric Collection

Metrics may be collected from:

* Git history,
* documentation metadata,
* CI/CD results,
* review systems,
* validation tools.

---

## Metric Ownership

Responsibilities:

| Role                | Responsibility                      |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Documentation Owner | Defines metrics                     |
| Maintainers         | Monitor health                      |
| Quality Team        | Validates measurement               |
| Architects          | Review architecture-related metrics |

---

## Metric Evolution

Metrics evolve with FamilyOS maturity.

Changes require:

* documentation,
* review,
* governance approval.

---

## Governance Integration

Documentation metrics support:

* Documentation Governance,
* Quality Framework,
* Release Framework,
* Engineering Foundation.

---

## Relationship With Other Frameworks

Documentation Metrics integrate with:

* Documentation Quality Gates,
* Documentation Automation,
* Documentation Maintenance,
* Documentation Lifecycle.

---

## Final Compliance

Documentation metrics are compliant when:

* measurements are defined,
* results are actionable,
* ownership exists,
* trends can be monitored,
* improvements are measurable.

Documentation metrics provide visibility into the health and evolution of the FamilyOS knowledge ecosystem.
