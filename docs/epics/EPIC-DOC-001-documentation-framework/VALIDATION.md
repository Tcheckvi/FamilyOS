## 1. Purpose

This document defines and records the validation contract for:

```text
EPIC-DOC-001 — Documentation Framework
```

Validation covers:

* canonical repository structure;
* numbered-document integrity;
* control-document integrity;
* duplicate-number elimination;
* filesystem consistency;
* YAML consistency;
* manifest alignment;
* README alignment;
* EPIC alignment;
* changelog alignment;
* revision-history alignment;
* reference integrity;
* placeholder integrity;
* documentation semantic consistency;
* framework-boundary consistency;
* historical release evidence;
* repository quality gates;
* final repository state.

Validation SHALL remain evidence-based.

A requirement SHALL NOT be marked `PASS` merely because it is documented.

---

## 2. Validation Principle

The canonical validation model is:

```text
Execute
   ↓
Observe
   ↓
Evaluate
   ↓
Record
```

The prohibited model is:

```text
Requirement Exists
   ↓
Assume Success
   ↓
Record PASS
```

Every final `PASS` state SHALL correspond to current observable evidence.

---

## 3. Framework Identity

Expected framework identity:

```text
EPIC ID:             EPIC-DOC-001
Title:               Documentation Framework
Version:             1.0.0
Framework Status:    Baseline
```

Current result:

```text
Framework Identity: PENDING
```

---

## 4. Canonical Structure

The normalized canonical structure is expected to be:

```text
Canonical Range:       00-23
Numbered Documents:    24
Control Documents:      7
Canonical Files:       31
Duplicate Groups:       0
Missing Numbers:        0
```

Current result:

```text
Canonical Structure: PENDING
```

---

## 5. Canonical Numbered Documents

```

---

## 27. Reference Integrity

Active local Markdown references SHOULD resolve to existing canonical files.

Validation SHALL distinguish:

Removed Skeleton Reference Classification: PENDING
```

---

FIXME
XXX
TO BE DEFINED
TO BE COMPLETED
```

Occurrences SHALL be classified contextually.

Non-blocking examples may include:

* test examples.

Only unresolved active placeholders SHALL fail validation.

Current result:

```text
Placeholder Validation: PENDING
```

---

## 30. Duplicate Skeleton Semantic Classification

The ten removed skeleton files were classified as generic scaffolding because they used a repeated generic content structure and lacked substantive domain-specific definitions.

Validation SHALL preserve evidence of this classification.

Current result:

```text
Duplicate Skeleton Semantic Classification: PENDING
```

---

## 31. Documentation Principle Consistency

The framework SHALL preserve the following core principles:

```text
Documentation Is an Engineering Artifact

├── adr/
├── rfcs/
├── epics/
├── specs/
├── architecture/
├── plugins/
├── guides/
├── reference/
└── templates/
```

Current repository existence of every category SHALL be validated separately from conceptual framework definition.

Current result:

---

## 47. Framework Summary Consistency

`21-Documentation-Framework-Summary.md` SHALL describe the same conceptual framework preserved by current normalization.

Current result:

```text
Framework Summary Consistency: PENDING
```

---

## 48. Framework Release Declaration

`22-Documentation-Framework-Release.md` currently declares:

```yaml
release:
  name: Documentation Framework
  version: 1.0.0
  status: released
  date: 2026-08-06
```

This SHALL be treated as documentary release evidence.

Current result:

```text
Release Declaration Evidence: PRESENT
```

---

## 49. Historical Git Release Evidence

The current control contract does not yet contain a verified historical Git tag and commit.

Fields remain:

```text
historical_tag: pending_discovery
historical_commit: pending_discovery
publication_status: pending_historical_verification
```

Current result:

```text
Historical Git Release Evidence: PENDING
```

---

## 50. Historical Release Verification Requirements

Validation SHALL determine:

1. whether an official Documentation Framework tag exists;
2. which commit it resolves to;
3. whether the authoritative remote exposes the same tag;
4. whether that tag corresponds to version `1.0.0`;
5. whether publication should be considered historical and immutable.

Current result:

```text
Historical Release Verification: PENDING
```

---

## 51. Historical Tag Integrity

If a historical tag is found, its commit identity SHALL be recorded.

Subsequent normalization SHALL NOT move the tag.

Required relationship:

```text
historical release commit
!=
normalization commit
```

unless repository history proves otherwise for a specific reason.

Current result:

```text
Historical Tag Integrity: NOT YET APPLICABLE
```

---

## 52. Framework Version Integrity

Current framework version remains:

```text
1.0.0
```

Structural normalization alone SHALL NOT silently introduce a new framework version.

Current result:

```text
Framework Version Integrity: PENDING
```

---

## 53. Framework Status Integrity

Current control metadata uses:

```text
status: baseline
```

while historical `EPIC-DOC-001.md` text includes:

```text
Status: In Progress
```

and release documentation declares:

```text
status: released
```

These states represent a current semantic inconsistency requiring explicit reconciliation.

Current result:

```text
Framework Status Integrity: PENDING
```

---

## 54. Status Reconciliation Requirement

Validation SHALL distinguish:

* historical authoring state;
* framework release declaration;
* current control lifecycle state;
* repository validation state.

The following SHALL NOT be treated as interchangeable:

```text
In Progress
Released
Baseline
Validated
Completed
```

Current result:

```text
Status Reconciliation: PENDING
```

---

Current result:

```text
Documentation / Observability Boundary: PENDING
```

---

## 70. Structural Validation Target

The expected structural result is:

```text
Canonical Range:         00-23
Numbered Documents:      24
Control Documents:        7
Canonical Files:         31
Duplicate Number Groups:  0
Missing Numbers:          0
Empty Canonical Files:    0
```

---

## 71. Filesystem Validation Target

Expected final inventory:

```text
declared:   31
actual:     31
missing:    []
unexpected: []
```

---

## 72. Removed Skeleton Validation Target

Expected result:

```text
removed duplicate skeletons present: []
```

---

## 73. Quality Gate Target

Required final result:

```text
Ruff:      0
MyPy:      0
Pytest:    0
DiffCheck: 0
```

Actual execution evidence SHALL determine the final result.

---

## 74. Historical Release Target

Historical release verification SHALL produce either:

```text
Historical Release: VERIFIED
```

with identified Git evidence,

or:

```text
Historical Release: DOCUMENTARY ONLY
```

if repository history does not support an official Git release identity.

The result SHALL be based on evidence rather than assumption.

---

## 75. Current Validation Decision

Current state:

```text
EPIC:                   EPIC-DOC-001
Version:                1.0.0
Framework Status:       Baseline

Canonical Range:        00-23
Numbered Documents:     24
Control Documents:       7
Canonical Files:        31

Current Activity:
Structural Normalization and Revalidation

Repository Validation: Validated
Final Revalidation:    Validated
Historical Git State:  Documentary Only
```

Therefore:

```text
EPIC-DOC-001 REVALIDATION: PASS
```

---

## 76. Final Validation Result

Current result:

```text
PASS
```

The final result SHALL become `PASS` only after:

* canonical structure is confirmed;
* filesystem matches metadata;
* duplicate skeletons are absent;
* all control documents are aligned;
* status semantics are reconciled;
* historical release evidence is resolved;
* references are validated;
* placeholders are classified;
* framework semantics remain coherent;
* repository quality gates pass;
* remote state is verified where required;
* final repository state is clean.

---

## 77. Final Principle

EPIC-DOC-001 SHALL not be considered finally revalidated merely because its documentation is extensive.

The normalized Documentation Framework becomes trustworthy only when:

```text
Structure
+
Semantic Consistency
+
Historical Integrity
+
Repository Evidence
+
Quality Gates
+
Clean Final State
=
Validated Documentation Framework
```
