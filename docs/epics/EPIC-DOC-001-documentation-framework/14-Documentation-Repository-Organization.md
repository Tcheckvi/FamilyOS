# Documentation Framework

## 14 Documentation Repository Organization

### Context

The FamilyOS documentation repository is a structured knowledge system that contains architectural decisions, specifications, engineering processes, plugin documentation, and operational references.

As the ecosystem grows, documentation organization must remain predictable and scalable.

The Documentation Repository Organization defines the official structure, placement rules, and management principles for all documentation artifacts.

---

## Repository Organization Principles

FamilyOS documentation organization follows these principles.

### Discoverability

Every document must have a predictable location.

Contributors should be able to find documentation without searching through unrelated directories.

---

### Separation of Concerns

Different documentation categories must remain separated.

Examples:

* architecture decisions,
* technical specifications,
* implementation documentation,
* operational guides.

---

### Scalability

The repository structure must support future growth:

* more plugins,
* more domains,
* more specifications,
* more contributors.

---

### Automation Compatibility

The structure must support:

* indexing,
* validation,
* documentation generation,
* quality checks.

---

## Official Documentation Root

The documentation root directory is:

```text
docs/
```

All official FamilyOS documentation must be stored under this directory.

---

## Top-Level Documentation Structure

Recommended structure:

```text
docs/

├── adr/
├── rfcs/
├── epics/
├── specs/
├── architecture/
├── guides/
├── plugins/
├── reference/
├── templates/
└── README.md
```

---

## ADR Organization

Architecture Decision Records are stored under:

```text
docs/adr/
```

Structure:

```text
docs/
└── adr/
    ├── ADR-0001-title.md
    ├── ADR-0002-title.md
    └── ADR-0007-official-plugin-architecture.md
```

Rules:

* one ADR per decision,
* immutable history,
* numbered identifiers.

---

## RFC Organization

Request For Comments documents are stored under:

```text
docs/rfcs/
```

Structure:

```text
docs/
└── rfcs/
    └── RFC-0015-official-communication-plugin/
        ├── README.md
        ├── 00-RFC.md
        ├── 01-Context.md
        ├── 02-Goals.md
        └── 06-Validation.md
```

Rules:

* RFCs may contain multiple related documents,
* numbering must remain stable,
* lifecycle must be tracked.

---

## EPIC Organization

Large engineering initiatives are stored under:

```text
docs/epics/
```

Structure:

```text
docs/
└── epics/
    └── EPIC-DOC-001-documentation-framework/
        ├── README.md
        ├── 01-Introduction.md
        ├── 02-Vision.md
        ├── 03-Architecture.md
        └── ...
```

Rules:

* one directory per EPIC,
* ordered document numbering,
* complete lifecycle documentation.

---

## SPEC Organization

Specifications are stored under:

```text
docs/06-specifications/
```

Structure:

```text
docs/
└── specs/
    ├── SPEC-0001-documentation-structure/
    ├── SPEC-0002-identifier/
    └── SPEC-0005-document-format/
```

Rules:

* specifications are normative,
* versions must be explicit,
* historical versions must be preserved.

---

## Architecture Documentation

Architecture documentation is stored under:

```text
docs/architecture/
```

Examples:

```text
docs/
└── architecture/
    ├── system-overview.md
    ├── domain-model.md
    ├── plugin-architecture.md
    └── security-architecture.md
```

---

## Plugin Documentation Organization

Plugin documentation follows the plugin ecosystem structure.

Recommended:

```text
docs/
└── plugins/
    ├── security/
    ├── health/
    ├── finance/
    ├── education/
    ├── documents/
    └── communication/
```

Each plugin documentation directory may contain:

```text
README.md
Architecture.md
API.md
Configuration.md
Validation.md
```

---

## Template Organization

Documentation templates are stored under:

```text
docs/templates/
```

Structure:

```text
docs/
└── templates/
    ├── adr/
    ├── rfc/
    ├── epic/
    ├── spec/
    └── plugin/
```

Templates are version controlled.

---

## Reference Documentation

Stable reference information is stored under:

```text
docs/reference/
```

Examples:

* terminology,
* conventions,
* glossary,
* common definitions.

---

## Naming Rules

Documentation filenames must:

* use English,
* use PascalCase or kebab-case consistently,
* include identifiers when required.

Examples:

Correct:

```text
ADR-0007-official-plugin-architecture.md
```

Incorrect:

```text
my_architecture_notes.md
```

---

## Directory Naming Rules

Directories must:

* describe their content,
* avoid ambiguous names,
* remain stable over time.

Example:

Correct:

```text
EPIC-DOC-001-documentation-framework
```

Incorrect:

```text
documentation-final-version
```

---

## Documentation Indexing

The repository should provide indexes:

Examples:

```text
docs/
├── README.md
├── ADR-INDEX.md
├── RFC-INDEX.md
├── EPIC-INDEX.md
└── SPEC-INDEX.md
```

Indexes may be generated automatically.

---

## Git Integration

Documentation organization relies on Git capabilities:

* history tracking,
* version comparison,
* release tagging,
* review workflow.

Documentation moves must preserve history.

---

## Repository Validation Rules

Automation should verify:

* expected directories exist,
* identifiers are valid,
* filenames follow conventions,
* documents are correctly placed.

---

## Governance Integration

Repository organization is managed through:

* Documentation Governance,
* Documentation Standards,
* Documentation Templates,
* Quality Framework.

---

## Relationship With Other Frameworks

Documentation repository organization integrates with:

* Engineering Foundation,
* Build Framework,
* Release Framework,
* Quality Framework,
* Plugin Framework.

---

## Final Compliance

Documentation repository organization is compliant when:

* every document has a defined location,
* categories are separated,
* naming rules are respected,
* automation can process the structure,
* documentation remains discoverable.

A consistent repository structure allows FamilyOS documentation to scale from a single project into a complete engineering ecosystem.
