# Documentation Framework

## 04 Documentation Standards

### Context

Documentation is a fundamental engineering asset within the FamilyOS ecosystem.

The Documentation Standards define the rules, structures, conventions, and quality expectations applied to all official FamilyOS documentation.

These standards ensure that documentation remains:

- understandable,
- consistent,
- traceable,
- maintainable,
- scalable.

Documentation is considered part of the platform architecture and follows controlled lifecycle management.

### Documentation Standard Principles

#### Purpose of Documentation Standards

Documentation standards define the common rules, structures, and expectations that govern all FamilyOS documentation.

The objective is to ensure that every document produced within the FamilyOS ecosystem is:

- understandable by humans,
- usable by engineering teams,
- traceable across versions,
- consistent across domains,
- maintainable over time,
- suitable for long-term knowledge preservation.

Documentation is treated as a first-class engineering artifact.

It is not an activity performed after implementation, but an integrated component of the FamilyOS engineering lifecycle.

### Documentation as an Engineering Artifact

Documentation follows the same engineering principles applied to software components.

Every documentation artifact MUST have:

- a clear purpose,
- an ownership context,
- a defined structure,
- a controlled lifecycle,
- traceable relationships,
- validation criteria.

Documentation artifacts MUST be maintained as evolving products.

### Core Documentation Principles

#### Principle 1 — Clarity First

Documentation MUST prioritize clarity over complexity.

Authors SHOULD:

- use precise terminology,
- explain concepts progressively,
- structure information logically,
- avoid unnecessary ambiguity.

Documentation MUST allow contributors to understand a concept without requiring undocumented historical knowledge.

#### Principle 2 — Single Source of Truth

Each concept SHOULD have one authoritative documentation location.

Duplicated definitions create:

- inconsistent interpretations,
- maintenance overhead,
- conflicting information.

When information is reused, documents SHOULD reference the canonical source.

#### Principle 3 — Separation of Concerns

Documentation MUST respect separation of responsibilities.

Each document type has a specific purpose.

Examples:

Architecture documents:

- describe system structure,
- explain design decisions,
- define boundaries.

Specifications:

- define requirements,
- describe constraints,
- establish contracts.

Implementation documentation:

- explains technical realization,
- describes operational details.

Guides:

- explain usage procedures.

Mixing these responsibilities reduces documentation quality.

#### Principle 4 — Evolution Through Controlled Change

Documentation MUST evolve with the FamilyOS platform.

Changes SHOULD be:

- intentional,
- reviewed,
- traceable,
- compatible.

Major documentation changes SHOULD include:

- revision information,
- impact assessment,
- migration guidance when required.

## Documentation Quality Model

### Accuracy

Documentation MUST represent the current state of the system.

Incorrect information reduces trust and MUST be corrected.

### Completeness

Documentation MUST contain sufficient information to achieve its intended purpose.

Completeness does not mean unnecessary length.

A document is complete when required information is available and understandable.

### Consistency

Documentation MUST maintain consistency across:

- terminology,
- formatting,
- naming,
- references,
- structure.

### Maintainability

Documentation SHOULD remain easy to update.

Maintainable documentation:

- avoids unnecessary duplication,
- uses stable references,
- follows predictable structures.

### Accessibility

Documentation SHOULD be understandable by its intended audience.

Technical depth MUST match the document purpose.

## Documentation Audience Levels

### Users

User documentation focuses on:

- explanations,
- workflows,
- expected behavior,
- practical guidance.

### Contributors

Contributor documentation provides:

- architecture context,
- development rules,
- extension mechanisms,
- contribution procedures.

### Maintainers

Maintainer documentation provides:

- governance information,
- lifecycle rules,
- compatibility considerations,
- operational knowledge.

### Architects

Architecture documentation provides:

- design principles,
- system boundaries,
- evolution strategies,
- architectural decisions.

## Documentation Lifecycle Integration

Documentation activities are integrated into the FamilyOS engineering workflow.

A feature, plugin, RFC, ADR, or specification is not complete until required documentation artifacts are available.

The documentation lifecycle includes:

1. Planning
2. Creation
3. Review
4. Validation
5. Publication
6. Maintenance
7. Evolution

## Language Standards

### Official Documentation Language

The official language of FamilyOS documentation is English.

All normative documentation MUST be written in English.

This includes:

- RFC documents,
- ADR documents,
- EPIC documents,
- specifications,
- architecture documentation,
- API documentation,
- engineering standards.

### Language Consistency

FamilyOS documentation MUST use stable terminology.

The same concept MUST NOT be described using different names unless the distinction is intentional.

Preferred terms:

- Plugin
- Plugin Runtime
- Plugin Capability
- Contribution
- Specification
- Architecture Decision Record

### Technical Writing Style

Documentation MUST use professional technical language.

Documentation SHOULD be:

- precise,
- objective,
- structured,
- explicit.

Documentation MUST avoid:

- marketing language,
- emotional wording,
- personal opinions,
- ambiguous expressions.

### Requirement Language

The following normative terms are used:

#### MUST

Mandatory requirement.

#### MUST NOT

Forbidden behavior.

#### SHOULD

Recommended practice.

#### SHOULD NOT

Practice generally discouraged.

#### MAY

Optional capability.

## Markdown Standards

### General Rules

All FamilyOS documentation MUST use Markdown.

Markdown files MUST:

- use UTF-8 encoding,
- use LF line endings,
- remain human-readable,
- support repository-based review.

### Heading Rules

Documents MUST contain:

- one level-one heading,
- correctly ordered heading levels,
- descriptive section names.

Heading levels MUST NOT be skipped.

### Code Blocks

Code examples MUST:

- use fenced blocks,
- specify language when possible,
- remain minimal.

### Tables

Tables SHOULD be used for structured information.

Tables SHOULD NOT replace explanations.

### References

References MUST be:

- accurate,
- relevant,
- maintained.

Broken references MUST be corrected.

## Naming Conventions

### General Rules

Documentation names MUST be:

- unique,
- predictable,
- descriptive.

### Identifier Format

FamilyOS identifiers use:

TYPE-NUMBER

Examples:

- RFC-0015
- ADR-0007
- SPEC-0005
- EPIC-DOC-001

Identifiers MUST never be reused.

### File Naming

Documentation files MUST use:

- lowercase names,
- hyphen separation,
- Markdown extension.

Example:

architecture-overview.md

Incorrect:

ArchitectureOverview.md

## Formatting Rules

Documentation formatting MUST prioritize:

- readability,
- consistency,
- simplicity.

Authors SHOULD use:

- clear headings,
- structured lists,
- meaningful examples.

Authors SHOULD avoid:

- decorative formatting,
- unnecessary complexity,
- inconsistent layouts.

## Governance Integration

Documentation governance ensures alignment with FamilyOS engineering principles.

Documentation changes SHOULD follow review practices similar to software changes.

Reviews SHOULD verify:

- correctness,
- compliance,
- terminology,
- references.

## Relationship With Other Frameworks

Documentation Standards integrate with:

- Engineering Framework,
- Testing Framework,
- Quality Framework,
- Build Framework,
- Release Framework.

Documentation quality contributes directly to overall FamilyOS quality.

## Final Compliance

A FamilyOS documentation artifact complies with these standards when it:

- follows required structure,
- uses approved terminology,
- respects naming conventions,
- follows Markdown rules,
- maintains valid references,
- passes validation checks.

Documentation Standards evolve together with the FamilyOS ecosystem.
