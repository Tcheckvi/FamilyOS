# Documentation Framework

## 17 Documentation Migration Strategy

### Context

FamilyOS documentation will evolve continuously as the platform grows.

Changes in:

* documentation standards,
* repository structure,
* templates,
* specifications,
* terminology,
* engineering processes,

may require existing documentation to be migrated.

The Documentation Migration Strategy defines how documentation transitions are planned, executed, validated, and recorded.

---

## Documentation Migration Principles

FamilyOS documentation migration follows these principles.

### Preservation

Existing knowledge must not be lost during migration.

Historical information must remain accessible.

---

### Controlled Evolution

Documentation migrations must be planned and reviewed.

Uncontrolled large-scale changes are discouraged.

---

### Traceability

Every migration must identify:

* source documentation,
* target documentation,
* migration reason,
* migration version.

---

### Compatibility

Migration activities must consider:

* existing references,
* contributors,
* automation tools,
* external consumers.

---

## Migration Types

FamilyOS defines several migration categories.

```text id="2h5a0n"
Documentation Migration

├── Structure Migration
├── Format Migration
├── Content Migration
├── Repository Migration
└── Version Migration
```

---

## Structure Migration

### Purpose

Structure migration changes the organization of documentation.

Examples:

* moving documents to new directories,
* introducing new categories,
* reorganizing EPIC structures.

---

### Requirements

Structure migrations must:

* preserve Git history,
* update references,
* update indexes,
* validate paths.

---

## Format Migration

### Purpose

Format migration updates documentation standards.

Examples:

* new templates,
* new metadata format,
* improved Markdown rules.

---

### Requirements

Format migrations must define:

* old format,
* new format,
* transformation rules,
* validation process.

---

## Content Migration

### Purpose

Content migration improves or restructures information.

Examples:

* splitting large documents,
* merging duplicate information,
* rewriting obsolete explanations.

---

### Requirements

Content migrations must preserve:

* original meaning,
* references,
* historical context.

---

## Repository Migration

### Purpose

Repository migration changes documentation locations.

Examples:

```text id="4r5u9k"
docs/old-location/

        |

        v

docs/new-location/
```

---

### Repository Migration Rules

Required actions:

* update links,
* update automation rules,
* verify indexes,
* maintain history.

---

## Version Migration

### Purpose

Version migration manages documentation version evolution.

Examples:

```text id="j8w0z5"
Documentation v1.x

        |

        v

Documentation v2.x
```

---

### Version Migration Requirements

Major migrations require:

* migration notes,
* compatibility explanation,
* affected document list.

---

## Migration Planning Process

```

---

## Migration Plan Requirements

Every migration plan should define:

```yaml id="p3x1wy"
migration:
  source_version: 1.x
  target_version: 2.x
  reason: "New documentation structure"
  owner: documentation-team
```

---

## Impact Analysis

Before migration, evaluate:

### Internal Impact

Affected:

* documents,
* references,
* templates,
* automation.

---

### External Impact

Affected:

* contributors,
* integrations,
* published references.

---

## Breaking Documentation Changes

A breaking documentation change occurs when users can no longer rely on previous structures or meanings.

Examples:

* removed specifications,
* renamed identifiers,
* changed normative requirements.

---

### Breaking Change Requirements

Breaking migrations require:

* major version update,
* migration documentation,
* approval.

---

## Migration Validation

After migration, validation must confirm:

* documents are accessible,
* references work,
* metadata is correct,
* versions are updated,
* history is preserved.

---

## Migration Records

Each migration should create a record.

Example:

```markdown id="q8m2br"
Migration:

From:
Documentation Framework v1

To:
Documentation Framework v2

Reason:
New repository organization

Date:
YYYY-MM-DD
```

---

## Automation Support

Future automation may assist migration through:

* document transformation,
* reference updates,
* metadata conversion,
* migration validation.

---

## Governance Integration

Documentation migrations are governed by:

* Documentation Governance,
* Documentation Versioning,
* Documentation Lifecycle,
* Quality Framework.

---

## Relationship With Other Frameworks

Documentation Migration Strategy integrates with:

* Engineering Foundation,
* Release Framework,
* Repository Organization,
* Template Management.

---

## Final Compliance

Documentation migration is compliant when:

* migration goals are defined,
* impact is analyzed,
* changes are traceable,
* validation is performed,
* historical information is preserved.

The Documentation Migration Strategy ensures that FamilyOS documentation can evolve without losing reliability, continuity, or accumulated knowledge.
