# Documentation Framework

# 05 Documentation Lifecycle

## Purpose

The Documentation Lifecycle defines the complete lifecycle management process applied to FamilyOS documentation artifacts.

The lifecycle ensures that documentation remains:

- accurate,
- reliable,
- traceable,
- maintainable,
- aligned with platform evolution.

Documentation lifecycle management treats documentation as a continuously evolving engineering asset.

## Lifecycle Overview

Every official FamilyOS documentation artifact follows a controlled lifecycle:

1. Planning
2. Creation
3. Review
4. Validation
5. Publication
6. Maintenance
7. Evolution
8. Retirement

Each lifecycle stage defines expected activities and quality requirements.

# Planning Phase

## Purpose

The planning phase identifies documentation requirements before creation begins.

Planning ensures that documentation work is aligned with:

- engineering objectives,
- architectural decisions,
- implementation activities,
- release expectations.

## Planning Activities

Planning SHOULD define:

- document type,
- document owner,
- target audience,
- expected structure,
- dependencies,
- validation requirements.

## Planning Outputs

The planning phase produces:

- documentation scope,
- required artifacts,
- delivery expectations.

# Creation Phase

## Purpose

The creation phase transforms knowledge, decisions, and requirements into structured documentation.

## Creation Principles

Documentation authors MUST:

- follow Documentation Standards,
- use approved terminology,
- respect naming conventions,
- maintain technical accuracy.

## Creation Sources

Documentation MAY be created from:

- RFC proposals,
- ADR decisions,
- specifications,
- implementation work,
- operational knowledge,
- user requirements.

## Documentation Structure

Created documents SHOULD include:

- purpose,
- context,
- main content,
- references,
- revision information when required.

# Review Phase

## Purpose

The review phase ensures that documentation quality meets FamilyOS expectations.

Documentation review verifies that information is:

- correct,
- understandable,
- complete,
- consistent.

## Review Participants

Reviews MAY involve:

- authors,
- maintainers,
- architects,
- domain specialists.

## Review Criteria

Reviewers SHOULD verify:

### Technical Accuracy

The document correctly describes:

- system behavior,
- architecture,
- requirements,
- constraints.

### Structural Compliance

The document follows:

- documentation standards,
- naming conventions,
- formatting rules.

### Terminology Compliance

The document uses approved FamilyOS vocabulary.

### Reference Quality

References are:

- valid,
- relevant,
- traceable.

# Validation Phase

## Purpose

Validation confirms that documentation satisfies required quality standards.

## Validation Activities

Validation MAY include:

- Markdown validation,
- link verification,
- structure checks,
- metadata validation,
- automated documentation checks.

## Validation Results

Validation results SHOULD be recorded for official artifacts.

Examples:

- RFC validation,
- ADR validation,
- EPIC validation,
- release documentation validation.

# Publication Phase

## Purpose

Publication makes approved documentation available to its intended audience.

## Publication Requirements

Before publication, documentation MUST:

- pass required validation,
- contain required metadata,
- follow repository organization rules.

## Published Documentation

Published documentation becomes part of the official FamilyOS knowledge base.

Published documents MUST remain discoverable and traceable.

# Maintenance Phase

## Purpose

Maintenance keeps documentation synchronized with system evolution.

## Maintenance Activities

Maintenance SHOULD identify:

- outdated information,
- broken references,
- obsolete examples,
- missing updates.

## Update Triggers

Documentation MUST be reviewed when:

- architecture changes,
- APIs change,
- workflows change,
- specifications change,
- release behavior changes.

## Maintenance Responsibility

Document owners and maintainers share responsibility for documentation accuracy.

# Evolution Phase

## Purpose

Evolution allows documentation to improve as FamilyOS grows.

## Evolution Activities

Documentation evolution MAY include:

- restructuring,
- clarification,
- additional examples,
- improved navigation,
- terminology updates.

## Evolution Principles

Changes SHOULD preserve:

- historical context,
- compatibility,
- traceability.

# Retirement Phase

## Purpose

Retirement manages documentation that is no longer actively maintained.

## Retirement Rules

A retired document MUST:

- remain traceable,
- indicate retirement status,
- reference replacement documentation when applicable.

Retired identifiers MUST NOT be reused.

## Archived Documentation

Archived documentation preserves historical knowledge.

Archived documents MAY remain accessible for:

- audits,
- historical analysis,
- migration reference.

# Lifecycle Governance

The Documentation Lifecycle is governed by:

- Documentation Standards,
- Quality Framework,
- Engineering Framework,
- Release Framework.

Lifecycle changes MUST preserve:

- documentation integrity,
- knowledge continuity,
- ecosystem consistency.

# Completion Criteria

A documentation artifact is considered lifecycle-complete when:

- required phases have been completed,
- validation requirements are satisfied,
- ownership is defined,
- references are maintained,
- future maintenance is possible.

The Documentation Lifecycle ensures that FamilyOS documentation remains a reliable foundation for long-term platform evolution.

# Documentation Framework

# 06 Documentation Templates

## Purpose

Documentation templates define the standard structures used to create consistent FamilyOS documentation artifacts.

Templates provide:

- predictable document organization,
- faster documentation creation,
- improved review efficiency,
- consistent presentation,
- reduced documentation drift.

Templates are reusable foundations and MUST follow Documentation Standards.

## Template Principles

FamilyOS documentation templates are based on the following principles:

- consistency,
- simplicity,
- traceability,
- maintainability,
- audience awareness.

Templates MUST provide structure without restricting meaningful documentation content.

## Template Categories

FamilyOS defines templates for different documentation artifact types.

Supported template categories include:

- RFC templates,
- ADR templates,
- EPIC templates,
- specification templates,
- guide templates,
- reference templates.

# RFC Template

## Purpose

RFC templates define the structure for technical proposals.

RFC documents describe:

- context,
- motivation,
- goals,
- architecture,
- implementation approach,
- validation strategy.

document additional requirements.
Template Governance

Templates are maintained as official FamilyOS documentation assets.

Changes to templates SHOULD be reviewed before adoption.

Template Validation

A document created from a template MUST still satisfy all Documentation Standards.

Future Template Evolution

Templates evolve as FamilyOS documentation requirements grow.

Future template improvements SHOULD focus on:

better automation,
improved contributor experience,
stronger consistency,
easier maintenance.

Documentation templates provide the foundation for scalable knowledge creation across the FamilyOS ecosystem.
