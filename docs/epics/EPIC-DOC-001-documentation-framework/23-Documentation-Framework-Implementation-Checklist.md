# Documentation Framework

## 23 Documentation Framework Implementation Checklist

### Context

The Documentation Framework defines the standards, processes, and governance required to manage FamilyOS documentation.

This implementation checklist verifies that the framework has been correctly applied within the FamilyOS repository and engineering workflow.

The objective is to ensure that the Documentation Framework is operational and ready to support future ecosystem development.

---

## Implementation Principles

The implementation checklist follows these principles.

### Completeness

All required documentation components must exist.

---

### Consistency

All documentation artifacts must follow the defined standards.

---

### Operational Readiness

Documentation processes must be usable by contributors.

---

### Continuous Improvement

The framework must support future evolution.

## Transition To Next Frameworks

After successful implementation, FamilyOS can proceed with:

### EPIC-ENG-001 — Engineering Foundation

Establishing:

* engineering standards,
* development workflows,
* coding practices,
* repository engineering rules.

---

### EPIC-TST-001 — Testing Framework

Establishing:

* testing strategy,
* validation methodology,
* quality assurance processes.

---

### EPIC-QLT-001 — Quality Framework

Establishing:

* quality management,
* measurable engineering excellence.

---

## Final Compliance

The Documentation Framework implementation is complete when:

* repository structure is aligned,
* standards are adopted,
* governance is operational,
* automation foundations exist,
* quality processes are integrated.

EPIC-DOC-001 provides the documentation foundation required for the next generation of FamilyOS engineering frameworks.
