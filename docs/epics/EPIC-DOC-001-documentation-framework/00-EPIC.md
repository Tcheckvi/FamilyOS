## Executive Summary

EPIC-DOC-001 establishes the canonical Documentation Framework for the FamilyOS ecosystem.

The framework defines how engineering documentation is designed, structured, created, reviewed, validated, maintained, versioned, governed, published, migrated, deprecated, measured, and evolved throughout the lifecycle of the FamilyOS platform.

FamilyOS treats documentation as a first-class engineering artifact.

Documentation is therefore not an activity performed only after implementation. It is an integrated engineering capability supporting architecture, development, testing, quality, security, operations, governance, release management, plugin development, and long-term knowledge preservation.

The Documentation Framework provides the common rules required to ensure that engineering knowledge remains discoverable, understandable, traceable, maintainable, reviewable, and reproducible over time.

---

## Vision

The FamilyOS Documentation Framework establishes a reliable and scalable engineering knowledge system.

Its vision is to create a documentation ecosystem in which every significant engineering decision, architectural principle, specification, process, standard, and implementation guideline can be:

* discovered;
* understood;
* validated;
* reviewed;
* maintained;
* versioned;
* traced to its origin;
* evolved safely.

Documentation SHALL evolve together with the software system and engineering processes it describes.

---

## Context

FamilyOS is designed as a long-lived platform composed of multiple domains, plugins, frameworks, specifications, architectural decisions, operational capabilities, and engineering processes.

As the platform grows, engineering knowledge must not depend on individual contributors or undocumented institutional memory.

Without a common documentation framework, repository documentation can develop:

* inconsistent structures;
* incompatible naming conventions;
* unclear ownership;
* duplicated information;
* missing traceability;
* obsolete references;
* uncontrolled lifecycle states;
* inconsistent metadata;
* weak validation;
* difficult maintenance;
* undocumented migrations;
* unreliable release evidence.

EPIC-DOC-001 establishes the documentation foundation required to prevent these conditions.

---

## Problem Statement

FamilyOS requires a canonical documentation system capable of preserving engineering knowledge across the complete platform lifecycle.

The system must provide consistent rules for:

* document structure;
* document naming;
* metadata;
* versioning;
* lifecycle management;
* templates;
* governance;
* automation;
* validation;
* quality gates;
* repository organization;
* review;
* maintenance;
* migration;
* deprecation;
* metrics;
* framework validation;
* framework release.

Without these rules, documentation quality and repository consistency cannot be reliably governed as FamilyOS scales.

---

## Objectives

EPIC-DOC-001 SHALL establish the canonical FamilyOS Documentation Framework.

The framework SHALL:

1. define a consistent documentation architecture;
2. establish documentation standards and conventions;
3. define documentation lifecycle rules;
4. define reusable documentation templates;
5. establish canonical metadata requirements;
6. define documentation versioning rules;
7. establish governance responsibilities;
8. define documentation automation capabilities;
9. establish documentation quality gates;
10. define repository organization rules;
11. establish documentation review processes;
12. define maintenance requirements;
13. define migration strategies;
14. define deprecation policies;
15. establish documentation metrics;
16. provide framework-level validation requirements;
17. define release-readiness requirements;
18. preserve engineering knowledge over time;
19. improve traceability between engineering artifacts;
20. enable future documentation automation.

---

## Scope

EPIC-DOC-001 governs engineering documentation maintained within the FamilyOS repository and associated engineering lifecycle.

The framework covers:

* documentation architecture;
* documentation standards;
* documentation lifecycle;
* documentation templates;
* documentation metadata;
* documentation versioning;
* documentation governance;
* documentation automation;
* documentation quality gates;
* documentation repository organization;
* documentation review;
* documentation maintenance;
* documentation migration;
* documentation deprecation;
* documentation metrics;
* documentation validation;
* framework release;
* framework implementation readiness.

The framework applies to documentation associated with:

* architecture;
* ADRs;
* RFCs;
* EPICs;
* specifications;
* engineering frameworks;
* plugins;
* development guidance;
* operational guidance;
* reference material;
* templates;
* release evidence.

---

## Out of Scope

EPIC-DOC-001 does not define the business behavior of individual FamilyOS domains.

It does not replace:

* domain specifications;
* plugin specifications;
* security policies;
* testing specifications;
* build specifications;
* release specifications;
* operational procedures;
* source-code implementation rules owned by other frameworks.

Instead, EPIC-DOC-001 defines how those documentation artifacts SHALL be structured, governed, validated, maintained, and evolved.

---

## Documentation Principles

### Documentation Is an Engineering Artifact

Documentation SHALL be treated with the same engineering discipline applied to source code and other repository artifacts.

---

### Single Source of Truth

Canonical information SHOULD have one authoritative repository location.

Duplicate normative definitions SHOULD be avoided.

---

### Explicit Ownership

Documentation SHALL have identifiable ownership or an explicitly governed maintenance responsibility.

---

### Traceability

Important documentation SHALL be traceable to relevant engineering context, including where applicable:

* EPICs;
* RFCs;
* ADRs;
* specifications;
* implementations;
* tests;
* releases;
* repository history.

---

### Maintainability

Documentation SHALL be structured so that contributors can safely understand, review, update, and validate it.

---

### Version Control

Canonical FamilyOS documentation SHALL be maintained under version control.

Repository history SHALL provide durable evidence of documentation evolution.

---

### Validation

Documentation SHALL be subject to appropriate structural, semantic, and repository validation.

---

### Evolution

The Documentation Framework SHALL support controlled evolution without losing historical traceability.

---

## Documentation Architecture

The FamilyOS documentation architecture organizes engineering knowledge into multiple complementary layers.

### Strategic Documentation Layer

This layer describes high-level direction and engineering intent.

Typical artifacts include:

* vision documents;
* EPICs;
* roadmaps;
* framework definitions.

---

### Governance Documentation Layer

This layer defines engineering rules and decision structures.

Typical artifacts include:

* policies;
* standards;
* governance documents;
* ADRs;
* lifecycle definitions.

---

### Specification Documentation Layer

This layer defines expected behavior and technical contracts.

Typical artifacts include:

* RFCs;
* specifications;
* interface contracts;
* plugin contracts;
* architecture specifications.

---

### Implementation Documentation Layer

This layer supports practical engineering execution.

Typical artifacts include:

* implementation guides;
* operational guides;
* reference documentation;
* examples;
* templates;
* migration instructions.

---

## Canonical Document Set

EPIC-DOC-001 uses the following canonical numbered-document structure:

| Number | Document                                                 |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| 00     | `00-EPIC.md`                                             |
| 01     | `01-Introduction.md`                                     |
| 02     | `02-Documentation-Vision.md`                             |
| 03     | `03-Documentation-Architecture.md`                       |
| 04     | `04-Documentation-Standards.md`                          |
| 05     | `05-Documentation-Lifecycle.md`                          |
| 06     | `06-Documentation-Templates.md`                          |
| 07     | `07-Documentation-Metadata.md`                           |
| 08     | `08-Documentation-Versioning.md`                         |
| 09     | `09-Documentation-Lifecycle.md`                          |
| 10     | `10-Documentation-Governance.md`                         |
| 11     | `11-Documentation-Templates.md`                          |
| 12     | `12-Documentation-Automation.md`                         |
| 13     | `13-Documentation-Quality-Gates.md`                      |
| 14     | `14-Documentation-Repository-Organization.md`            |
| 15     | `15-Documentation-Review-Process.md`                     |
| 16     | `16-Documentation-Maintenance.md`                        |
| 17     | `17-Documentation-Migration-Strategy.md`                 |
| 18     | `18-Documentation-Deprecation-Policy.md`                 |
| 19     | `19-Documentation-Metrics.md`                            |
| 20     | `20-Documentation-Framework-Validation.md`               |
| 21     | `21-Documentation-Framework-Summary.md`                  |
| 22     | `22-Documentation-Framework-Release.md`                  |
| 23     | `23-Documentation-Framework-Implementation-Checklist.md` |

The canonical numbered-document range is therefore:

```text
00-23
```

The framework contains:

```text
24 numbered documents
```

---

## Control Documents

The canonical framework control-document set is:

* `EPIC-DOC-001.md`;
* `EPIC.yaml`;
* `README.md`;
* `MANIFEST.md`;
* `CHANGELOG.md`;
* `VALIDATION.md`;
* `Revision-History.md`.

These documents provide repository-level framework identity, machine-readable metadata, navigation, inventory, change history, validation evidence, and revision history.

The complete canonical framework target is therefore:

```text
24 numbered documents
+ 7 control documents
----------------------
31 canonical files
```

---

## Documentation Lifecycle

Documentation SHALL progress through a controlled lifecycle.

A typical lifecycle may include:

```text
Draft
  ↓
Review
  ↓
Validation
  ↓
Approval
  ↓
Publication
  ↓
Maintenance
  ↓
Revision
  ↓
Deprecation
  ↓
Archival
```

Lifecycle transitions SHALL preserve traceability and SHALL NOT silently destroy relevant historical information.

---

## Documentation Governance

Documentation governance SHALL define:

* ownership;
* review responsibility;
* approval responsibility;
* validation responsibility;
* change control;
* lifecycle management;
* exception handling;
* deprecation authority.

Governance rules SHOULD scale according to the importance and risk of the documentation artifact.

---

## Documentation Quality

Canonical FamilyOS documentation SHOULD satisfy the following quality properties:

* correctness;
* completeness;
* consistency;
* clarity;
* discoverability;
* traceability;
* maintainability;
* reproducibility;
* appropriate versioning;
* structural validity.

Documentation quality SHALL be evaluated through defined quality gates and validation mechanisms.

---

## Documentation Automation

The framework SHOULD enable automation where automation improves reliability or reduces repetitive manual work.

Potential automation areas include:

* metadata validation;
* naming validation;
* structure validation;
* link validation;
* inventory generation;
* documentation generation;
* quality-gate enforcement;
* release validation;
* repository consistency checks.

Automation SHALL support the documentation lifecycle rather than replace engineering review and ownership.

---

## Repository Organization

Documentation SHALL be organized predictably within the FamilyOS repository.

The framework recognizes documentation categories such as:

```text
docs/
├── adr/
├── rfcs/
├── epics/
├── specs/
├── architecture/
├── plugins/
├── guides/
├── reference/
└── templates/
```

Actual repository structure SHALL remain governed by the canonical repository architecture and may evolve through controlled migration.

---

## Review and Maintenance

Documentation SHALL remain maintainable after initial publication.

Review and maintenance processes SHALL address:

* correctness;
* stale information;
* broken references;
* terminology drift;
* structural drift;
* ownership changes;
* superseded requirements;
* repository migrations.

Documentation changes SHALL remain reviewable through repository history.

---

## Migration and Deprecation

The framework SHALL provide controlled mechanisms for documentation migration and deprecation.

Migration SHALL preserve:

* important content;
* traceability;
* repository history where practical;
* references to replacement artifacts.

Deprecated documentation SHALL clearly communicate its state and SHOULD identify its replacement when one exists.

---

## Metrics

Documentation metrics MAY be used to evaluate framework health.

Metrics may include:

* coverage;
* validation success;
* stale-document counts;
* broken-reference counts;
* review completion;
* metadata compliance;
* structural compliance;
* maintenance activity.

Metrics SHALL support engineering decisions and SHALL NOT become substitutes for documentation quality judgment.

---

## Validation Model

EPIC-DOC-001 SHALL be validated at multiple levels.

### Structural Validation

Validation SHALL verify:

* expected files;
* numbering integrity;
* naming consistency;
* required control documents;
* absence of unintended duplicates;
* absence of unexpected empty canonical documents.

### Semantic Validation

Validation SHALL verify consistency between:

* framework objectives;
* architecture;
* lifecycle;
* governance;
* automation;
* quality;
* maintenance;
* migration;
* deprecation;
* metrics;
* release requirements.

### Repository Validation

Repository validation SHALL verify that the framework is compatible with the current FamilyOS repository state and engineering quality requirements.

### Release Validation

Release validation SHALL verify that the framework satisfies its defined release-readiness criteria.

---

## Release Model

The Documentation Framework defines version `1.0.0` as its initial framework baseline.

Historical release evidence SHALL be determined from repository history and existing release records during final revalidation.

No historical Git tag or historical commit SHALL be rewritten merely to normalize the current documentation structure.

If historical release evidence already exists, it SHALL remain immutable and the normalization SHALL be recorded as a subsequent repository change.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

EPIC-DOC-001 is considered structurally normalized when:

* the canonical numbered range is `00-23`;
* exactly 24 numbered documents exist;
* no numbering collisions remain;
* all numbered documents are non-empty;
* the seven canonical control documents exist;
* `EPIC.yaml` matches the filesystem contract;
* `MANIFEST.md` matches the filesystem contract;
* `README.md` describes the canonical structure;
* validation evidence is recorded;
* repository quality gates pass;
* release history is preserved;
* final repository state is internally consistent.

---

## Current Revalidation State

The numbered-document structure has been normalized toward the canonical `00-23` sequence.

Final framework status SHALL NOT be inferred solely from historical release language.

The current repository state must be revalidated against:

* filesystem structure;
* control-document consistency;
* metadata consistency;
* historical release evidence;
* repository quality gates;
* final working-tree state.

Until that revalidation is complete, repository validation and final revalidation remain pending.

---

## Deliverables

The EPIC-DOC-001 canonical deliverables consist of:

```text
Numbered documents: 24
Control documents:   7
Canonical files:    31
```

The numbered-document range is:

```text
00-23
```

The control-document set is:

```text
EPIC-DOC-001.md
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

---

## Definition of Done

EPIC-DOC-001 reaches final validated closure when:

* canonical structure is complete;
* numbering is deterministic;
* duplicate legacy skeletons are removed;
* all control documents are aligned;
* machine-readable metadata is valid;
* documentation inventory is correct;
* validation evidence is complete;
* historical release evidence is verified;
* repository quality gates pass;
* final repository state is clean;
* the framework can be independently reconstructed from repository history.

---

## Summary

EPIC-DOC-001 establishes documentation as a governed engineering capability within FamilyOS.

The framework provides a common foundation for documentation architecture, standards, lifecycle management, metadata, versioning, governance, automation, quality, repository organization, review, maintenance, migration, deprecation, metrics, validation, and release management.

Its purpose is not merely to produce documentation.

Its purpose is to ensure that FamilyOS engineering knowledge remains reliable, traceable, maintainable, discoverable, and sustainable throughout the long-term evolution of the platform.
