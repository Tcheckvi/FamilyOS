# Observability Framework

## EPIC-OBS-001

### Observability Framework

### Overview

EPIC-OBS-001 — Observability Framework establishes the official observability foundation for the FamilyOS ecosystem.

The framework defines how FamilyOS produces, structures, correlates, protects, analyzes, and uses runtime evidence.

It provides a common architectural foundation for:

* structured logging;
* metrics;
* distributed and local tracing;
* correlation;
* health evaluation;
* diagnostics;
* alerting;
* observability security;
* privacy;
* governance;
* runtime automation.

Observability is treated as a core engineering capability.

FamilyOS must not only be correctly designed, tested, built, and released.

It must also be capable of explaining what happens while it is running.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of EPIC-OBS-001 is to establish a unified observability model across FamilyOS.

The framework enables the platform to answer fundamental runtime questions:

```text
What happened?

Where did it happen?

When did it happen?

How long did it take?

What was affected?

Why did it fail?

Can related operations be correlated?

Is the system healthy?

Does the condition require attention?
```

The framework provides the architectural contracts required to answer these questions consistently.

---

## Problem Statement

FamilyOS consists of an expanding set of:

* platform components;
* application services;
* domain capabilities;
* repositories;
* workflows;
* official plugins;
* third-party plugins;
* integrations;
* automation;
* external dependencies.

As execution crosses these boundaries, runtime behavior becomes increasingly difficult to understand without standardized operational evidence.

Without a common observability architecture, components may independently implement incompatible approaches to:

* logging;
* metrics;
* tracing;
* health checks;
* diagnostics;
* correlation;
* alerting.

This would create fragmented operational visibility and increase the cost of debugging, testing, operating, and evolving FamilyOS.

EPIC-OBS-001 prevents this fragmentation by establishing common observability contracts before operational complexity grows further.

---

## Vision

The FamilyOS observability vision is:

> Every significant FamilyOS operation should produce enough structured, secure, and correlatable evidence to understand its runtime behavior without unnecessarily exposing the information being processed.

The objective is not maximum telemetry.

The objective is trustworthy runtime understanding.

---

## Core Principle

FamilyOS follows the principle:

> Observe system behavior, not private family content.

Observability exists to understand execution.

It must not become an uncontrolled secondary data store.

---

## Strategic Position

The Observability Framework extends the existing FamilyOS engineering foundation into runtime execution.

```text

    ▼
Operations
```

Testing provides evidence before execution.

Build provides artifact evidence.

Release provides publication evidence.

Observability provides runtime evidence.

Operations will consume that runtime evidence.

---

## Relationship With Existing Frameworks

EPIC-OBS-001 builds upon the existing FamilyOS engineering foundations.

```text
FamilyOS Engineering Platform
        │
        ├── Engineering Foundation
        ├── Documentation Framework
        ├── Testing Framework
        ├── Quality Framework
        ├── Build Framework
        ├── Release Framework
        ├── Plugin Compliance Framework
        └── Observability Framework
```

The framework does not replace any existing engineering capability.

It connects them to runtime behavior.

---

## Objectives

EPIC-OBS-001 establishes:

1. a common observability vocabulary;
2. structured logging conventions;
3. metric semantics;
4. tracing foundations;
5. correlation mechanisms;
6. health-state semantics;
7. controlled diagnostics;
8. alerting foundations;
9. observability data lifecycle principles;
10. security and privacy requirements;
11. plugin observability expectations;
12. implementation guidance;
13. automation foundations;
14. validation and release criteria.

---

## Scope

EPIC-OBS-001 covers the architectural foundations for:

* logs;
* metrics;
* traces;
* runtime events;
* correlation context;
* health checks;
* health aggregation;
* diagnostics;
* alert conditions;
* telemetry data;
* signal schemas;
* data minimization;
* security;
* privacy;
* retention;
* plugin integration;
* testing;
* automation;
* observability providers and adapters.

---

## Out of Scope

EPIC-OBS-001 does not require:

* a production monitoring cluster;
* a centralized logging platform;
* a dedicated metrics database;
* a specific telemetry vendor;
* production dashboards;
* a complete incident-management system;
* advanced anomaly detection;
* machine-learning monitoring;
* business analytics;
* user behavior analytics;
* unrestricted diagnostic data collection.

These capabilities may be introduced later when justified by concrete operational requirements.

---

## Observability Model

FamilyOS organizes observability around five primary runtime signal categories.

```text
                    Runtime
                       │
        ┌──────────────┼──────────────┐
        │              │              │
      Logs          Metrics         Traces
        │              │              │
        └──────────┬───┴───┬──────────┘
                   │       │
                 Health Diagnostics
                   │       │
                   └───┬───┘
                       │
                Correlation Context
                       │
                       ▼
               Runtime Understanding
```

Alerting consumes these signals to identify operational conditions requiring attention.

---

## Logs

Logs describe significant runtime events.

FamilyOS logging SHOULD be:

* structured;
* meaningful;
* severity-aware;
* correlatable;
* privacy-safe;
* machine-readable where practical.

Logs must not become uncontrolled dumps of application state.

---

## Metrics

Metrics quantify runtime behavior.

They may measure:

* execution counts;
* failures;
* retries;
* durations;
* latency;
* queue state;
* dependency behavior;
* resource state.

Metric dimensions must remain bounded and privacy-safe.

---

## Traces

Traces describe execution paths across architectural boundaries.

Tracing may cover:

```text
Entry Point
    ↓
Application
    ↓
Capability
    ↓
Plugin
    ↓
Repository
    ↓
External Dependency
```

Tracing SHOULD focus on meaningful operations rather than every internal function call.

---

## Health

Health describes whether a component can perform its intended responsibility.

FamilyOS defines the canonical health states:

```text
HEALTHY
DEGRADED
UNHEALTHY
UNKNOWN
```

These semantics must remain consistent across platform and plugin components.

---

## Diagnostics

Diagnostics provide deeper evidence when normal telemetry is insufficient to explain abnormal behavior.

Diagnostics must remain controlled.

They MUST NOT become unrestricted exports of:

* private family data;
* credentials;
* secrets;
* arbitrary internal state.

---

## Alerting

Alerts identify operational conditions requiring attention.

FamilyOS distinguishes alerts from individual logs or errors.

```text
Runtime Evidence
       ↓
Condition
       ↓
Evaluation
       ↓
Alert
       ↓
Action
```

The initial framework defines alerting foundations without requiring a complete incident-management platform.

---

## Correlation

Correlation is a first-class observability capability.

Signals belonging to the same logical execution SHOULD be connectable.

The minimal context may include:

```text
correlation_id
trace_id
operation_id
```

Additional identifiers may be introduced only when justified.

Correlation identifiers MUST remain opaque and MUST NOT encode private family information.

---

## Runtime Evidence

FamilyOS defines observability signals collectively as runtime evidence.

```text
Source Code
    ↓
Tests
    ↓
Quality Evidence
    ↓
Build Evidence
    ↓
Release Evidence
    ↓
Runtime Evidence
```

Runtime evidence extends the FamilyOS engineering evidence model into actual execution.

---

## Security

Observability infrastructure must follow FamilyOS security principles.

Secrets MUST NOT intentionally appear in telemetry.

This includes:

* passwords;
* authentication tokens;
* API keys;
* encryption keys;
* session secrets;
* private cryptographic material;
* equivalent credentials.

Security invariants cannot be disabled through logging or diagnostic configuration.

---

## Privacy

FamilyOS observability follows privacy-by-design and data-minimization principles.

The preferred model is:

```text
Private Operation
       ↓
Operational Description
       ↓
Safe Runtime Evidence
```

rather than:

```text
Private Operation
       ↓
Private Content
       ↓
Telemetry
```

Family content should remain outside observability signals unless an exceptional and explicitly governed requirement exists.

---

## Vendor Neutrality

FamilyOS observability contracts MUST remain independent of specific external telemetry vendors.

The architecture is:

```text
FamilyOS Component
       ↓
Observability Contract
       ↓
Provider / Adapter
       ↓
Telemetry Backend
```

Possible providers may include:

```text
Local
In-Memory
Test
External
```

Core FamilyOS components must not depend directly on vendor-specific telemetry SDKs.

---

## Plugin Observability

Official and compliant third-party plugins participate in the same observability architecture.

Plugins SHOULD use FamilyOS contracts for:

* logging;
* metrics;
* tracing;
* correlation;
* health;
* diagnostics.

Plugins MUST NOT bypass platform security, privacy, or telemetry-governance requirements.

The Plugin Compliance Framework may validate applicable observability requirements.

---

## Implementation Strategy

Implementation is intentionally incremental.

```text
Core Contracts
      ↓
Correlation Context
      ↓
Structured Logging
      ↓
Basic Metrics
      ↓
Basic Tracing
      ↓
Health
      ↓
Diagnostics
      ↓
Platform Instrumentation
      ↓
Plugin Integration
      ↓
Validation
```

External telemetry infrastructure is not required for the initial implementation.

---

## Initial Implementation Target

The first implementation SHOULD provide the smallest useful observability runtime.

A suitable target is:

```text
ObservabilityContext
        +
Structured Logger
        +
Basic Meter
        +
Basic Tracer
        +
Health Models
        +
Basic Diagnostics
        +
In-Memory Test Provider
```

This foundation must be usable before external observability platforms are introduced.

---

## Automation

Structured observability contracts prepare FamilyOS for future automation.

Potential consumers include:

* health monitoring;
* release verification;
* regression detection;
* automated diagnostics;
* plugin compliance;
* quality gates;
* dependency monitoring;
* operational recovery.

The progression is:

```text
Runtime
   ↓
Observability
   ↓
Evidence
   ↓
Evaluation
   ↓
Decision
   ↓
Automation
```

Operational actions themselves primarily belong to the future Operations Framework.

---

## Engineering Constraints

The implementation MUST remain aligned with existing FamilyOS engineering standards.

Applicable implementation code must pass:

```text
Ruff
MyPy
Pytest
```

Observability code is subject to the same architecture, quality, testing, and release expectations as the rest of FamilyOS.

---

## Documentation Strategy

EPIC-OBS-001 deliberately uses a compact documentation model.

The goal is to document the architecture required for implementation without reproducing the large documentation structures of earlier foundational EPICs.

The canonical document set is limited to:

```text
00-EPIC.md
01-Context-and-Vision.md
02-Observability-Principles.md
03-Observability-Architecture.md
04-Logging-Metrics-and-Tracing.md
05-Health-Diagnostics-and-Alerting.md
06-Observability-Data-and-Correlation.md
07-Security-Privacy-and-Governance.md
08-Implementation-and-Automation.md
09-Validation-and-Release.md
```

No additional documentation is required unless implementation exposes a concrete architectural gap.

---

## Deliverables

EPIC-OBS-001 delivers:

* the FamilyOS observability architecture;
* observability principles;
* logging contracts;
* metric conventions;
* tracing foundations;
* health semantics;
* diagnostic boundaries;
* alerting foundations;
* correlation architecture;
* observability data rules;
* security and privacy controls;
* implementation strategy;
* automation foundations;
* validation and release requirements.

---

## Validation

The framework must demonstrate that the proposed architecture can support:

* structured runtime signals;
* correlation propagation;
* bounded metrics;
* trace relationships;
* deterministic health evaluation;
* controlled diagnostics;
* privacy-safe telemetry;
* plugin participation;
* deterministic testing;
* provider replacement.

Implementation validation must follow the criteria defined by `09-Validation-and-Release.md`.

---

## Definition of Done

EPIC-OBS-001 is complete when:

* all canonical documents are present;
* the observability architecture is internally consistent;
* signal responsibilities are clearly separated;
* correlation semantics are defined;
* security and privacy constraints are explicit;
* plugin integration expectations are established;
* implementation boundaries are defined;
* validation criteria are satisfied;
* no unresolved architectural blocker prevents implementation;
* the framework is ready to transition from documentation to code.

---

## Post-EPIC Rule

After EPIC-OBS-001 is validated, documentation expansion stops unless implementation identifies a real architectural requirement.

The workflow becomes:

```text
EPIC-OBS-001
      ↓
Validation
      ↓
Implementation
      ↓
Tests
      ↓
Quality Gates
      ↓
Release
```

The next priority is working software.

---

## Success Criteria

EPIC-OBS-001 succeeds when FamilyOS has enough architecture to implement observability without requiring another documentation phase.

The resulting foundation must be:

```text
Structured
Correlatable
Secure
Private
Testable
Vendor-Neutral
Incremental
Simple
```

---

## Expected Outcome

After EPIC-OBS-001, FamilyOS will possess a unified architecture for understanding its own runtime behavior.

The platform will be prepared to answer:

```text
What happened?
Where?
When?
How long?
Why?
What failed?
What was affected?
Is the system healthy?
Can the evidence be correlated?
Does action need to be taken?
```

This provides the bridge between the FamilyOS engineering platform and future operational capabilities.
