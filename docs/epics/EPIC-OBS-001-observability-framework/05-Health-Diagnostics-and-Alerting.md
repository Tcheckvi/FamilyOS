# Health, Diagnostics, and Alerting

## EPIC-OBS-001

### Health, Diagnostics, and Alerting

### Overview

This document defines the FamilyOS foundation for:

* health evaluation;
* runtime diagnostics;
* alert generation.

These capabilities complement logs, metrics, and traces by answering three operational questions:

```text
Health       → Is the system able to operate?
Diagnostics  → What explains its current condition?
Alerting     → Does this condition require attention?
```

FamilyOS treats these mechanisms as related but distinct responsibilities.

Health describes operational state.

Diagnostics provide investigation evidence.

Alerts communicate significant conditions requiring action.

---

## Objectives

The health, diagnostics, and alerting model must:

* expose meaningful operational state;
* detect degraded behavior;
* support automated health evaluation;
* provide controlled diagnostic evidence;
* distinguish symptoms from root causes;
* avoid unnecessary alerts;
* protect sensitive information;
* support plugins and dependencies;
* remain vendor-neutral;
* support future operational automation.

---

## Health Model

Health represents the current ability of a component or system to perform its intended responsibilities.

FamilyOS defines four conceptual health states:

```text
HEALTHY
DEGRADED
UNHEALTHY
UNKNOWN
```

These states provide a consistent vocabulary across the platform.

---

## HEALTHY

A component is `HEALTHY` when it can perform its intended responsibilities within expected operating conditions.

Examples:

* required dependencies are available;
* initialization completed successfully;
* required resources are accessible;
* no significant operational degradation is detected.

`HEALTHY` does not mean that every previous operation succeeded.

It describes the current operational capability of the component.

---

## DEGRADED

A component is `DEGRADED` when it remains operational but some capability, dependency, or performance characteristic is impaired.

Examples include:

* an optional dependency is unavailable;
* retries are occurring above normal levels;
* latency exceeds expected thresholds;
* a secondary capability is unavailable;
* a non-critical resource is constrained.

Degraded operation SHOULD remain visible before it becomes a complete failure.

---

## UNHEALTHY

A component is `UNHEALTHY` when it cannot reliably perform an essential responsibility.

Examples include:

* initialization failure;
* required dependency unavailable;
* critical storage inaccessible;
* essential configuration invalid;
* persistent critical execution failure.

An unhealthy state SHOULD provide enough context to identify the failing operational area without exposing protected data.

---

## UNKNOWN

A component is `UNKNOWN` when its health cannot currently be determined reliably.

Examples:

* health evaluation timed out;
* diagnostic dependency unavailable;
* health provider failed;
* state has not yet been evaluated.

`UNKNOWN` MUST NOT automatically be interpreted as `HEALTHY`.

---

## Health State Ordering

For aggregation purposes, FamilyOS conceptually treats health severity as:

```text
HEALTHY
   ↓
DEGRADED
   ↓
UNKNOWN
   ↓
UNHEALTHY
```

Implementations MAY apply more specific aggregation policies when required.

The meaning of each state must remain stable.

---

## Health Checks

A health check evaluates a specific operational condition.

Examples include:

```text
configuration
repository
database
filesystem
plugin
external dependency
background worker
integration
```

A health check SHOULD have a clear operational purpose.

Health checks SHOULD NOT perform expensive or destructive operations merely to prove availability.

---

## Health Check Result

A conceptual health result may contain:

```text
check_name
component
status
timestamp
duration
reason
dependency
metadata
```

The result should contain enough information for interpretation while remaining safe to expose within its intended operational boundary.

---

## Health Aggregation

Multiple health checks may contribute to component or system health.

Conceptually:

```text
Repository ─────── HEALTHY ──┐
                             │
Plugin ─────────── HEALTHY ──┤
                             ├──► FamilyOS Health
Integration ───── DEGRADED ──┤
                             │
Configuration ─── HEALTHY ───┘
```

The aggregate result in this example may be:

```text
DEGRADED
```

Aggregation rules MUST be deterministic.

---

## Critical and Optional Dependencies

Not all dependencies have equal operational importance.

FamilyOS SHOULD distinguish between:

```text
required dependency
optional dependency
```

A required dependency failure may produce:

```text
UNHEALTHY
```

while an optional dependency failure may produce:

```text
DEGRADED
```

The classification must be defined by architecture rather than decided dynamically by arbitrary health-check implementations.

---

## Health and Plugins

Plugins SHOULD expose health information when they depend on runtime resources or external systems whose availability affects their capabilities.

Conceptually:

```text
Plugin
  │
  ├── Lifecycle Health
  ├── Capability Health
  └── Dependency Health
```

A plugin SHOULD NOT report itself as healthy when an essential dependency prevents its primary capability from functioning.

---

## Health and Startup

FamilyOS may evaluate health during startup.

The lifecycle may conceptually progress through:

```text
Starting
   ↓
Initializing
   ↓
Health Evaluation
   ↓
Ready
```

A component should not report operational readiness before required initialization has completed successfully.

---

## Readiness and Health

Readiness and health are related but not identical.

Health asks:

> Can the component perform its intended responsibility?

Readiness asks:

> Should the component currently receive work?

A component may temporarily be healthy but not yet ready during startup or controlled transitions.

Future implementations MAY expose separate readiness semantics where required.

---

## Liveness

Liveness answers whether a running process or component is still capable of making progress.

FamilyOS MAY introduce explicit liveness checks when deployment infrastructure requires them.

Liveness checks should remain simple.

They MUST NOT depend unnecessarily on every external dependency.

---

## Health Signal Stability

Health checks should avoid rapid oscillation between states.

For unstable dependencies, implementations MAY use mechanisms such as:

* consecutive failure thresholds;
* recovery thresholds;
* evaluation windows;
* controlled retry intervals.

These mechanisms must not hide persistent failures.

---

## Diagnostics Model

Diagnostics provide deeper evidence for understanding abnormal system behavior.

Diagnostics complement normal observability signals.

```text
Symptom
   │
   ▼
Health / Alert
   │
   ▼
Logs / Metrics / Traces
   │
   ▼
Diagnostics
   │
   ▼
Investigation
```

Diagnostics SHOULD be used when normal telemetry is insufficient to explain a condition.

---

## Diagnostic Information

Diagnostic information may include:

* component state;
* dependency state;
* configuration validity;
* recent failure categories;
* initialization status;
* queue state;
* retry state;
* resource availability;
* plugin state;
* execution context.

Diagnostics MUST NOT become an unrestricted dump of internal memory or family data.

---

## Diagnostic Levels

FamilyOS may conceptually support diagnostic detail levels such as:

```text
BASIC
DETAILED
```

`BASIC` diagnostics provide safe operational information suitable for normal investigation.

`DETAILED` diagnostics may expose deeper technical state and therefore require stronger access controls.

The implementation does not need to support multiple levels initially unless a concrete requirement exists.

---

## Diagnostic Safety

Diagnostics MUST protect:

* credentials;
* secrets;
* authentication material;
* cryptographic keys;
* private family content;
* protected personal information.

Diagnostic convenience does not override security or privacy.

---

## Diagnostic Context

A diagnostic record SHOULD identify the relevant operational context.

Useful fields may include:

```text
timestamp
component
operation
correlation_id
trace_id
health_state
failure_category
dependency
```

This allows diagnostic information to connect with other observability signals.

---

## Diagnostic Snapshots

Future implementations MAY support diagnostic snapshots.

A snapshot represents controlled operational state captured at a specific point in time.

Conceptually:

```text
Diagnostic Snapshot
        │
        ├── Component State
        ├── Dependency State
        ├── Health State
        ├── Configuration Status
        └── Recent Failure Summary
```

Snapshots MUST be filtered before persistence or export.

---

## Diagnostic Failure

Diagnostic mechanisms can themselves fail.

A diagnostic failure SHOULD NOT normally cause the business operation being diagnosed to fail.

Instead, FamilyOS should preserve the original operational result and record that diagnostic evidence was unavailable where practical.

---

## Alerting Model

An alert represents an operational condition requiring attention.

Alerts SHOULD be generated from meaningful conditions rather than arbitrary individual telemetry events.

Conceptually:

```text
Runtime Signals
      │
      ▼
Condition Evaluation
      │
      ▼
Alert Rule
      │
      ▼
Alert
      │
      ▼
Action
```

---

## Alerts Are Not Logs

A log event records something that happened.

An alert communicates that a condition requires attention.

For example:

```text
ERROR log
```

does not automatically require an alert.

A single operation failure may be expected or recoverable.

An alert may instead result from:

```text
failure rate > threshold
```

or:

```text
required dependency unhealthy
```

This distinction prevents unnecessary operational noise.

---

## Alert Sources

Alerts may eventually be derived from:

* health states;
* metrics;
* failure rates;
* latency;
* repeated retries;
* dependency availability;
* critical log events;
* trace outcomes;
* security signals.

The alerting layer SHOULD consume standardized observability contracts.

---

## Alert Severity

FamilyOS conceptually defines alert severity independently from log severity.

A simple initial model is:

```text
WARNING
CRITICAL
```

`WARNING` indicates a condition requiring awareness or investigation.

`CRITICAL` indicates a condition requiring urgent operational attention.

Additional severity levels SHOULD only be introduced if actual operational requirements justify them.

---

## Alert Structure

A conceptual alert may contain:

```text
alert_id
alert_name
severity
status
timestamp
component
condition
correlation_context
summary
```

Alerts SHOULD describe the operational condition rather than expose raw private data.

---

## Alert Lifecycle

Alerts have a lifecycle.

```text
Condition Detected
       ↓
Alert Open
       ↓
Acknowledged
       ↓
Condition Recovers
       ↓
Resolved
```

The initial implementation does not need a complete incident-management platform.

However, alert state SHOULD be distinguishable from individual alert events.

---

## Alert Deduplication

Repeated observations of the same condition SHOULD NOT create uncontrolled duplicate alerts.

For example:

```text
dependency unavailable
dependency unavailable
dependency unavailable
dependency unavailable
```

should normally represent one continuing operational condition rather than four independent incidents.

Alert identity and deduplication mechanisms may evolve with the Operations Framework.

---

## Alert Noise

Alert fatigue reduces operational reliability.

FamilyOS therefore follows the principle:

> Alert on actionable conditions, not every abnormal event.

An alert should ideally correspond to a condition for which a person or automated system can take meaningful action.

---

## Recovery Signals

FamilyOS SHOULD detect recovery when an alerting condition no longer exists.

For example:

```text
Dependency Healthy
       ↓
Dependency Failure
       ↓
Alert Open
       ↓
Dependency Recovers
       ↓
Alert Resolved
```

Recovery is operational evidence and SHOULD be observable.

---

## Health-to-Alert Relationship

Health state changes may trigger alert evaluation.

For example:

```text
HEALTHY
   ↓
DEGRADED ─────► possible WARNING
   ↓
UNHEALTHY ────► possible CRITICAL
```

The relationship is not necessarily one-to-one.

Alert policies determine whether a state transition requires action.

---

## Metrics-to-Alert Relationship

Metrics may drive threshold-based or trend-based alerts.

Examples:

```text
failure_rate > threshold

latency > threshold

retry_rate > threshold

queue_depth > threshold
```

Thresholds SHOULD be configurable without changing metric semantics.

---

## Trace-to-Diagnostic Relationship

Tracing can identify where an operation failed.

Diagnostics can then provide deeper information about the affected component.

```text
Failed Trace
     │
     ▼
Failed Span
     │
     ▼
Component
     │
     ▼
Diagnostics
```

This supports targeted investigation instead of broad diagnostic collection.

---

## Correlation

Health, diagnostics, and alerts SHOULD participate in the same correlation model as logs and traces where applicable.

Useful identifiers include:

```text
correlation_id
trace_id
component_id
plugin_id
operation_id
```

This allows an operator to move from:

```text
Alert
  ↓
Health State
  ↓
Trace
  ↓
Logs
  ↓
Diagnostics
```

without manually reconstructing unrelated evidence.

---

## Vendor Neutrality

FamilyOS MUST NOT require a specific monitoring or alerting vendor at the architectural level.

The preferred model is:

```text
FamilyOS Components
        │
        ▼
Health / Diagnostic / Alert Contracts
        │
        ▼
FamilyOS Observability Layer
        │
        ▼
Adapter
        │
        ├── Local
        ├── Test
        └── External Platform
```

External systems remain replaceable.

---

## Local Development

Health and diagnostics MUST remain useful during local development.

A developer should be able to inspect basic component health without deploying a complete monitoring platform.

The initial implementation may provide:

```text
in-memory health registry
local diagnostic output
test alert collector
```

This supports development and automated testing.

---

## Testability

Health behavior SHOULD be deterministic enough for automated tests.

Tests may verify:

* healthy state;
* degraded state;
* unhealthy state;
* unknown state;
* dependency classification;
* aggregation;
* diagnostic filtering;
* alert generation;
* alert recovery;
* correlation metadata.

Tests SHOULD NOT require external monitoring infrastructure.

---

## Plugin Compliance

Future Plugin Compliance rules MAY verify that applicable plugins:

* expose required health information;
* correctly classify required dependencies;
* use standard health states;
* protect diagnostic information;
* participate in correlation;
* avoid direct vendor coupling.

Not every plugin requires every health or diagnostic capability.

Requirements should remain proportional to plugin behavior.

---

## Automation

Standardized health and alert contracts enable future automation.

Potential consumers include:

* startup verification;
* release validation;
* deployment checks;
* automated recovery;
* incident classification;
* plugin isolation;
* dependency failover;
* operational quality gates.

Automation SHOULD consume structured state rather than parse human-readable messages.

---

## Minimal Initial Implementation

FamilyOS SHOULD initially implement only the essential mechanisms.

A suitable first target is:

```text
HealthStatus
     +
HealthCheckResult
     +
HealthRegistry
     +
Basic Diagnostics
     +
Alert Condition Model
     +
In-Memory Test Support
```

A complete monitoring or incident-management system is not required by EPIC-OBS-001.

---

## Evolution Path

The expected progression is:

```text
Health Contracts
       ↓
Health Checks
       ↓
Health Aggregation
       ↓
Basic Diagnostics
       ↓
Alert Conditions
       ↓
Alert Lifecycle
       ↓
External Integrations
       ↓
Operational Automation
```

Complexity should only be introduced when concrete operational requirements justify it.

---

## Success Criteria

This part of the Observability Framework is successful when FamilyOS can:

* represent health consistently;
* distinguish healthy, degraded, unhealthy, and unknown states;
* evaluate component and dependency health;
* aggregate health deterministically;
* expose controlled diagnostics;
* protect sensitive diagnostic information;
* define actionable alert conditions;
* distinguish alerts from logs;
* detect recovery;
* correlate health, diagnostics, and other telemetry;
* test these mechanisms without external infrastructure.

---

## Conclusion

Health, diagnostics, and alerting extend FamilyOS observability beyond telemetry collection.

Together they establish a progression from detection to understanding and action:

```text
Runtime Behavior
       ↓
Observability Signals
       ↓
Health
       ↓
Condition Detection
       ↓
Alert
       ↓
Diagnostics
       ↓
Understanding
       ↓
Action
```

The governing principle is:

> Health describes operational capability, diagnostics explain operational conditions, and alerts identify conditions that require action.

These capabilities prepare FamilyOS for reliable runtime operation while keeping the initial implementation intentionally lightweight.
