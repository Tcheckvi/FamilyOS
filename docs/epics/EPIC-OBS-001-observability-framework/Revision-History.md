# EPIC-OBS-001 — Observability Framework Revision History

## Document Purpose

This document records the evolution of **EPIC-OBS-001 — Observability Framework**.

It preserves the historical publication of version `4.9.0` while documenting the later normalization of the repository into the current FamilyOS EPIC control model.

The revision history distinguishes between:

* historical framework publication;
* historical compact documentation structure;
* immutable release identity;
* later control-document normalization;
* current repository revalidation;
* future framework evolution.

## 1. Revision Principles

The Observability Framework revision history follows several foundational principles.

### Historical Integrity

Historical publication state SHALL remain identifiable and immutable.

The release tag:

```text id="rh1obs"
v4.9.0-observability-framework
```

SHALL remain attached to:

```text id="rh2obs"
5cb395e5beb973a4b6595eae0f3cb75142261dd7
```

Later normalization commits SHALL NOT replace that historical publication identity.

---

### Explicit Evolution

Material changes to the Observability Framework SHOULD remain traceable.

This includes changes affecting:

* observability principles;
* telemetry architecture;
* logging;
* metrics;
* tracing;
* health;
* readiness;
* diagnostics;
* alerting;
* correlation;
* privacy;
* security;
* governance;
* implementation;
* automation;
* validation;
* release integration.

---

### Evidence-Based Validation

Validation state SHALL follow evidence.

A requirement SHALL NOT be marked `PASS` merely because it is documented.

The expected sequence is:

```text id="rh3obs"
Execute
    ↓
Observe
    ↓
Evaluate
    ↓
Record
```

---

### Structural Truth

The repository history SHALL preserve the difference between:

```text id="rh4obs"
Historical Published Structure
```

and:

```text id="rh5obs"
Current Normalized Structure
```

The current seven control documents SHALL NOT be retroactively attributed to the historical version `4.9.0` publication.

---

## 2. Framework Version

The historically published Observability Framework version is:

```text id="rh6obs"
4.9.0
```

This version is part of the historical framework identity.

Post-release repository normalization does not by itself require a new semantic framework version when the normative numbered framework content remains unchanged.

---

## 3. Framework Version vs Repository History

Framework version:

```text id="rh7obs"
4.9.0
```

Historical release tag:

```text id="rh8obs"
v4.9.0-observability-framework
```

Historical release commit:

```text id="rh9obs"
5cb395e5beb973a4b6595eae0f3cb75142261dd7
```

A later repository-normalization commit may have a different Git identity while the framework remains version `4.9.0`.

---

## 4. Historical Documentation Model

The original Observability Framework used the compact FamilyOS framework documentation model.

Historical structure:

```text id="rh10ob"
Canonical Range:       00 → 09
Numbered Documents:    10
Control Documents:      0
Historical Files:      10
```

The historical release therefore consisted only of the ten numbered framework documents.

---

## 5. Historical Numbered Documents

The historical release contained:

```text id="rh11ob"
00-EPIC.md
01-Context-and-Vision.md
02-Observability-Principles.md
03-Observability-Architecture.md
04-Logging-Metrics-and-Tracing.md
05-Health-Diagnostics-and-Alerting.md
06-Observability-Data-and-Correlation.md
07-Security-Privacy-and-Governance.md
08-Implementation-and-Automation.md
09-Validation-and-Release.md
```

These documents form the historical normative framework baseline.

---

## 6. Historical Publication

EPIC-OBS-001 version `4.9.0` was historically published under:

```text id="rh12ob"
v4.9.0-observability-framework
```

Historical publication commit:

```text id="rh13ob"
5cb395e5beb973a4b6595eae0f3cb75142261dd7
```

Historical publication status:

```text id="rh14ob"
Published
```

Historical tag policy:

```text id="rh15ob"
Immutable
```

---

## 7. Historical Tag Evidence

The historical tag exists as an annotated Git tag.

Its dereferenced target is:

```text id="rh16ob"
5cb395e5beb973a4b6595eae0f3cb75142261dd7
```

The authoritative remote SHALL be rechecked during current post-release revalidation.

This relationship SHALL remain unchanged through normalization.

---

## 8. Historical Tag Immutability

Post-release normalization SHALL NOT:

* move `v4.9.0-observability-framework`;
* delete and recreate it on another commit;
* force-update it;
* rewrite the publication commit;
* claim a later normalization commit as the original release;
* reinterpret later control documents as historical release content.

---

## 9. Observability Framework Foundation

Version `4.9.0` established the canonical FamilyOS Observability Framework.

The release defines:

* Observability Principles;
* Observability Architecture;
* Logging;
* Metrics;
* Tracing;
* Structured Events;
* Health;
* Readiness;
* Liveness;
* Diagnostics;
* Alerting;
* Observability Data;
* Correlation;
* Security;
* Privacy;
* Governance;
* Implementation;
* Automation;
* Validation;
* Release Integration.

---

## 10. Observability Principles Revision

Version `4.9.0` establishes principles including:

```text id="rh17ob"
Useful Before Extensive
Structured Before Free-Form
Correlatable by Default
Context-Rich
Privacy-Aware
Security-Aware
Failure-Visible
Health-Explicit
Vendor-Neutral
Testable
Automatable
Proportional
Operationally Actionable
```

These principles represent the foundational observability posture.

---

## 11. Structured Telemetry Revision

The framework establishes structured telemetry as the preferred model where practical.

Structured telemetry supports:

* filtering;
* aggregation;
* correlation;
* automation;
* testing;
* validation;
* portability.

Free-form text may supplement structured fields.

---

## 12. Correlation Revision

Version `4.9.0` establishes correlation as a first-class capability.

Potential correlation identifiers include:

```text id="rh18ob"
correlation_id
trace_id
span_id
request_id
operation_id
job_id
release_id
```

Related signals SHOULD remain reconstructable into a meaningful execution story.

---

## 13. Context Revision

Telemetry SHOULD contain sufficient context to explain observed behavior.

Useful context may include:

* component;
* operation;
* outcome;
* duration;
* timestamp;
* correlation;
* version;
* environment;
* plugin;
* release.

Context SHALL remain proportional and privacy-aware.

---

## 14. Privacy Revision

Observability is explicitly privacy-aware.

Telemetry SHOULD avoid unnecessary exposure of:

* personal information;
* family-private information;
* protected document contents;
* credentials;
* secrets;
* tokens;
* cryptographic material.

---

## 15. Security Revision

Observability may provide important security evidence.

Examples include:

* authentication failures;
* authorization failures;
* denied operations;
* policy failures;
* anomalous behavior;
* release-integrity failures.

Telemetry itself SHALL remain subject to security controls.

---

## 16. Observability Architecture Revision

Version `4.9.0` establishes a layered architecture.

Conceptually:

```text id="rh19ob"
Application / Plugin / Service
            ↓
Observability API
            ↓
Canonical Telemetry Model
            ↓
Processing / Enrichment
            ↓
Exporter / Sink
            ↓
Logs / Metrics / Traces / Events
            ↓
Analysis / Diagnostics / Alerting
```

This architecture separates application semantics from vendor-specific telemetry infrastructure.

---

## 17. Vendor-Neutrality Revision

The framework establishes vendor neutrality as an architectural expectation.

Core application components SHOULD avoid direct dependency on one telemetry backend where practical.

Adapters MAY connect FamilyOS abstractions to external systems.

---

## 18. Logging Revision

Logging guidance covers:

* structure;
* severity;
* context;
* outcome;
* correlation;
* privacy;
* security.

Logging SHALL NOT become an uncontrolled persistence mechanism for arbitrary FamilyOS domain data.

---

## 19. Log Severity Revision

Representative log severities may include:

```text id="rh20ob"
TRACE
DEBUG
INFO
WARNING
ERROR
CRITICAL
```

Severity SHOULD communicate operational significance.

---

## 20. Metrics Revision

Version `4.9.0` establishes canonical metric guidance.

Metrics may represent:

* operation count;
* failure count;
* latency;
* retries;
* queue depth;
* resource usage;
* plugin activity;
* deployment duration;
* rollback activity.

---

## 21. Metric Cardinality Revision

The framework explicitly recognizes metric cardinality as an operational concern.

Potentially dangerous dimensions include:

* unrestricted user IDs;
* arbitrary document IDs;
* random identifiers;
* raw URLs;
* free-form exception messages.

Dimensions SHOULD remain bounded where practical.

---

## 22. Tracing Revision

Tracing represents causal and temporal relationships between operations.

Conceptually:

```text id="rh21ob"
Trace
 ├── Span A
 │    ├── Span B
 │    └── Span C
 └── Span D
```

Tracing SHOULD support diagnosis across FamilyOS layers without unnecessary vendor coupling.

---

## 23. Span Revision

A span may contain:

* operation name;
* parent relationship;
* start time;
* end time;
* duration;
* status;
* attributes;
* events;
* failure details.

Span attributes SHALL remain security- and privacy-aware.

---

## 24. Event Revision

Structured events may represent significant operational transitions.

Examples include:

```text id="rh22ob"
familyos.capability.started
familyos.capability.completed
familyos.capability.failed
migration.completed
deployment.completed
rollback.completed
```

Stable event names improve automation, testing, and diagnosis.

---

## 25. Health Revision

Version `4.9.0` establishes explicit health semantics.

Potential states may include:

```text id="rh23ob"
HEALTHY
DEGRADED
UNHEALTHY
UNKNOWN
```

Health SHOULD communicate meaningful operational status.

---

## 26. Readiness Revision

Readiness is distinct from process existence.

A component may be running but unable to perform intended work because:

* initialization is incomplete;
* mandatory dependencies are unavailable;
* configuration is invalid;
* migrations are pending;
* required secrets are unavailable.

---

## 27. Liveness Revision

Liveness indicates whether a process or subsystem remains alive enough to continue execution.

Liveness SHALL NOT automatically imply readiness or full health.

---

## 28. Diagnostics Revision

The framework establishes diagnostics as a deeper troubleshooting capability.

Diagnostics may expose:

* subsystem state;
* dependency status;
* plugin status;
* initialization state;
* queue state;
* recent failures;
* correlation information.

Diagnostics SHALL avoid unnecessary secret or private-data exposure.

---

## 29. Alerting Revision

Alerts SHOULD correspond to meaningful, actionable conditions.

Alerting guidance includes:

* severity;
* context;
* ownership;
* routing;
* noise reduction;
* duplication;
* recoverability.

---

## 30. Alert Ownership Revision

Alerts SHOULD have identifiable ownership or routing expectations.

Unowned alerts create ambiguity and reduce operational usefulness.

---

## 31. Observability Data Revision

Version `4.9.0` establishes observability data as governed operational data.

It may include:

* logs;
* metric samples;
* traces;
* events;
* health records;
* diagnostics;
* alerts.

---

## 32. Time Revision

Telemetry relies on coherent time representation.

Systems SHOULD account for:

* asynchronous execution;
* buffering;
* delayed export;
* distributed processing;
* clock skew.

---

## 33. Retention Revision

Telemetry retention SHOULD remain proportional to:

* diagnostic value;
* privacy;
* security;
* legal requirements;
* storage cost;
* operational need.

---

## 34. Data Minimization Revision

Observability SHOULD capture only information necessary for legitimate operational purposes.

Telemetry SHALL NOT become a secondary uncontrolled copy of FamilyOS domain data.

---

## 35. Secret Protection Revision

Secrets SHALL NOT intentionally appear in telemetry.

Examples include:

```text id="rh24ob"
Passwords
API Keys
Bearer Tokens
Private Keys
Encryption Keys
Signing Keys
Authentication Cookies
```

Redaction may provide defense in depth but SHALL NOT replace safe instrumentation.

---

## 36. Governance Revision

Version `4.9.0` establishes observability governance covering:

* naming;
* schemas;
* ownership;
* retention;
* access;
* privacy;
* security;
* alerting;
* metric dimensions;
* correlation.

---

## 37. Implementation Revision

The framework provides implementation direction without binding FamilyOS to one telemetry vendor.

Potential abstractions include:

```text id="rh25ob"
Logger
Meter
Tracer
EventEmitter
HealthReporter
DiagnosticProvider
CorrelationContext
TelemetryExporter
```

Exact implementation remains an engineering concern.

---

## 38. Automation Revision

Observability automation may validate:

* telemetry schemas;
* required fields;
* event names;
* metric registration;
* trace propagation;
* health behavior;
* privacy constraints;
* alert rules.

Automation SHOULD expose failures explicitly.

---

## 39. Testing Boundary Revision

EPIC-TST-001 remains authoritative for general testing architecture.

EPIC-OBS-001 defines observability-specific testing expectations.

---

## 40. Quality Boundary Revision

EPIC-QLT-001 remains authoritative for general quality governance.

Observability may provide evidence including:

* latency;
* failure rates;
* operational regressions;
* reliability trends;
* diagnostic findings.

---

## 41. Build Boundary Revision

EPIC-BLD-001 remains authoritative for build engineering.

Observability may instrument build activities but SHALL NOT redefine the build lifecycle.

---

## 42. Release Boundary Revision

EPIC-REL-001 remains authoritative for release engineering.

Observability may supply deployment, rollback, publication, and verification telemetry.

---

## 43. Security Boundary Revision

EPIC-SEC-001 remains authoritative for security architecture and security policy.

Observability supplies security-relevant signals but SHALL NOT redefine the Security Framework.

---

## 44. Historical Validation State

The historical numbered framework contains pre-publication states such as:

```text id="rh26ob"
Implementation Status: Pending
Framework Status: Ready for Final Validation
PENDING
```

These states belong to the historical release workflow.

They SHALL NOT automatically be interpreted as the current normalized control-layer state.

---

## 45. Historical `00-EPIC.md` State

The historical `00-EPIC.md` records:

```text id="rh27ob"
Predecessor Release: v4.8.0-release-framework
Implementation Status: Pending
Framework Status: Ready for Final Validation
```

These statements represent the state of the numbered framework at historical publication time.

They are preserved as historical evidence.

---

## 46. Historical `09-Validation-and-Release.md` State

The historical validation document includes:

* validation-state models;
* `PENDING` examples;
* placeholder examples;
* release-preparation instructions.

Such material SHALL be interpreted contextually.

It SHALL NOT automatically determine the current normalized repository state.

---

## 47. Historical Release Completion

Version `4.9.0` was historically completed and published under:

```text id="rh28ob"
v4.9.0-observability-framework
```

The tag resolves to:

```text id="rh29ob"
5cb395e5beb973a4b6595eae0f3cb75142261dd7
```

The framework is therefore historically published.

---

## 48. Post-Release Governance Evolution

After publication, the FamilyOS framework-governance model evolved.

Later normalized frameworks use seven standard control documents:

```text id="rh30ob"
EPIC-<ID>.md
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

EPIC-OBS-001 did not contain this control layer in its historical publication.

---

## 49. Post-Release Normalization

The current normalization adds:

```text id="rh31ob"
EPIC-OBS-001.md
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

These documents improve:

* machine-readable metadata;
* repository inventory;
* navigation;
* validation evidence;
* revision tracking;
* historical-state clarity;
* lifecycle visibility.

---

## 50. Current Repository Structure

The normalized repository contains:

```text id="rh32ob"
10 numbered documents
+
7 control documents
=
17 canonical files
```

Current canonical range remains:

```text id="rh33ob"
00 → 09
```

---

## 51. Historical vs Current Structure

Historical release:

```text id="rh34ob"
Numbered Documents: 10
Control Documents:    0
Historical Files:    10
```

Current normalized repository:

```text id="rh35ob"
Numbered Documents: 10
Control Documents:    7
Canonical Files:     17
```

The current state SHALL NOT be retroactively attributed to the historical publication.

---

## 52. Machine-Readable Normalization

The current normalization introduces:

```text id="rh36ob"
EPIC.yaml
```

as the machine-readable framework contract.

It records:

* EPIC identity;
* framework version;
* deliverables;
* current structure;
* historical structure;
* publication identity;
* validation state;
* governance;
* closure state.

---

## 53. Manifest Normalization

The normalization introduces:

```text id="rh37ob"
MANIFEST.md
```

as the authoritative current repository inventory.

---

## 54. Validation Normalization

The normalization introduces:

```text id="rh38ob"
VALIDATION.md
```

as the authoritative record for current revalidation requirements and evidence.

It distinguishes historical publication evidence from current repository evidence.

---

## 55. Changelog Normalization

The normalization introduces:

```text id="rh39ob"
CHANGELOG.md
```

to preserve:

* historical version `4.9.0`;
* current repository normalization;
* future framework revisions.

---

## 56. README Normalization

The normalization introduces:

```text id="rh40ob"
README.md
```

as the human-readable navigation and orientation layer.

It does not replace the normative numbered framework documents.

---

## 57. EPIC Control Summary

The normalization introduces:

```text id="rh41ob"
EPIC-OBS-001.md
```

as the consolidated control-level summary.

---

## 58. Current Validation State

Current repository revalidation state:

```text id="rh42ob"
Repository Validation: Validated
Final Revalidation:     Validated
```

This state SHALL remain pending until actual repository validation evidence is recorded.

---

## 59. Current Revalidation Scope

Current revalidation includes:

```text id="rh43ob"
YAML Parse
YAML Contract
Filesystem Contract
Numbering Integrity
Control Document Integrity
Empty File Validation
Manifest Synchronization
README Synchronization
EPIC Summary Synchronization
Changelog Synchronization
Revision History Synchronization
State Consistency
Reference Integrity
Placeholder Validation
Join Defect Validation
Observability Principle Consistency
Observability Architecture Consistency
Vendor Neutrality
Logging Consistency
Metrics Consistency
Tracing Consistency
Health Consistency
Readiness Consistency
Liveness Consistency
Diagnostics Consistency
Alerting Consistency
Correlation Consistency
Security / Privacy Consistency
Governance Consistency
Framework Boundaries
Historical Tag Integrity
Ruff
MyPy
Pytest
Diff Check
Remote Branch Verification
Final Repository Cleanliness
```

---

## 60. Validation Evidence Policy

The required validation sequence is:

```text id="rh44ob"
Execute
    ↓
Observe
    ↓
Evaluate
    ↓
Record
```

Historical validation evidence does not automatically prove the current normalized repository state.

---

## 61. Historical Evidence Already Observed

The following historical evidence has already been observed:

```text id="rh45ob"
Historical Tag Exists:          PASS
Annotated Tag:                  PASS
Historical Commit Identified:   PASS
Historical File Count:          PASS — 10
Historical Control Count:       PASS — 0
Historical Publication Commit:  PASS
```

Remote tag integrity remains subject to final current revalidation.

---

## 62. Current Repository Evidence

Current repository validation evidence remains to be collected after all seven control documents are present and synchronized.

Until then:

```text id="rh46ob"
Repository Validation: Validated
Final Revalidation:     Validated
```

---

## 63. Revision Classification

Future Observability Framework changes may be classified as follows.

### Editorial

Examples:

* spelling;
* grammar;
* formatting;
* non-semantic clarification.

Typical semantic version impact:

```text id="rh47ob"
Usually none
```

---

### Repository Normalization

Examples:

* control-document addition;
* manifest synchronization;
* metadata synchronization;
* validation-record normalization;
* lifecycle-state correction.

Typical semantic version impact:

```text id="rh48ob"
Usually none
```

when normative observability semantics remain unchanged.

---

### Compatible Semantic Change

Examples:

* additional optional telemetry fields;
* compatible signal categories;
* compatible observability profiles;
* compatible health metadata.

Potential version impact:

```text id="rh49ob"
MINOR
```

subject to FamilyOS governance.

---

### Breaking Semantic Change

Examples:

* incompatible health semantics;
* incompatible correlation semantics;
* incompatible mandatory telemetry schemas;
* incompatible release-observability contract.

Potential version impact:

```text id="rh50ob"
MAJOR
```

subject to governance.

---

## 64. Historical State Policy

Historical lifecycle states may remain when clearly identified as historical.

Examples include:

```text id="rh51ob"
Implementation Status: Pending
Framework Status: Ready for Final Validation
PENDING
```

when they appear as part of the historical publication workflow or validation examples.

They SHALL NOT automatically be interpreted as active current repository states.

---

## 65. Current State Policy

Current control documents SHALL distinguish:

```text id="rh52ob"
Historical Framework Publication
```

from:

```text id="rh53ob"
Current Repository Revalidation
```

The historical publication is already complete.

Only current normalized repository revalidation remains pending.

---

## 66. Repository Completion Conditions

Current normalization becomes technically validated only when:

* all 17 canonical files exist;
* all 10 numbered documents remain present;
* numbered sequence remains exactly `00–09`;
* all 7 control documents exist;
* YAML parsing passes;
* filesystem contract passes;
* numbering passes;
* no canonical file is empty;
* manifest synchronization passes;
* references pass;
* placeholders are correctly classified;
* join defects are absent;
* observability semantic checks pass;
* historical tag integrity is re-confirmed;
* Ruff passes;
* MyPy passes;
* Pytest passes;
* `git diff --check` passes.

---

## 67. Post-Release Correction Conditions

The normalization workflow becomes fully complete when:

* normalization files are staged;
* staged content is validated;
* normalization commit is created;
* repository quality gates pass after commit;
* normalization commit is pushed;
* authoritative remote branch matches local HEAD;
* historical tag remains unchanged locally and remotely;
* working tree is clean.

---

## 68. Future Observability Framework Evolution

Future revisions may introduce:

* machine-readable telemetry schemas;
* signal registries;
* observability profiles;
* formal event schemas;
* formal health contracts;
* correlation schemas;
* alert-policy models;
* telemetry quality metrics;
* automated cardinality controls;
* runtime observability validation;
* richer release telemetry;
* privacy automation;
* observability governance automation.

Future revisions SHALL preserve historical version `4.9.0` publication evidence.

---

Historical publication evidence has been established.

Current normalized repository evidence remains pending.

The authoritative current validation evidence belongs in:

```text id="rh55ob"
VALIDATION.md
```

Until current evidence is complete, this revision history SHALL NOT claim final repository revalidation success.

## 71. Final Revision Principle

EPIC-OBS-001 version `4.9.0` established the canonical FamilyOS Observability Framework.

Its historical publication consists of:

```text id="rh56ob"
10 numbered documents
0 control documents
10 historical files
```

under:

```text id="rh57ob"
v4.9.0-observability-framework
```

at:

```text id="rh58ob"
5cb395e5beb973a4b6595eae0f3cb75142261dd7
```

The current repository normalization adds seven control documents without rewriting that history.

Future framework evolution SHALL preserve:

* structured telemetry;
* useful telemetry;
* stable correlation;
* explicit health;
* reliable diagnostics;
* actionable alerts;
* privacy awareness;
* security awareness;
* vendor neutrality;
* testability;
* historical release integrity.
