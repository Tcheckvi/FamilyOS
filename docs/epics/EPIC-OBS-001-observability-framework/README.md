# Observability Framework

## EPIC-OBS-001

### Overview

The **FamilyOS Observability Framework** defines the canonical observability foundation for FamilyOS engineering, plugins, services, automation, release processes, and future runtime operations.

It establishes observability as a permanent engineering capability rather than an optional production concern.

The framework connects observability across the complete FamilyOS lifecycle:

```text
Architecture
    ↓
Implementation
    ↓
Testing
    ↓
Build
    ↓
Release
    ↓
Runtime Operation
    ↓
Observation
    ↓
Diagnosis
    ↓
Improvement
```

The framework is defined by:

```text
EPIC-OBS-001
```

and maintained under:

```text
docs/epics/EPIC-OBS-001-observability-framework/
```

---

## Purpose

The purpose of the Observability Framework is to ensure that FamilyOS behavior remains:

* visible;
* measurable;
* diagnosable;
* correlatable;
* explainable;
* privacy-aware;
* security-aware;
* testable;
* automatable;
* vendor-neutral;
* operationally actionable.

Observability SHOULD provide sufficient evidence to understand system behavior without requiring invasive production debugging.

---

## Core Principle

The central principle of the Observability Framework is:

> FamilyOS behavior should be observable through structured, correlatable, contextual, privacy-aware, and operationally useful signals.

Observability SHALL NOT depend exclusively on:

* free-form logs;
* manual debugging;
* production-only tooling;
* vendor-specific telemetry APIs;
* undocumented naming conventions;
* uncorrelated signals;
* arbitrary metric dimensions.

---

## Why the Observability Framework Exists

FamilyOS may progressively contain:

* command-line applications;
* services;
* plugins;
* automation;
* scheduled jobs;
* external integrations;
* background processing;
* release pipelines;
* persistent data;
* security-sensitive operations;
* family-facing workflows.

Without a coherent observability model, individual components could independently define:

* logging;
* metric naming;
* traces;
* events;
* health;
* diagnostics;
* alerts;
* correlation;
* telemetry retention;
* privacy rules.

This could create incompatible telemetry and make failures difficult to investigate.

EPIC-OBS-001 provides a common observability model.

---

## Observability Responsibilities

The Observability Framework governs:

        ↓

        ↓

```

---

## Observability Principles

The framework establishes foundational principles including:

```text
Useful Before Extensive
Structured Before Free-Form
Correlatable by Default
Context-Rich
Privacy-Aware
Security-Aware
Failure-Visible
Health-Explicit
Vendor-Neutral
Testable
Automatable
Proportional
Operationally Actionable
```

These principles guide telemetry design, implementation, validation, and governance.

---

## Useful Before Extensive

More telemetry does not automatically create better observability.

Signals SHOULD answer meaningful questions.

Examples include:

* What failed?
* Where did it fail?
* When did it fail?
* Which component was involved?
* Which operation was executing?
* Which release was active?
* Was the failure transient?
* Which dependency was unavailable?
* Which correlated operations were affected?

Telemetry volume SHOULD remain subordinate to diagnostic usefulness.

---

## Structured Before Free-Form

Where practical, telemetry SHOULD use structured representations.

Structured telemetry improves:

* filtering;
* aggregation;
* correlation;
* validation;
* testing;
* machine processing;
* portability.

Human-readable descriptions may supplement structured fields.

---

## Correlatable by Default

Signals related to the same execution SHOULD be correlatable.

Possible identifiers include:

```text
correlation_id
trace_id
span_id
request_id
operation_id
job_id
release_id
```

Correlation allows separate signals to be reconstructed into a coherent execution story.

---

## Context-Rich Telemetry

Telemetry SHOULD contain sufficient context to explain what occurred.

Useful context may include:

* timestamp;
* component;
* operation;
* outcome;
* duration;
* version;
* environment;
* correlation identifier;
* plugin identity;
* release identity;
* error category.

Context SHALL remain proportional and privacy-aware.

---

## Privacy-Aware Observability

Telemetry SHALL NOT automatically record every available value.

FamilyOS observability SHOULD minimize unnecessary exposure of:

* personal information;
* family-private information;
* document contents;
* credentials;
* secrets;
* authentication tokens;
* encryption keys;
* private identifiers.

Observability data SHALL follow data-minimization principles.

---

## Security-Aware Observability

Observability may provide important security evidence.

Examples include:

* authentication failures;
* authorization failures;
* denied actions;
* policy violations;
* suspicious activity;
* configuration changes;
* release-integrity failures.

Security-sensitive telemetry SHALL itself be protected appropriately.

---

## Failure Visibility

Failures SHOULD be observable.

A failed operation SHOULD provide enough structured evidence to support diagnosis.

Useful failure information may include:

```text
component
operation
failure_type
outcome
correlation_id
retry_state
dependency
duration
```

Secrets or sensitive values SHALL NOT be exposed merely to improve diagnostics.

---

## Explicit Health

Health semantics SHALL be explicit.

The following concepts are not equivalent:

```text
RUNNING
READY
HEALTHY
LIVE
```

A process may be running while:

* initialization is incomplete;
* dependencies are unavailable;
* migrations are pending;
* required configuration is invalid;
* health is degraded.

---

## Observability Architecture

The framework establishes a layered observability architecture.

Conceptually:

```text
Application / Plugin / Service
            ↓
Canonical Observability API
            ↓
Telemetry Model
            ↓
Enrichment / Processing
            ↓
Exporters / Sinks
            ↓
Logs / Metrics / Traces / Events
            ↓
Analysis / Diagnostics / Alerting
```

Application behavior SHOULD remain decoupled from observability vendors.

---

## Observability APIs

Components SHOULD use stable FamilyOS observability abstractions.

Potential capabilities include:

```text
Logger
Meter
Tracer
EventEmitter
HealthReporter
DiagnosticProvider
CorrelationContext
TelemetryExporter
```

The exact implementation may evolve.

---

## Canonical Telemetry Model

A telemetry record may contain fields such as:

```text
timestamp
signal_type
event_name
component
operation
severity
outcome
duration
correlation_id
trace_id
span_id
version
environment
attributes
```

Not every field applies to every signal.

Schemas SHOULD remain extensible and governed.

---

## Logging

Logging records significant discrete events.

Logs SHOULD normally be:

* structured;
* severity-aware;
* contextual;
* correlatable;
* privacy-aware.

Logging SHOULD NOT become an uncontrolled persistence mechanism for arbitrary application data.

---

## Log Severity

Typical severity levels may include:

```text
TRACE
DEBUG
INFO
WARNING
ERROR
CRITICAL
```

Severity SHOULD represent operational significance.

---

## Metrics

Metrics represent measurable characteristics over time.

Examples include:

* operation count;
* failure count;
* latency;
* retry count;
* queue depth;
* active operations;
* resource usage;
* plugin activity;
* deployment duration;
* rollback count.

Metric semantics SHOULD remain stable.

---

## Metric Naming

Metrics SHOULD use consistent naming.

A metric name should clearly communicate:

* subject;
* measurement;
* unit where appropriate.

Unstable metric names reduce long-term usefulness.

---

## Metric Dimensions

Metric dimensions enable grouping and filtering.

Dimensions SHOULD remain bounded.

Potentially dangerous high-cardinality values include:

* unrestricted user IDs;
* arbitrary document IDs;
* raw URLs;
* random identifiers;
* complete exception messages.

Cardinality SHALL be managed deliberately.

---

## Tracing

Tracing represents execution relationships across operations.

A trace may consist of multiple spans:

```text
Trace
 ├── Span A
 │    ├── Span B
 │    └── Span C
 └── Span D
```

Tracing can provide causal context across services, plugins, and internal layers.

---

## Span Model

A span may contain:

* operation name;
* parent relationship;
* start time;
* end time;
* duration;
* status;
* attributes;
* events;
* error classification.

Span attributes SHALL respect security and privacy requirements.

---

## Events

Structured events represent significant transitions.

Examples include:

```text
familyos.capability.started
familyos.capability.completed
familyos.capability.failed
migration.completed
deployment.completed
rollback.completed
```

Event naming SHOULD remain stable and governed.

---

## Event Semantics

Events SHOULD communicate what happened rather than reproduce arbitrary log messages.

A stable event may be consumed by:

* diagnostics;
* analytics;
* testing;
* monitoring;
* automation;
* security;
* release verification.

---

## Health

Health represents whether a component is functioning adequately.

Possible states may include:

```text
HEALTHY
DEGRADED
UNHEALTHY
UNKNOWN
```

Exact semantics SHALL be explicit.

---

## Readiness

Readiness indicates whether a component is able to perform intended work.

Examples of non-ready states include:

* initialization incomplete;
* mandatory dependency unavailable;
* migration incomplete;
* configuration invalid;
* required secret unavailable.

Readiness SHALL NOT be inferred solely from process existence.

---

## Liveness

Liveness indicates whether a process or subsystem remains alive enough to continue operating.

Liveness does not prove readiness or health.

---

## Diagnostics

Diagnostics provide deeper troubleshooting information.

Potential diagnostic information includes:

* dependency status;
* plugin status;
* initialization state;
* queue status;
* recent failure categories;
* configuration summaries;
* correlation state;
* subsystem health.

Diagnostics SHALL avoid exposing unnecessary sensitive information.

---

## Alerting

Alerts identify conditions requiring attention.

An effective alert SHOULD be:

* actionable;
* meaningful;
* sufficiently contextual;
* appropriately prioritized;
* resistant to excessive noise.

Alert quantity SHOULD NOT be used as a proxy for observability quality.

---

## Alert Severity

Alert severity may consider:

* user impact;
* service impact;
* data impact;
* security impact;
* release impact;
* urgency;
* recoverability.

Severity semantics SHOULD remain explicit.

---

## Alert Ownership

An alert SHOULD have identifiable ownership or routing expectations.

Unowned alerts commonly become ignored alerts.

---

## Observability Data

Observability data includes:

* logs;
* metric samples;
* traces;
* events;
* health records;
* diagnostics;
* alerts.

Telemetry itself becomes governed operational data.

---

## Correlation

Correlation connects related telemetry.

Conceptually:

```text
Operation
   ↓
Correlation Context
   ↓
Logs
Metrics
Traces
Events
Diagnostics
```

Correlation SHOULD enable engineers to follow execution across layers.

---

## Correlation Propagation

Correlation context may need to propagate through:

* function calls;
* services;
* plugins;
* jobs;
* queues;
* external integrations.

Propagation SHALL remain explicit where boundaries make implicit propagation unreliable.

---

## Time

Reliable timestamps are critical.

Telemetry SHOULD use consistent timestamp conventions.

Systems SHOULD account for:

* asynchronous processing;
* buffering;
* delayed export;
* clock skew;
* distributed execution.

---

## Retention

Observability data SHOULD not be retained indefinitely by default.

Retention decisions SHOULD consider:

* diagnostic usefulness;
* legal requirements;
* privacy;
* security;
* cost;
* operational need.

---

## Data Minimization

Telemetry SHOULD contain only information required for legitimate observability purposes.

Observability SHALL NOT become a secondary uncontrolled replica of FamilyOS domain data.

---

## Security and Privacy

Observability intersects directly with Security.

Telemetry may reveal:

* architecture;
* component identities;
* operational patterns;
* error details;
* user behavior;
* release state.

The framework therefore incorporates:

* access control;
* minimization;
* retention;
* redaction;
* secret protection;
* governance.

---

## Secret Protection

Secrets SHALL NOT intentionally appear in telemetry.

Examples include:

```text
Passwords
API Keys
Bearer Tokens
Private Keys
Encryption Keys
Signing Keys
Authentication Cookies
```

Redaction mechanisms MAY provide defense in depth.

They SHALL NOT replace safe telemetry design.

---

## Sensitive Data

FamilyOS may process sensitive personal or family information.

Telemetry SHOULD avoid capturing such content unless it is genuinely necessary and appropriately governed.

---

## Observability Governance

Governance defines rules for:

* signal naming;
* schemas;
* ownership;
* retention;
* access;
* privacy;
* security;
* alert management;
* metric dimensions;
* correlation;
* lifecycle changes.

Governance prevents telemetry fragmentation.

---

## Implementation

The framework remains technology-neutral.

Potential implementation components may include:

```text
ObservabilityProvider
Logger
MetricRecorder
Tracer
EventPublisher
HealthRegistry
DiagnosticRegistry
CorrelationContext
TelemetryProcessor
Exporter
```

Adapters may integrate these abstractions with external telemetry systems.

---

## Automation

Observability validation may be automated.

Examples include:

* schema checks;
* required-field checks;
* metric registration checks;
* trace propagation checks;
* event-name validation;
* sensitive-data checks;
* alert-rule validation;
* health-state testing.

Automation SHOULD produce explicit evidence.

---

## Testing

Observability behavior SHOULD be testable without production infrastructure.

Tests may verify:

* structured log fields;
* metric changes;
* emitted events;
* trace relationships;
* correlation propagation;
* health transitions;
* diagnostic behavior;
* privacy constraints.

EPIC-TST-001 remains authoritative for general testing architecture.

---

## Quality Integration

EPIC-QLT-001 remains authoritative for the Quality Framework.

Observability may provide evidence such as:

* failure rates;
* latency trends;
* reliability trends;
* operational regressions;
* diagnostic evidence.

---

## Build Integration

EPIC-BLD-001 remains authoritative for build engineering.

Observability may expose:

* build duration;
* dependency-resolution failures;
* build-stage diagnostics;
* artifact production outcomes.

---

## Release Integration

EPIC-REL-001 remains authoritative for release engineering.

Observability may provide release evidence regarding:

```text
deployment.started
deployment.completed
deployment.failed
rollback.started
rollback.completed
release.verification.failed
```

Release telemetry SHOULD remain correlated with release identity.

---

## Security Integration

EPIC-SEC-001 remains authoritative for Security.

Security may consume observability signals for:

* authentication monitoring;
* authorization monitoring;
* anomaly detection;
* investigation;
* runtime policy evidence.

Observability data SHALL respect Security Framework requirements.

---

## Framework Boundaries

EPIC-OBS-001 owns:

* observability semantics;
* logging;
* metrics;
* tracing;
* structured events;
* health;
* diagnostics;
* alerting;
* telemetry correlation;
* observability-data governance.

It does not own:

* general testing architecture;
* general quality governance;
* build lifecycle;
* release lifecycle;
* security architecture;
* general operations architecture.

---

## Canonical Numbered Documents

The historical Observability Framework consists of exactly ten numbered documents:

```text
00-EPIC.md
01-Context-and-Vision.md
02-Observability-Principles.md
03-Observability-Architecture.md
04-Logging-Metrics-and-Tracing.md
05-Health-Diagnostics-and-Alerting.md
06-Observability-Data-and-Correlation.md
07-Security-Privacy-and-Governance.md
08-Implementation-and-Automation.md
09-Validation-and-Release.md
```

Canonical numbered range:

```text
00 → 09
```

Numbered-document count:

```text
10
```

---

## Control Documents

The normalized current repository representation adds seven control documents:

```text
EPIC-OBS-001.md
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

Control-document count:

```text
7
```

---

## Current Canonical Repository Structure

The normalized structure is:

```text
10 numbered documents
+
7 control documents
=
17 canonical files
```

Canonical structure:

```text
Canonical Range:       00 → 09
Numbered Documents:    10
Control Documents:      7
Canonical Files:       17
```

---

## Historical Structure

The historical publication used the earlier compact documentation model.

Historical structure:

```text
Numbered Documents: 10
Control Documents:    0
Historical Files:    10
```

The seven control documents added later SHALL NOT be represented as having existed at historical publication time.

---

## Historical Publication

Framework version:

```text
4.9.0
```

Historical tag:

```text
v4.9.0-observability-framework
```

Historical publication commit:

```text
5cb395e5beb973a4b6595eae0f3cb75142261dd7
```

Historical publication status:

```text
Published
```

Historical tag policy:

```text
Immutable
```

---

## Post-Release Normalization

The current repository activity introduces the standard FamilyOS EPIC control-document layer.

Normalization adds:

* machine-readable metadata;
* canonical repository inventory;
* validation evidence;
* revision history;
* changelog;
* navigation;
* explicit lifecycle state.

Normalization does not redefine the historical framework release.

---

## Revalidation

The normalized repository representation must be revalidated before its current control state may be considered fully validated.

Required validation includes:

* YAML parsing;
* filesystem inventory;
* numbering integrity;
* control-document integrity;
* empty-file validation;
* manifest synchronization;
* reference integrity;
* placeholder validation;
* join-defect validation;
* observability semantic consistency;
* historical tag integrity;
* Ruff;
* MyPy;
* Pytest;
* repository diff validation.

---

## Evidence Policy

Validation SHALL follow:

```text
Execute
    ↓
Observe
    ↓
Evaluate
    ↓
Record
```

A requirement SHALL NOT be marked PASS merely because it is documented.

Only actual validation evidence may establish successful revalidation.

---

## Final Principle

The FamilyOS Observability Framework is based on the following principle:

> FamilyOS should produce structured, correlatable, privacy-aware, operationally useful evidence sufficient to explain its behavior from development through release and runtime operation.

Historical publication is preserved exactly as it occurred.

Current governance normalization adds control and validation evidence around that historical framework without rewriting its release identity.
