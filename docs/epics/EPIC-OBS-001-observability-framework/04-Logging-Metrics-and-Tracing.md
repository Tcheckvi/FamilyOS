# Observability Framework

## EPIC-OBS-001

## 04 Logging, Metrics, and Tracing

### Overview

Logging, metrics, and tracing are the three primary telemetry capabilities used by the FamilyOS Observability Framework to explain runtime behavior.

Each capability serves a different purpose.

Logs provide detailed event records.

Metrics provide quantitative measurements over time.

Traces provide execution context across component boundaries.

Together, they create a complementary observability model.

The governing principle is:

> FamilyOS must use logs, metrics, and traces as coordinated signals rather than isolated telemetry systems.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to define the FamilyOS model for:

* structured logging;
* application metrics;
* operational metrics;
* distributed tracing;
* context propagation;
* signal correlation;
* naming conventions;
* severity;
* dimensions;
* sampling;
* cardinality;
* retention;
* security;
* privacy;
* plugin integration;
* release correlation;
* validation.

The objective is to ensure that runtime signals remain consistent, actionable, and safe across the complete FamilyOS platform.

---

## Signal Model

The three primary observability signals provide different views of runtime behavior.

```text
Logs
 |
 +--> What happened?

Metrics
 |
 +--> How much, how often, or how long?

Traces
 |
 +--> How did the operation flow through the system?
```

These signals should be designed to complement one another.

---

## Signal Relationship

A single runtime operation may generate all three signals.

```text
Operation
   |
   +--> Metric
   |     operation_count += 1
   |
   +--> Log
   |     operation.completed
   |
   +--> Trace
         span duration and dependencies
```

This enables both high-level monitoring and detailed diagnosis.

---

## Logging

Logging records discrete runtime events.

FamilyOS logging should be:

* structured;
* contextual;
* consistent;
* attributable;
* secure;
* privacy-aware.

Production logging should not rely primarily on free-form console output.

---

## Structured Logging

Structured logs represent event information using stable fields.

Conceptually:

```text
timestamp
severity
event
service
component
operation
result
correlation_id
release_version
context
```

Structured logs improve:

* filtering;
* aggregation;
* correlation;
* automated analysis;
* alerting.

---

## Log Event Naming

Log events should use stable semantic names.

Examples include:

```text
plugin.loaded
plugin.execution.failed
release.deployment.started
configuration.loaded
dependency.timeout
migration.completed
```

Event names should describe what occurred rather than contain arbitrary human prose.

---

## Log Messages

Structured event names should be accompanied by concise human-readable messages where useful.

For example:

```text
event = plugin.execution.failed

message =
Communication plugin operation failed while sending message.
```

The message improves operator readability.

The event name supports machine processing.

---

## Logging Severity

FamilyOS should use a common severity model.

Recommended levels are:

```text
DEBUG
INFO
WARNING
ERROR
CRITICAL
```

Severity must have consistent semantics.

---

## DEBUG

`DEBUG` is intended for detailed diagnostic information.

Examples include:

* internal decision paths;
* detailed initialization state;
* local development diagnostics.

DEBUG telemetry may be disabled or sampled heavily in production.

---

## INFO

`INFO` represents expected significant runtime activity.

Examples include:

* service startup;
* plugin activation;
* migration completion;
* deployment completion;
* scheduled operation completion.

INFO should not be used for every trivial internal operation.

---

## WARNING

`WARNING` represents abnormal behavior that does not yet constitute complete failure.

Examples include:

* degraded dependency;
* retry condition;
* optional plugin unavailable;
* approaching capacity threshold.

Warnings should support operational awareness.

---

## ERROR

`ERROR` indicates an operation failed or produced an unacceptable result.

Examples include:

* failed request;
* plugin operation failure;
* dependency timeout;
* failed background task.

Errors should include enough context for diagnosis.

---

## CRITICAL

`CRITICAL` indicates severe platform or security impact.

Examples include:

* core service unavailable;
* persistent data integrity failure;
* unrecoverable initialization failure;
* critical security control failure.

CRITICAL events should be rare and operationally actionable.

---

## Exception Logging

Exceptions must be logged carefully.

A useful exception record may include:

```text
exception_type
operation
component
message
correlation_id
trace_id
release_version
```

Stack traces may be included when appropriate.

Sensitive information must be removed before storage or export.

---

## Duplicate Exception Logging

The same exception should not be repeatedly logged at every architectural layer without additional value.

For example:

```text
Repository logs exception
Service logs same exception
API layer logs same exception
Global handler logs same exception
```

can create noise.

A preferred model is:

* add useful context;
* propagate correctly;
* record the failure at the appropriate operational boundary.

---

## Logging Context

Logs should include context necessary to identify the operation.

Possible fields include:

```text
service
component
plugin_id
operation
environment
release_version
deployment_id
correlation_id
trace_id
```

Not every field is required for every event.

---

## Sensitive Logging

Logs must never become uncontrolled stores of FamilyOS domain data.

Prohibited or strongly restricted content includes:

* passwords;
* authentication tokens;
* private keys;
* secrets;
* health records;
* financial details;
* private communication content;
* document contents.

Operational metadata should be preferred.

---

## Log Redaction

When potentially sensitive values may enter logging paths, redaction must occur before export.

Example:

```text
Authorization: Bearer abc123
```

must never be stored directly.

It should become conceptually:

```text
Authorization: [REDACTED]
```

or be omitted entirely.

---

## Metrics

Metrics provide quantitative views of runtime behavior.

They support:

* monitoring;
* trend analysis;
* alerting;
* capacity planning;
* release verification;
* reliability analysis.

Metrics should represent stable operational concepts.

---

## Metric Types

FamilyOS may use common metric types such as:

```text
Counter
Gauge
Histogram
Distribution
```

The specific telemetry implementation may use equivalent concepts.

---

## Counters

Counters represent monotonically increasing event counts.

Examples include:

```text
requests_total
plugin_failures_total
release_rollbacks_total
dependency_timeouts_total
```

Counters are useful for calculating rates.

---

## Gauges

Gauges represent values that may increase or decrease.

Examples include:

```text
queue_depth
active_tasks
memory_usage
connected_plugins
```

Gauge semantics must be clearly defined.

---

## Histograms

Histograms represent distributions.

They are especially useful for:

* latency;
* payload size;
* processing duration;
* migration duration.

For example:

```text
request_duration_seconds
plugin_execution_duration_seconds
```

Histograms support percentile analysis.

---

## Metric Naming

Metric names should be:

* descriptive;
* stable;
* implementation-independent where practical;
* consistent across components.

Names should identify the measured concept.

Avoid names based on internal class names unless those names represent stable architectural concepts.

---

## Metric Units

Metric units must be explicit.

Examples include:

```text
seconds
bytes
requests
operations
items
```

A metric must not require operators to guess whether duration is measured in milliseconds or seconds.

---

## Metric Dimensions

Metrics may include dimensions or labels.

Useful dimensions include:

```text
service
component
plugin
operation
result
environment
release_version
```

Dimensions should support operational analysis.

---

## Cardinality

Metric dimensions must be carefully controlled.

High-cardinality values include:

* user IDs;
* document IDs;
* request IDs;
* correlation IDs;
* arbitrary error messages.

These values should generally not be used as metric labels.

---

## Cardinality Principle

The governing rule is:

> Metrics should describe groups of behavior, not uniquely identify individual operations.

Unique operation context belongs primarily in logs and traces.

---

## Metric Examples

Useful FamilyOS metrics may include:

```text
familyos_operations_total
familyos_operation_failures_total
familyos_operation_duration_seconds
familyos_plugin_execution_total
familyos_plugin_failure_total
familyos_dependency_request_total
familyos_dependency_latency_seconds
```

Exact naming conventions may evolve.

---

## Business Metrics

Operational observability and business analytics are separate concerns.

FamilyOS should not automatically expose domain-level activity as operational metrics.

For example, counts involving:

* financial transactions;
* health events;
* private communications;

may require additional governance.

Operational usefulness does not override privacy.

---

## Tracing

Tracing records execution paths across components.

Tracing is particularly useful when FamilyOS operations involve:

* multiple services;
* plugins;
* repositories;
* adapters;
* asynchronous jobs;
* external dependencies.

---

## Trace Structure

A trace contains one or more spans.

```text
Trace
 |
 +--> Root Span
       |
       +--> Plugin Span
       |
       +--> Repository Span
       |
       +--> External API Span
```

The trace reconstructs execution flow.

---

## Span Model

A span may contain:

```text
trace_id
span_id
parent_span_id
operation
start_time
duration
status
attributes
events
```

Spans should represent meaningful operational boundaries.

---

## Root Span

A root span represents the beginning of a traceable operation.

Examples include:

* CLI command;
* API request;
* scheduled task;
* plugin invocation;
* background job;
* release action.

The root span establishes correlation context.

---

## Child Spans

Child spans represent significant work performed during an operation.

Examples include:

* database query;
* plugin capability execution;
* external API request;
* file access;
* message delivery;
* dependency operation.

Tracing every function call should be avoided.

---

## Trace Context

Trace context must propagate across supported component boundaries.

Conceptually:

```text
Caller
  |
  v
trace_id = A
span_id = 1
  |
  v
Dependency
  |
  v
trace_id = A
span_id = 2
parent = 1
```

This preserves end-to-end execution relationships.

---

## Asynchronous Trace Propagation

Trace propagation should work across asynchronous execution where technically possible.

Examples include:

* task queues;
* event handlers;
* background workers;
* scheduled jobs.

The causal relationship should remain visible even when execution is not synchronous.

---

## Trace Attributes

Trace attributes may include:

```text
service
component
plugin_id
operation
environment
release_version
result
dependency
```

Sensitive domain content should not be used as trace attributes.

---

## Trace Events

Spans may contain important events.

Examples include:

```text
retry.started
cache.miss
dependency.timeout
fallback.activated
```

These events should add diagnostic value.

---

## Trace Status

Spans should expose outcome semantics.

A basic conceptual model is:

```text
SUCCESS
ERROR
```

Additional implementation-specific states may exist.

The meaning must remain consistent.

---

## Trace Sampling

Full tracing of every operation may not be practical.

Sampling may therefore be required.

Strategies may include:

```text
probabilistic sampling
rate-based sampling
error-biased sampling
latency-biased sampling
adaptive sampling
```

Sampling must be intentional.

---

## Error Sampling

Failures should generally receive stronger trace retention than successful routine operations.

For example:

```text
Normal Requests
      |
      v
Sampled

Failed Requests
      |
      v
Preferentially Retained
```

This improves diagnostic value.

---

## Sampling Transparency

Operators must understand when tracing is sampled.

Missing traces must not automatically imply that no operation occurred.

Sampling configuration should itself be observable and documented.

---

## Correlation Across Signals

Logs, metrics, and traces should support cross-signal analysis.

Example:

```text
Metric Alert
    |
    v
Error Rate Increased
    |
    v
Relevant Logs
    |
    v
Trace IDs
    |
    v
Detailed Execution Path
```

This is a core FamilyOS observability capability.

---

## Log and Trace Correlation

Logs generated inside traced operations should include:

```text
trace_id
```

and where useful:

```text
span_id
```

This allows operators to move from a log entry to a trace.

---

## Metric and Release Correlation

Metrics should support release comparison where practical.

For example:

```text
release_version = v4.8.0
```

may be used as a controlled dimension when the number of simultaneously active versions is bounded.

This supports release regression analysis.

---

## Metrics and Traces

Metrics can identify that a problem exists.

Traces can help identify where it occurs.

Example:

```text
Latency p95 increases
        |
        v
Trace Analysis
        |
        v
External dependency accounts for delay
```

The two capabilities should be used together.

---

## Common Operational Context

A shared observability context may include:

```text
environment
service
component
release_version
deployment_id
plugin_id
operation
correlation_id
trace_id
```

Each telemetry signal should use relevant fields consistently.

---

## Correlation ID

A correlation ID may represent a logical operation across systems.

It is distinct from trace identifiers when the operation extends beyond a single trace or tracing is unavailable.

The semantics must be documented.

---

## Request ID

Request IDs identify individual requests where applicable.

Request IDs may be useful in logs.

They should generally not become metric dimensions.

---

## Operation ID

Long-running operations may use an operation identifier.

Examples include:

* migration execution;
* backup operation;
* release deployment;
* bulk document processing.

Operation IDs support long-running workflow correlation.

---

## Plugin Logging

Plugins must use FamilyOS logging conventions.

Plugin logs should identify:

```text
plugin_id
plugin_version
capability
operation
result
```

when relevant.

Plugins should not create independent incompatible log formats.

---

## Plugin Metrics

Plugins may emit metrics through approved observability interfaces.

Plugin metrics must follow:

* naming conventions;
* cardinality limits;
* privacy rules;
* common dimensions.

The platform should be able to distinguish plugin telemetry from core telemetry.

---

## Plugin Tracing

Plugin execution should participate in existing traces where appropriate.

Conceptually:

```text
FamilyOS Operation
       |
       v
Core Span
       |
       v
Plugin Span
       |
       v
Dependency Span
```

Plugins should not create unrelated trace roots when a parent context already exists.

---

## Dependency Telemetry

External dependencies should produce consistent telemetry.

Useful metrics include:

```text
dependency_requests_total
dependency_failures_total
dependency_duration_seconds
```

Logs should identify meaningful dependency failures.

Traces should represent external calls as spans where appropriate.

---

## Database Telemetry

Database observability may include:

* query duration;
* connection failures;
* transaction failures;
* pool usage;
* migration operations.

Sensitive query values should not be logged.

Raw SQL containing private data must be handled carefully.

---

## CLI Logging

CLI operations may emit structured logs.

Useful context may include:

```text
command
result
duration
plugin_id
release_version
```

User-entered command arguments must be evaluated for sensitive content before logging.

---

## Background Task Telemetry

Background tasks should expose:

* start;
* completion;
* failure;
* duration;
* retry behavior.

A background task may use:

```text
task_type
operation_id
correlation_id
```

for traceability.

---

## Scheduled Job Metrics

Scheduled operations may expose metrics such as:

```text
job_runs_total
job_failures_total
job_duration_seconds
```

These metrics help detect silent background failures.

---

## Release Telemetry

Release operations should produce coordinated signals.

Examples include:

```text
release.deployment.started
release.deployment.completed
release.verification.failed
release.rollback.started
release.rollback.completed
```

Relevant metrics may include:

```text
release_deployments_total
release_failures_total
release_rollbacks_total
```

Traces may represent complex automated release workflows.

---

## Security Telemetry

Security-relevant logs and metrics must use stricter controls.

Examples include:

* authentication failures;
* authorization denials;
* integrity failures;
* suspicious access patterns.

Sensitive security telemetry may require restricted access and retention.

---

## Privacy Boundaries

Observability must not expose FamilyOS private domain content merely to simplify debugging.

A useful principle is:

```text
Operational Metadata
        |
        v
Allowed by Default

Domain Payload
        |
        v
Restricted by Default
```

Exceptions require explicit governance.

---

## Data Minimization

Each telemetry field should have an operational purpose.

If a value is not required for:

* monitoring;
* diagnosis;
* security;
* reliability;
* release verification;

it should not automatically be collected.

---

## Retention

Logs, metrics, and traces may require different retention strategies.

For example:

```text
Metrics
  |
  v
Long-term trend retention

Logs
  |
  v
Medium-term diagnostic retention

Traces
  |
  v
Selective detailed retention
```

The actual periods are governed separately.

---

## Retention and Sensitivity

More sensitive telemetry may require shorter retention or stronger access controls.

Retention decisions must consider:

* operational need;
* privacy;
* security;
* compliance;
* cost.

---

## Telemetry Volume

The framework must control signal volume.

Potential controls include:

* log level filtering;
* metric aggregation;
* trace sampling;
* event deduplication;
* retention limits.

Excess telemetry can reduce observability quality by creating noise.

---

## Logging Noise

Repeated routine events should not overwhelm meaningful signals.

For example, logging every successful low-level internal function call at INFO is discouraged.

Logging strategy should prioritize operationally significant boundaries.

---

## Metric Noise

Metrics that are never used or interpreted should be reconsidered.

Every metric should have a clear reason to exist.

Possible purposes include:

* dashboard;
* alert;
* capacity analysis;
* release verification;
* reliability analysis.

---

## Trace Noise

Tracing extremely small internal operations may create excessive complexity.

Span creation should focus on meaningful boundaries.

Examples include:

* external calls;
* database operations;
* plugin execution;
* significant application operations.

---

## Performance

Telemetry must have bounded runtime overhead.

Instrumentation should minimize:

* synchronous network calls;
* excessive serialization;
* blocking exports;
* high memory usage;
* uncontrolled buffering.

Critical business execution should not depend on successful telemetry export in normal conditions.

---

## Telemetry Failure

Telemetry systems may fail.

Applications should generally continue operating when non-critical telemetry export fails.

Conceptually:

```text
Business Operation
      |
      +--> Success
      |
      +--> Telemetry Export
              |
              X Failure
```

The telemetry failure should itself become observable where possible.

---

## Buffering

Collectors or exporters may temporarily buffer telemetry.

Buffering must remain bounded.

Unbounded telemetry buffering can become an availability risk.

---

## Dropped Telemetry

When telemetry is dropped because of overload or backend failure, the platform should expose that condition where possible.

Examples include:

```text
telemetry_dropped_total
export_failures_total
```

Missing evidence should be explainable.

---

## Time Synchronization

Telemetry correlation depends on accurate timestamps.

FamilyOS runtime environments should maintain sufficiently synchronized clocks.

All telemetry timestamps should use a consistent representation.

UTC should be preferred for stored operational timestamps.

---

## Timestamp Precision

Timestamp precision should match operational need.

Excessive precision adds little value when underlying systems cannot preserve or correlate it reliably.

Consistency is more important than unnecessary precision.

---

## OpenTelemetry Alignment

Where practical, FamilyOS should remain compatible with open telemetry conventions and industry-standard semantic models.

However, FamilyOS architecture must not depend on one specific implementation library.

The framework should preserve:

* vendor independence;
* replaceable adapters;
* stable internal observability semantics.

---

## Observability Interfaces

FamilyOS may expose abstractions conceptually similar to:

```text
Logger
MetricRecorder
Tracer
```

Application components should depend on these abstractions rather than on vendor-specific backends when architectural decoupling is required.

---

## Dependency Inversion

The preferred dependency direction is:

```text
Application / Platform Code
          |
          v
Observability Abstraction
          ^
          |
Infrastructure Adapter
          |
          v
Telemetry Backend
```

This preserves FamilyOS architectural independence.

---

## Testing Logging

Logging behavior should be testable where operationally significant.

Tests may verify:

* expected event name;
* expected severity;
* required context;
* redaction.

Tests should not unnecessarily lock implementation to exact human-readable message wording.

---

## Testing Metrics

Metric tests may verify:

* metric emitted;
* correct increment;
* expected dimensions;
* duration recorded;
* no forbidden high-cardinality dimensions.

Metrics are part of the runtime contract where used by operational controls.

---

## Testing Tracing

Tracing tests may verify:

* root span creation;
* child span relationships;
* context propagation;
* error status;
* required attributes.

Tracing must remain testable without requiring external telemetry infrastructure.

---

## Validation

Logging, metrics, and tracing should be validated through representative operational scenarios.

Example:

```text
Plugin Operation
      |
      +--> Counter incremented
      |
      +--> Structured completion log
      |
      +--> Trace span created
```

Failure scenario:

```text
External Dependency Timeout
      |
      +--> failure metric
      |
      +--> ERROR log
      |
      +--> span marked failed
```

Correlation must remain possible.

---

## Observability Quality

Good telemetry should answer operational questions efficiently.

Examples include:

* What failed?
* Where did it fail?
* How often is it failing?
* How long does it take?
* Which release is affected?
* Which dependency is involved?
* Which plugin is affected?

Telemetry that cannot support meaningful questions should be reconsidered.

---

## Governance

Logging, metrics, and tracing conventions are governed by the FamilyOS Observability Framework.

Governance must maintain:

* naming standards;
* severity semantics;
* cardinality rules;
* required runtime context;
* privacy constraints;
* security requirements;
* interoperability.

Individual components may add domain-specific telemetry where justified.

---

## Evolution

Telemetry models will evolve as FamilyOS grows.

Changes should preserve compatibility where practical.

Material changes may include:

* renamed metrics;
* changed event semantics;
* new required context;
* altered sampling behavior.

Such changes must be governed because operational tooling may depend on them.

---

## Anti-Patterns

The following practices are prohibited or strongly discouraged.

### Print-Based Production Logging

Using arbitrary `print` output as the primary production logging model.

### Logging Secrets

Recording passwords, tokens, private keys, or credentials.

### Logging Domain Payloads by Default

Persisting private FamilyOS business data for convenience.

### Unique IDs as Metric Labels

Using correlation IDs, user IDs, or document IDs as high-cardinality metric dimensions.

### Metric Without Unit

Creating measurements whose unit cannot be determined.

### Duplicate Exception Logging

Recording the same failure at every layer without additional diagnostic value.

### Trace Every Function

Creating spans for trivial internal function calls.

### Vendor-Specific Application Coupling

Embedding telemetry vendor APIs directly throughout business logic.

### Missing Release Context

Running production telemetry without being able to identify the active release.

### Silent Telemetry Loss

Dropping observability data without any indication that collection is degraded.

---

## Required Outcomes

Implementation of this framework section must ensure that:

* FamilyOS uses structured logging;
* log severity is consistent;
* sensitive data is protected;
* metrics have stable names and units;
* metric cardinality remains controlled;
* traces represent meaningful execution boundaries;
* trace context can propagate across relevant components;
* logs and traces can be correlated;
* runtime telemetry can be correlated with release identity;
* plugins use common telemetry conventions;
* telemetry failure remains bounded;
* signal volume is controlled;
* observability remains vendor-independent;
* telemetry behavior can be validated.

---

## Final Logging, Metrics, and Tracing Principle

Logging, metrics, and tracing provide different perspectives on the same runtime system.

They are most valuable when they share context and work together.

The final principle is:

> FamilyOS must use structured logs to explain events, metrics to measure behavior, and traces to reconstruct execution, while correlating all three through consistent operational context and protecting the privacy and security of family data.

`04-Logging-Metrics-and-Tracing.md` therefore establishes the core telemetry model for the FamilyOS Observability Framework.
