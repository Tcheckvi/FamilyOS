### Observability Data and Correlation

### Overview

This document defines how FamilyOS structures, identifies, correlates, propagates, stores, and manages observability data.

Observability signals become significantly more valuable when they can be connected to the same logical execution context.

FamilyOS therefore treats correlation as a first-class architectural capability.

The objective is to allow runtime evidence from logs, metrics, traces, health checks, diagnostics, and alerts to contribute to a coherent operational view without exposing unnecessary family or personal information.

---

## Objectives

The observability data and correlation model must:

* establish common contextual metadata;
* provide stable correlation mechanisms;
* support execution reconstruction;
* work across platform and plugin boundaries;
* support synchronous and asynchronous execution;
* protect sensitive information;
* remain independent of telemetry vendors;
* support testing;
* define observability data lifecycle expectations;
* enable future operational automation.

---

## Observability Data

Observability data is information generated to describe the operational behavior of FamilyOS.

It may include:

```text id="1yrrnw"
log records
metric measurements
trace spans
health results
diagnostic records
alerts
runtime events
```

These signals have different structures but SHOULD share common contextual concepts where applicable.

---

## Common Context

FamilyOS SHOULD define a common observability context.

Conceptually:

```text id="m14chh"
ObservabilityContext
    │
    ├── correlation_id
    ├── trace_id
    ├── operation_id
    ├── component
    ├── plugin
    └── workflow_id
```

Not every field must exist for every operation.

The context should contain only identifiers relevant to the current execution.

---

## Correlation Identifier

A `correlation_id` connects runtime evidence belonging to the same broader logical activity.

Example:

```text id="q57u22"
correlation_id = "c-01J..."
```

The identifier SHOULD be:

* unique enough for its intended scope;
* opaque;
* immutable during the correlated activity;
* safe to expose in operational telemetry.

A correlation identifier MUST NOT encode private family information.

---

## Trace Identifier

A `trace_id` identifies a traced execution path.

Conceptually:

```text id="ntf8ec"
correlation_id
      │
      ├── trace_id A
      ├── trace_id B
      └── trace_id C
```

A single correlation context may therefore include multiple traces when work is split across asynchronous or independent execution paths.

---

## Operation Identifier

An `operation_id` MAY identify a specific logical operation.

For example:

```text id="x3w99e"
operation_id = "op-01J..."
```

This can be useful for operations that require identity independent of tracing.

An operation identifier SHOULD NOT automatically become a metric dimension because its cardinality may be unbounded.

---

## Workflow Identifier

Long-running FamilyOS workflows may use:

```text id="hvc7hh"
workflow_id
```

to correlate multiple operations belonging to the same workflow.

Conceptually:

```text id="gz7nx9"
Workflow
   │
   ├── Operation A
   │      └── Trace A
   │
   ├── Operation B
   │      └── Trace B
   │
   └── Operation C
          └── Trace C
```

The workflow identifier provides continuity beyond individual execution traces.

---

## Component Identity

Signals SHOULD identify their source when this information provides operational value.

Examples include:

```text id="yduqfs"
component = "plugin_registry"

component = "workflow_engine"

component = "document_repository"
```

Component names SHOULD use stable engineering identifiers rather than runtime-specific object representations.

---

## Plugin Identity

Plugin-generated signals SHOULD identify the responsible plugin where applicable.

Conceptually:

```text id="mgsm0c"
plugin_id = "communication"
```

Plugin identity must use the canonical FamilyOS plugin identifier.

Plugins MUST NOT invent incompatible correlation mechanisms when platform context is available.

---

## Capability Identity

Capability execution MAY include a stable capability identifier.

For example:

```text id="xg57mk"
capability = "communication.send"
```

This enables operational analysis without exposing the content processed by the capability.

---

## Correlation Context Creation

A correlation context SHOULD be created at the earliest meaningful execution boundary when one does not already exist.

For example:

```text id="v2rx13"
CLI Command
    │
    ▼
Create Correlation Context
    │
    ▼
Application Service
    │
    ▼
Capability
    │
    ▼
Plugin
```

Existing valid context SHOULD normally be propagated rather than replaced.

---

## Context Propagation

Correlation context SHOULD follow the logical execution path.

```text id="f3d09m"
Entry Point
   │
   │ correlation_id = C1
   ▼
Application
   │
   │ correlation_id = C1
   ▼
Capability
   │
   │ correlation_id = C1
   ▼
Repository
```

Components should not require callers to manually reconstruct correlation metadata at every layer.

---

## Context Boundaries

Context propagation must be explicit at architectural boundaries.

Examples include:

* application calls;
* capability invocation;
* plugin execution;
* workflow transitions;
* repository calls;
* external integrations;
* task creation;
* asynchronous processing.

Internal implementation details do not necessarily require independent correlation boundaries.

---

## Asynchronous Context

Asynchronous work requires context to survive beyond the original call stack.

Conceptually:

```text id="ph9bgl"
Operation
   │
   │ correlation_id = C1
   ▼
Task Created
   │
   │ context stored safely
   ▼
Queue
   │
   ▼
Worker
   │
   │ correlation_id = C1
   ▼
Task Execution
```

Only required correlation metadata SHOULD be propagated.

Sensitive execution state must not be copied merely for observability convenience.

---

## External Integration Context

FamilyOS may interact with external systems.

Correlation metadata MAY cross an integration boundary when:

* the external protocol supports it;
* doing so provides diagnostic value;
* security and privacy permit it.

Internal identifiers MUST NOT be exposed externally without justification.

FamilyOS may map internal and external correlation identifiers when isolation is required.

---

## Correlation and Logs

Structured logs SHOULD include applicable correlation context.

Example:

```text id="0x3fhg"
event_name     = "familyos.capability.failed"
capability     = "communication.send"
correlation_id = "c-01J..."
trace_id       = "t-01J..."
outcome        = "failure"
```

This allows related log events to be queried as a logical group.

---

## Correlation and Traces

Tracing inherently uses execution identifiers.

FamilyOS tracing SHOULD integrate with the common observability context rather than maintain an unrelated identity model.

```text id="oyxsn1"
Observability Context
        │
        └── trace_id
                │
                ▼
              Trace
                │
                ├── Span A
                ├── Span B
                └── Span C
```

---

## Correlation and Metrics

Metrics require special treatment.

High-cardinality correlation identifiers SHOULD NOT normally be used as metric labels.

Avoid:

```text id="4fcd08"
operation_duration{
    correlation_id="c-01J..."
}
```

Prefer bounded dimensions:

```text id="85hxws"
operation_duration{
    capability="communication.send",
    outcome="success"
}
```

Detailed correlation remains available through logs and traces.

---

## Correlation and Health

Health results MAY include component or dependency identifiers.

Health data SHOULD generally describe current operational state rather than individual user operations.

Correlation identifiers are therefore only appropriate when a health result relates directly to a specific diagnostic execution.

---

## Correlation and Diagnostics

Diagnostic records SHOULD include correlation context when they are generated as part of an investigation or failed operation.

This allows:

```text id="s7ksg4"
Failure
   ↓
Trace
   ↓
Logs
   ↓
Diagnostics
```

to remain connected.

---

## Correlation and Alerts

Alerts SHOULD identify the component and condition responsible for the alert.

Where relevant, an alert MAY reference supporting traces or correlation contexts.

An alert SHOULD NOT depend on a single transient correlation identifier for its identity because an operational condition may span many executions.

---

## Event Time

Observability records SHOULD contain reliable event timestamps where applicable.

FamilyOS should distinguish conceptually between:

```text id="05rxrv"
event_time
collection_time
processing_time
```

The initial implementation may only require event time.

The distinction becomes important if telemetry pipelines become distributed.

---

## Time Representation

Internal observability timestamps SHOULD use a consistent unambiguous representation.

UTC SHOULD be preferred for persisted or exchanged operational timestamps.

Presentation systems may convert timestamps into local time for human consumption.

---

## Duration

Durations SHOULD be represented independently from wall-clock timestamps.

For example:

```text id="jy7n9r"
duration_ms = 42
```

Implementations SHOULD use monotonic clocks for runtime duration measurement where appropriate.

Clock adjustments must not create invalid execution durations.

---

## Data Classification

Observability data SHOULD be classified according to its sensitivity.

A simple conceptual model is:

```text id="ymzq8h"
Operational
     ↓
Internal
     ↓
Sensitive
     ↓
Restricted
```

Most telemetry SHOULD remain within operational or internal classifications.

Sensitive and restricted data SHOULD normally be excluded from telemetry entirely.

---

## Data Minimization

FamilyOS applies data minimization to observability.

A signal should contain only information necessary for its operational purpose.

For example:

```text id="nn86y9"
GOOD

event_name = "familyos.document.created"
document_type = "family_record"
outcome = "success"
```

rather than:

```text id="35qyns"
BAD

document_content = "<private family information>"
```

---

## Identifiers and Privacy

Identifiers can themselves become sensitive.

FamilyOS SHOULD avoid exposing direct personal identifiers in telemetry.

Where identity is operationally necessary, implementations SHOULD prefer:

* opaque identifiers;
* pseudonymous identifiers;
* scoped identifiers;
* aggregated information.

The exact mechanism depends on the security and privacy architecture.

---

## Schema Evolution

Observability data schemas will evolve.

Changes SHOULD favor additive evolution.

For example:

```text id="asuy3w"
v1
event_name
component
outcome

v1 compatible extension
event_name
component
outcome
duration_ms
```

Removing or redefining established fields may require explicit versioning.

---

## Event Versioning

Important structured event contracts MAY include a schema version.

Conceptually:

```text id="8o75de"
event_name = "familyos.capability.completed"
schema_version = 1
```

Versioning SHOULD only be introduced where it provides actual compatibility value.

Not every internal debug signal requires formal versioning.

---

## Data Lifecycle

Persisted observability data has a lifecycle.

```text id="wt7dc8"
Generate
   ↓
Collect
   ↓
Process
   ↓
Store
   ↓
Analyze
   ↓
Retain
   ↓
Delete
```

Each stage must preserve security and privacy requirements.

---

## Collection

Collection mechanisms SHOULD accept standardized FamilyOS signals.

Components should emit through platform abstractions rather than depend directly on storage or external telemetry systems.

```text id="mhajh4"
Component
   │
   ▼
FamilyOS Observability Contract
   │
   ▼
Collector
```

---

## Processing

Observability processing MAY perform operations such as:

* validation;
* enrichment;
* filtering;
* redaction;
* aggregation;
* sampling;
* routing.

Processing MUST NOT silently change the semantic meaning of a signal.

---

## Storage

The framework does not mandate persistent telemetry storage.

When storage is introduced, it must define:

* access control;
* retention;
* security;
* integrity;
* deletion;
* capacity limits.

Local development environments may use transient or in-memory storage.

---

## Retention

Observability data SHOULD have explicit retention policies when persisted.

Retention duration should reflect:

* diagnostic requirements;
* operational requirements;
* security considerations;
* privacy obligations;
* storage cost.

Indefinite retention SHOULD NOT be the default.

---

## Deletion

Expired observability data SHOULD be deleted according to applicable retention policy.

Deletion mechanisms must include derived or replicated telemetry where required by the storage architecture.

---

## Integrity

Operational evidence should remain trustworthy.

Where observability data is used for security, compliance, release validation, or incident investigation, appropriate integrity controls SHOULD prevent unnoticed modification.

The strength of those controls should be proportional to the evidence requirement.

---

## Availability

Loss of observability data should not normally cause failure of unrelated FamilyOS business operations.

However, telemetry availability may be important for:

* incident investigation;
* security monitoring;
* release verification;
* compliance evidence.

Required availability levels should therefore be defined according to the consumer.

---

## Correlation Failure

If correlation context cannot be propagated, the operation SHOULD normally continue when safe.

The observability layer may record that correlation was lost.

It MUST NOT fabricate a relationship between unrelated operations.

---

## Context Validation

Incoming correlation context SHOULD be validated.

Invalid, malformed, excessively large, or unsafe values SHOULD NOT be trusted blindly.

External correlation identifiers should be treated as untrusted input.

---

## Testability

FamilyOS SHOULD provide deterministic mechanisms for testing correlation.

Tests may verify:

```text id="4i0vcz"
context created
context propagated
context preserved
child trace linked
plugin receives context
async task receives context
sensitive data excluded
metrics avoid high-cardinality identifiers
```

Correlation behavior should not require external telemetry infrastructure to test.

---

## Minimal Correlation Model

The initial implementation SHOULD remain small.

A suitable first model is:

```text id="i3h5dg"
ObservabilityContext
        │
        ├── correlation_id
        ├── trace_id
        └── operation_id
```

Additional identifiers should be introduced only when concrete requirements justify them.

---

## Minimal Data Pipeline

The initial observability data flow may remain entirely local.

```text id="wz95ms"
FamilyOS Component
        ↓
Observability Contract
        ↓
In-Memory / Local Collector
        ↓
Validation / Test Inspection
```

Persistent external telemetry infrastructure is not required to complete the first observability implementation.

---

## Future Evolution

The architecture can later evolve toward:

```text id="8edcpe"
FamilyOS Components
        ↓
Observability API
        ↓
Collector
        ↓
Processing
        ↓
Export
        ↓
Telemetry Platform
        ↓
Analysis
        ↓
Automation
```

This evolution must preserve the FamilyOS contracts defined at the application boundary.

---

## Operational Query Model

A mature implementation should eventually make it possible to start with one operational identifier and reconstruct related evidence.

For example:

```text id="yzx1jr"
correlation_id
      │
      ├── Logs
      ├── Traces
      ├── Failures
      ├── Diagnostics
      └── Related Operations
```

This is the primary value of correlation.

It turns isolated telemetry into connected runtime evidence.

---

## Success Criteria

This part of the Observability Framework is successful when FamilyOS can:

* establish a common runtime context;
* create opaque correlation identifiers;
* propagate context across architectural boundaries;
* support asynchronous correlation;
* connect logs and traces;
* avoid high-cardinality metric correlation;
* protect private identifiers;
* manage structured observability data;
* evolve schemas safely;
* define telemetry lifecycle expectations;
* test correlation deterministically;
* remain independent of external observability vendors.

---

## Conclusion

Observability signals have limited value when they exist as isolated records.

Correlation transforms those signals into an understandable execution history.

The FamilyOS model is therefore:

```text id="0iclhq"
Runtime Signals
      +
Shared Context
      +
Stable Identity
      +
Safe Propagation
      =
Correlated Runtime Evidence
```

The governing principle is:

> FamilyOS observability data must make runtime behavior connectable without making private family information observable.

This balance between operational understanding and data protection is fundamental to the FamilyOS observability architecture.
