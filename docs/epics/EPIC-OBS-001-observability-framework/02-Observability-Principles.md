# Observability Principles

## EPIC-OBS-001

### Observability Principles

### Overview

This document defines the engineering principles governing observability across the FamilyOS ecosystem.

These principles establish how runtime signals are designed, generated, correlated, protected, consumed, and evolved.

They apply to the FamilyOS core platform, official plugins, capabilities, workflows, integrations, and future operational components.

The objective is not to maximize telemetry.

The objective is to produce useful, structured, secure, and proportional runtime evidence.

---

## Principle 1 — Observable by Design

Observability SHOULD be considered during component design rather than added only after failures occur.

Important architectural boundaries SHOULD expose sufficient runtime evidence to understand their behavior.

Typical observable boundaries include:

* application entry points;
* capability execution;
* plugin lifecycle operations;
* workflow transitions;
* repository operations;
* external integrations;
* asynchronous processing;
* significant failures.

A component requiring operational understanding should not depend entirely on ad hoc debugging.

---

## Principle 2 — Structured by Default

Operational signals SHOULD use structured representations whenever practical.

Important context should be represented through explicit fields rather than embedded exclusively in free-form messages.

Examples include:

```text
timestamp
severity
event_name
component
operation
correlation_id
duration
outcome
failure_category
```

Human-readable messages may complement structured information but SHOULD NOT replace essential machine-readable context.

---

## Principle 3 — Correlatable by Design

Signals belonging to the same logical operation SHOULD be correlatable.

Correlation context should propagate across relevant architectural boundaries.

Examples may include:

```text
trace_id
correlation_id
operation_id
workflow_id
plugin_id
component_id
```

Correlation identifiers MUST NOT expose sensitive information.

---

## Principle 4 — Meaningful Signals Over Maximum Signals

More telemetry does not automatically produce better observability.

FamilyOS SHOULD emit signals that provide operational value.

Signals should help answer questions such as:

* what happened;
* where it happened;
* when it happened;
* how long it took;
* whether it succeeded;
* what dependency was involved;
* how related operations can be identified.

Telemetry without clear diagnostic, operational, security, or quality value SHOULD be avoided.

---

## Principle 5 — Privacy by Design

FamilyOS observability MUST protect family information.

The preferred rule is:

> Observe the operation, not the private content.

Observability signals SHOULD describe system behavior without reproducing the data being processed.

Sensitive data MUST be minimized, excluded, masked, or otherwise protected.

---

## Principle 6 — Secrets Never Become Telemetry

Secrets MUST NOT intentionally appear in observability signals.

This includes:

* passwords;
* authentication tokens;
* API keys;
* private cryptographic material;
* session secrets;
* access credentials;
* equivalent protected values.

Instrumentation SHOULD be designed so that sensitive values are excluded before signals are emitted.

---

## Principle 7 — Failures Must Leave Evidence

Significant failures SHOULD produce sufficient runtime evidence for investigation.

Where appropriate, failure evidence should identify:

```text
failure category
affected operation
responsible component
timestamp
correlation context
dependency context
retry state
```

This does not require exposing internal or sensitive data.

The purpose is to make failures diagnosable.

---

## Principle 8 — Observability Must Not Change Functional Behavior

Instrumentation SHOULD remain operationally separate from business behavior.

Failure to emit non-critical telemetry SHOULD NOT normally cause a successful business operation to fail.

For example:

```text
Business Operation
       │
       ├── Functional Result
       │
       └── Observability Signal
```

The observability path should not unnecessarily become a functional dependency.

Exceptions must be explicitly justified, particularly for mandatory security or audit requirements.

---

## Principle 9 — Proportional Instrumentation

Instrumentation SHOULD be proportional to:

* operational importance;
* diagnostic value;
* failure impact;
* execution frequency;
* performance cost;
* security requirements.

High-frequency low-value operations should not produce excessive telemetry.

Critical operations may justify richer evidence.

---

## Principle 10 — Stable Semantics

Observability contracts SHOULD use stable meanings.

A field or event must not silently change semantic meaning between components or versions.

For example, if:

```text
outcome = success
```

is defined, its meaning should remain consistent across compatible implementations.

Changes to important observability semantics SHOULD be governed like other engineering contracts.

---

## Principle 11 — Consistent Time

Runtime signals SHOULD use consistent timestamp conventions.

Timestamps should support:

* ordering;
* correlation;
* duration analysis;
* incident reconstruction.

Internal representations SHOULD avoid ambiguous local-time assumptions.

Presentation layers may convert timestamps for human consumption.

---

## Principle 12 — Explicit Severity

Logs and events requiring severity classification SHOULD use a defined severity model.

A typical conceptual progression is:

```text
DEBUG
INFO
WARNING
ERROR
CRITICAL
```

The exact implementation may evolve, but severity meanings must remain consistent.

Severity SHOULD represent operational significance rather than developer preference.

---

## Principle 13 — Metrics Must Have Meaning

Metrics SHOULD represent clearly defined measurements.

Every important metric should have an understandable purpose.

Examples include:

```text
operation_count
operation_duration
failure_count
retry_count
queue_depth
dependency_latency
```

Metrics SHOULD avoid uncontrolled dimensions that create excessive cardinality or operational cost.

---

## Principle 14 — Traces Represent Execution

Tracing SHOULD represent meaningful execution paths.

Trace spans should correspond to operations that help explain system behavior.

Tracing every internal function call is neither required nor desirable.

Useful trace boundaries may include:

```text
request
workflow
capability
plugin operation
repository operation
external dependency call
```

---

## Principle 15 — Health Is Not Logging

Health signals represent current operational condition.

They should not be inferred exclusively from log messages.

FamilyOS SHOULD use explicit health semantics such as:

```text
healthy
degraded
unhealthy
unknown
```

Health evaluation should remain predictable enough for automated consumption.

---

## Principle 16 — Diagnostics Are Controlled

Diagnostic information can expose deeper internal state than normal observability signals.

Diagnostics therefore require stronger control.

Diagnostic capabilities SHOULD:

* expose only necessary information;
* avoid sensitive content;
* support controlled access;
* remain distinguishable from normal telemetry.

Debugging convenience must not override privacy or security.

---

## Principle 17 — Vendor Neutrality

Core FamilyOS observability contracts MUST remain independent of specific monitoring vendors.

The architecture should conceptually follow:

```text
FamilyOS
   │
   ▼
Observability Contracts
   │
   ▼
Observability Adapter
   │
   ├── Local
   ├── Test
   └── External Platform
```

External observability technologies should remain replaceable.

---

## Principle 18 — Local Development Must Remain Supported

Observability must provide value without requiring production infrastructure.

Developers SHOULD be able to inspect relevant runtime evidence during:

* local execution;
* unit testing;
* integration testing;
* plugin development;
* debugging.

A remote monitoring platform must not be required to understand basic FamilyOS execution.

---

## Principle 19 — Observability Must Be Testable

Important instrumentation behavior SHOULD be verifiable through automated tests.

Tests may verify:

* signal emission;
* required fields;
* correlation propagation;
* severity;
* failure classification;
* privacy filtering;
* health-state behavior.

Observability tests SHOULD focus on contracts rather than fragile textual formatting.

---

## Principle 20 — Plugins Participate in Platform Observability

Plugins SHOULD integrate with the FamilyOS observability model rather than create incompatible parallel systems.

Plugin signals should follow common conventions for:

* correlation;
* severity;
* metadata;
* failures;
* health;
* privacy.

Plugin compliance rules may enforce required observability behavior.

---

## Principle 21 — Observability Data Has a Lifecycle

Telemetry is data and therefore requires lifecycle management.

Where signals are persisted, their lifecycle may include:

```text
Generation
    ↓
Collection
    ↓
Processing
    ↓
Storage
    ↓
Analysis
    ↓
Retention
    ↓
Deletion
```

Retention must be intentional.

Observability data SHOULD NOT be preserved indefinitely without a justified requirement.

---

## Principle 22 — Operational Evidence Must Be Trustworthy

Runtime evidence should accurately represent what occurred.

Instrumentation SHOULD avoid:

* misleading success signals;
* incomplete failure states;
* inconsistent timestamps;
* fabricated measurements;
* ambiguous identifiers.

Observability loses its value when operators cannot trust the evidence it provides.

---

## Principle 23 — Graceful Degradation

Observability mechanisms SHOULD degrade gracefully when non-critical telemetry infrastructure is unavailable.

Conceptually:

```text
Application
    │
    ├── Core Operation ─────► Continue when safe
    │
    └── Telemetry ──────────► Degrade gracefully
```

Telemetry failures may themselves generate local diagnostic evidence when practical.

---

## Principle 24 — Automation Consumes Contracts

Future automation SHOULD consume structured observability contracts rather than parse arbitrary human-readable log messages.

This applies to capabilities such as:

* automated health checks;
* anomaly detection;
* release verification;
* quality gates;
* incident correlation;
* automated diagnostics.

Machine consumption requires predictable semantics.

---

## Principle 25 — Evolution Must Preserve Compatibility

Observability schemas and contracts will evolve.

Evolution SHOULD preserve compatibility wherever practical.

Changes should distinguish between:

* additive changes;
* compatible semantic changes;
* deprecated fields;
* breaking changes.

Breaking observability contract changes SHOULD be explicit and versioned where required.

---

## Principle 26 — Observability Must Remain Simple

The first implementation of FamilyOS observability SHOULD remain intentionally lightweight.

Complexity should be introduced only when actual operational requirements justify it.

The preferred progression is:

```text
Contracts
   ↓
Basic Instrumentation
   ↓
Correlation
   ↓
Collection
   ↓
Analysis
   ↓
Automation
```

FamilyOS should not adopt large observability infrastructure simply because such infrastructure exists.

---

## Decision Hierarchy

When observability requirements conflict, FamilyOS SHOULD prioritize:

```text
Security & Privacy
        ↓
Functional Correctness
        ↓
Evidence Trustworthiness
        ↓
Diagnostic Value
        ↓
Reliability
        ↓
Performance
        ↓
Convenience
```

No observability requirement justifies violating security or privacy boundaries.

---

## Practical Design Test

Before adding an observability signal, engineers should be able to answer:

1. What question does this signal help answer?
2. Who or what consumes it?
3. Can it be correlated?
4. Does it expose sensitive information?
5. What does it cost to generate?
6. Does it have stable semantics?
7. Can its behavior be tested?

If these questions cannot be answered, the signal may not belong in the system.

---

## Principle Summary

The FamilyOS Observability Framework can be summarized as:

```text
Observable
Structured
Correlatable
Meaningful
Secure
Private
Proportional
Reliable
Testable
Vendor-Neutral
Automatable
Simple
```

Together, these principles establish the constraints under which the FamilyOS observability architecture will be designed and implemented.

---

## Conclusion

FamilyOS observability exists to create trustworthy runtime understanding.

It must not become uncontrolled logging, unnecessary infrastructure, or indiscriminate data collection.

The governing principle is:

> Generate the minimum trustworthy runtime evidence required to understand, diagnose, protect, and operate FamilyOS.

These principles form the foundation for the observability architecture defined by EPIC-OBS-001.
