## Overview

EPIC-OBS-001 establishes the authoritative **FamilyOS Observability Framework**.

The framework defines the principles, architecture, telemetry model, logging, metrics, tracing, health, diagnostics, alerting, correlation, governance, security, privacy, implementation, automation, validation, and release-observability requirements used throughout FamilyOS.

Observability is treated as a permanent engineering capability spanning:

```text
Architecture
    ↓
Implementation
    ↓
Testing
    ↓
Build
    ↓
Release
    ↓
Runtime Operation
    ↓
Observation
    ↓
Diagnosis
    ↓
Improvement
```

The framework is designed to make FamilyOS behavior:

* visible;
* diagnosable;
* measurable;
* correlatable;
* explainable;
* privacy-aware;
* security-aware;
* testable;
* automatable;
* vendor-neutral;
* operationally useful.

---

## Historical Framework Model

EPIC-OBS-001 was originally authored using the historical compact FamilyOS framework documentation model.

The historical publication contained exactly:

```text
10 numbered documents
0 control documents
10 total files
```

The canonical numbered sequence was:

```text
00 → 09
```

This historical structure is intentional and SHALL remain preserved as part of the original publication record.

The absence of modern control documents in the historical release SHALL NOT be interpreted as corruption or incomplete publication.

---

## Historical Publication

Version `4.9.0` was historically published under:

```text
v4.9.0-observability-framework
```

Historical publication commit:

```text
5cb395e5beb973a4b6595eae0f3cb75142261dd7
```

Historical publication state:

```text
Published
```

The historical release tag is immutable.

Post-release normalization SHALL NOT:

* move the historical tag;
* recreate the tag on another commit;
* overwrite the tag;
* rewrite the historical release commit;
* represent a later normalization commit as the original publication.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of EPIC-OBS-001 is to establish the canonical FamilyOS observability foundation.

The framework provides a common model for:

* logs;
* metrics;
* traces;
* events;
* health;
* readiness;
* diagnostics;
* alerting;
* telemetry metadata;
* correlation;
* security observability;
* privacy;
* retention;
* governance;
* validation;
* release evidence.

The framework enables FamilyOS to answer questions such as:

* What happened?
* When did it happen?
* Which component was involved?
* Which operation was executing?
* Which request, job, workflow, release, or user context was involved?
* Did the operation succeed or fail?
* How long did it take?
* Which dependencies participated?
* What state was the system in?
* Which telemetry signals are correlated?
* Is the system healthy?
* Is it ready?
* Is an alert warranted?
* Can the event be investigated safely?
* Does the telemetry expose sensitive information?
* Is observability sufficient for release and operation?

---

## Observability Problem Statement

FamilyOS may progressively contain:

* command-line interfaces;
* services;
* plugins;
* scheduled jobs;
* automation;
* external integrations;
* release pipelines;
* background processing;
* persistent data;
* security-sensitive operations;
* family-facing workflows.

Without a coherent observability model, components could independently produce telemetry with:

* inconsistent naming;
* incompatible metadata;
* missing correlation;
* excessive noise;
* insufficient diagnostic value;
* privacy leaks;
* secret exposure;
* vendor-specific coupling;
* ambiguous health semantics;
* unreliable alerts;
* incomplete release evidence.

EPIC-OBS-001 establishes shared observability semantics for the entire FamilyOS engineering ecosystem.

---

## Observability Principles

The framework is founded on several core principles.

These include:

```text
Useful Before Extensive
Structured Before Free-Form
Correlatable by Default
Context-Rich
Privacy-Aware
Security-Aware
Failure-Visible
Health-Explicit
Vendor-Neutral
Testable
Automatable
Proportional
Operationally Actionable
```

These principles apply throughout the complete observability lifecycle.

---

## Useful Before Extensive

Observability SHOULD prioritize actionable information over raw telemetry volume.

More telemetry does not automatically produce better observability.

Signals SHOULD help answer meaningful engineering and operational questions.

---

## Structured Before Free-Form

Where practical, telemetry SHOULD use structured data rather than rely entirely on unstructured text.

Structured telemetry improves:

* filtering;
* aggregation;
* correlation;
* machine processing;
* validation;
* testing;
* portability.

Free-form messages may still provide human-readable context.

---

## Correlatable by Default

Related telemetry SHOULD be correlatable.

Correlation identifiers may represent:

* request;
* operation;
* trace;
* workflow;
* job;
* release;
* execution;
* plugin activity.

Correlation allows individual signals to be reconstructed into a broader execution story.

---

## Context-Rich Observability

Useful telemetry SHOULD contain sufficient context to understand what occurred.

Context may include:

* timestamp;
* component;
* operation;
* outcome;
* duration;
* correlation identifier;
* environment;
* version;
* plugin;
* error category;
* release identity.

Context SHALL remain proportional and privacy-aware.

---

## Privacy-Aware Observability

Observability SHALL NOT assume that all available information should be recorded.

Telemetry SHOULD avoid unnecessary exposure of:

* personal data;
* private family data;
* secrets;
* credentials;
* tokens;
* encryption keys;
* authentication material;
* sensitive document contents.

Data minimization applies to telemetry.

---

## Security-Aware Observability

Observability can provide important security evidence.

Security-relevant signals may include:

* authentication failures;
* authorization failures;
* policy failures;
* suspicious operations;
* repeated denied requests;
* unexpected configuration changes;
* release integrity failures.

Security-sensitive telemetry SHALL itself be protected appropriately.

---

## Failure Visibility

Failures SHOULD be observable.

A system SHALL NOT rely exclusively on silent failure handling.

Useful failure telemetry may identify:

* operation;
* component;
* failure class;
* context;
* correlation;
* recoverability;
* retry state;
* relevant diagnostic details.

---

## Explicit Health

Health and readiness SHALL have explicit semantics.

A component reporting:

```text
RUNNING
```

does not necessarily imply:

```text
READY
```

or:

```text
HEALTHY
```

Health states SHOULD reflect meaningful operational conditions.

---

## Vendor Neutrality

The framework SHALL avoid binding FamilyOS observability semantics to one telemetry vendor or backend.

Core concepts SHOULD remain independent from specific products.

Adapters may connect canonical FamilyOS telemetry to external observability platforms.

---

## Testability

Observability behavior SHOULD be testable without requiring production telemetry infrastructure.

Tests may validate:

* emitted events;
* structured fields;
* correlation;
* log levels;
* metrics;
* health transitions;
* alerts;
* privacy rules;
* diagnostic behavior.

---

## Automation

Repeatable observability validation SHOULD be automated where practical.

Automation may verify:

* telemetry schemas;
* required metadata;
* metric registration;
* trace propagation;
* health checks;
* alert rules;
* sensitive-data restrictions.

---

## Observability Architecture

The Observability Architecture defines how telemetry flows through FamilyOS.

Conceptually:

```text
Application / Plugin / Service
            ↓
Observability API
            ↓
Canonical Telemetry Model
            ↓
Processors / Enrichment
            ↓
Exporters / Sinks
            ↓
Logs / Metrics / Traces / Events
            ↓
Analysis / Diagnostics / Alerting
```

This architecture separates application semantics from telemetry infrastructure.

---

## Observability API

Components SHOULD depend on stable observability abstractions.

The API may expose capabilities for:

* logging;
* metrics;
* traces;
* events;
* health reporting;
* diagnostics;
* correlation.

Application code SHOULD avoid depending directly on vendor-specific telemetry APIs where practical.

---

## Canonical Telemetry Model

A canonical telemetry record may include:

```text
timestamp
signal_type
event_name
component
operation
severity
outcome
duration
correlation_id
trace_id
span_id
version
environment
attributes
```

Not every field applies to every signal.

The model SHOULD remain extensible.

---

## Logging

Logging provides discrete records describing significant events.

Logs SHOULD normally be:

* structured where practical;
* severity-aware;
* context-rich;
* correlatable;
* privacy-aware.

Logging SHALL NOT become the default storage mechanism for arbitrary application data.

---

## Log Levels

Typical severity semantics may include:

```text
TRACE
DEBUG
INFO
WARNING
ERROR
CRITICAL
```

Exact implementation may vary.

Severity SHOULD communicate operational significance rather than developer preference.

---

## Metrics

Metrics represent measurable system characteristics over time.

Examples include:

* request count;
* failure count;
* duration;
* queue depth;
* retry count;
* active operations;
* resource usage;
* plugin activity;
* release metrics.

Metrics SHOULD use stable names and meaningful dimensions.

---

## Metric Cardinality

Metric labels SHALL be designed carefully.

High-cardinality dimensions can create excessive cost and poor system behavior.

Potentially dangerous dimensions include:

* unrestricted user identifiers;
* arbitrary document IDs;
* raw URLs;
* unbounded error messages;
* random values.

Dimensions SHOULD remain bounded where practical.

---

## Tracing

Tracing represents causal or temporal relationships across operations.

A trace may contain multiple spans.

Conceptually:

```text
Trace
 ├── Span A
 │    ├── Span B
 │    └── Span C
 └── Span D
```

Tracing can help explain distributed or layered execution.

---

## Span Context

A span may contain:

* operation name;
* start time;
* end time;
* duration;
* parent relationship;
* status;
* attributes;
* events;
* error details.

Span attributes SHALL follow privacy and security constraints.

---

## Events

Structured events may represent significant domain or operational transitions.

Examples include:

```text
familyos.capability.started
familyos.capability.completed
familyos.capability.failed
deployment.completed
rollback.completed
migration.completed
```

Event naming SHOULD be stable and governed.

---

## Health

Health describes whether a component is functioning adequately.

Health MAY distinguish states such as:

```text
HEALTHY
DEGRADED
UNHEALTHY
UNKNOWN
```

Exact state semantics SHALL remain explicit.

---

## Readiness

Readiness answers whether a component is able to accept or perform intended work.

A component may be running while not ready.

Examples:

* required dependency unavailable;
* initialization incomplete;
* migration pending;
* configuration invalid;
* secret unavailable.

---

## Liveness

Liveness indicates whether a process or component remains alive enough to continue execution.

Liveness SHALL NOT be treated as equivalent to readiness or full health.

---

## Diagnostics

Diagnostics provide deeper information for troubleshooting.

Diagnostic capabilities may expose:

* subsystem state;
* dependency state;
* configuration summaries;
* plugin state;
* queue state;
* recent failures;
* correlation information.

Diagnostic interfaces SHALL avoid exposing secrets or unnecessary sensitive information.

---

## Alerting

Alerts identify conditions requiring attention.

An alert SHOULD correspond to an actionable condition.

Poor alerts may be:

* too noisy;
* too broad;
* not actionable;
* poorly prioritized;
* missing context.

Alerting SHOULD optimize for useful action rather than maximum alert volume.

---

## Alert Severity

Alert severity SHOULD reflect:

* user impact;
* service impact;
* security impact;
* data impact;
* release impact;
* urgency;
* recoverability.

Severity models SHOULD remain explicit and stable.

---

## Observability Data

Observability data may include:

* logs;
* metric samples;
* traces;
* events;
* health records;
* diagnostics;
* alerts;
* audit-adjacent evidence.

Telemetry SHALL have appropriate ownership and governance.

---

## Correlation

Correlation connects telemetry related to the same execution context.

Possible identifiers include:

```text
correlation_id
trace_id
span_id
request_id
operation_id
job_id
release_id
```

Identifiers SHOULD be propagated consistently where relevant.

---

## Correlation Boundary

Correlation SHALL remain useful without becoming a privacy liability.

Identifiers SHOULD avoid embedding unnecessary personal or secret data.

---

## Time

Reliable timestamps are essential to observability.

Telemetry SHOULD use consistent clock representation.

Where ordering matters, systems SHOULD account for:

* clock skew;
* asynchronous execution;
* buffering;
* delayed export;
* distributed components.

---

## Retention

Telemetry retention SHOULD reflect:

* diagnostic value;
* legal constraints;
* privacy;
* security;
* storage cost;
* operational need.

Not all telemetry requires indefinite retention.

---

## Data Minimization

Telemetry SHOULD contain the minimum information reasonably required for its observability purpose.

Observability SHALL NOT become an uncontrolled duplicate data store.

---

## Security and Privacy

Observability intersects with Security.

Telemetry may reveal:

* system structure;
* user behavior;
* identifiers;
* error details;
* operational patterns;
* release metadata.

The framework SHALL therefore integrate:

* access control;
* minimization;
* secret filtering;
* retention policy;
* encryption where appropriate;
* governance.

---

## Secret Redaction

Secrets SHALL NOT be intentionally emitted into telemetry.

Examples include:

* passwords;
* bearer tokens;
* API keys;
* private keys;
* secret configuration;
* authentication cookies.

Redaction and filtering MAY provide additional protection but SHALL NOT replace careful telemetry design.

---

## Personally Sensitive Data

FamilyOS may handle personal or family-sensitive information.

Telemetry SHOULD avoid storing such information unless required for a legitimate operational purpose and appropriately governed.

---

## Observability Governance

Governance defines:

* naming conventions;
* schema ownership;
* retention;
* privacy;
* security;
* access;
* alert ownership;
* metric ownership;
* change control.

Observability governance SHOULD prevent uncontrolled fragmentation.

---

## Implementation

The framework provides implementation direction while remaining technology-neutral.

Possible abstractions include:

```text
Logger
Meter
Tracer
EventEmitter
HealthReporter
DiagnosticProvider
CorrelationContext
TelemetryExporter
```

These concepts may evolve as implementation progresses.

---

## Automation

Observability automation may include:

* telemetry validation;
* schema validation;
* metric registration checks;
* trace-context tests;
* alert-rule validation;
* sensitive-data checks;
* health-check tests;
* integration validation.

Automation SHALL produce evidence rather than silently mask telemetry failures.

---

## Testing

Observability features SHOULD be testable.

Testing may validate:

* emitted structured logs;
* expected events;
* metric increments;
* trace relationships;
* health-state transitions;
* correlation propagation;
* privacy behavior.

EPIC-TST-001 remains authoritative for general testing architecture.

---

## Quality

EPIC-QLT-001 remains authoritative for the general Quality Framework.

Observability may supply evidence including:

* performance trends;
* failure rates;
* reliability signals;
* diagnostic evidence;
* release metrics.

---

## Build

EPIC-BLD-001 remains authoritative for build engineering.

Observability may provide build-related evidence such as:

* build duration;
* failure classification;
* artifact-generation telemetry;
* dependency-resolution diagnostics.

---

## Release

EPIC-REL-001 remains authoritative for release engineering.

Observability may provide release evidence regarding:

* deployment;
* publication;
* rollback;
* verification;
* release duration;
* release failures.

---

## Security

EPIC-SEC-001 remains authoritative for the Security Framework.

Observability provides signals that Security may consume for:

* investigations;
* authentication monitoring;
* authorization monitoring;
* anomaly analysis;
* operational security evidence.

---

## Framework Boundaries

The Observability Framework owns:

* observability semantics;
* telemetry architecture;
* logging;
* metrics;
* traces;
* health;
* diagnostics;
* alerting;
* correlation;
* observability data governance.

It does not own:

* general testing architecture;
* general quality policy;
* build lifecycle;
* release lifecycle;
* security architecture;
* runtime operations architecture.

---

```

---

## Current Canonical Repository Structure

The normalized current repository contains:

```text
10 numbered documents
+
7 control documents
=
17 canonical files
```

Canonical range:

```text
00 → 09
```

---

## Historical vs Current Structure

Historical publication:

```text
Numbered Documents: 10
Control Documents:    0
Historical Files:    10
```

Current normalized repository:

```text
Numbered Documents: 10
Control Documents:    7
Canonical Files:     17
```

The current control-document layer SHALL NOT be retroactively attributed to the historical publication.

---

## Historical Tag Integrity

Historical tag:

```text
v4.9.0-observability-framework
```

Expected historical commit:

```text
5cb395e5beb973a4b6595eae0f3cb75142261dd7
```

The tag SHALL remain immutable.

Post-release normalization SHALL be represented by a later commit.

---

## Post-Release Normalization

The current activity adds standard FamilyOS framework control documents around the historically published Observability Framework.

Normalization establishes:

* machine-readable metadata;
* current canonical inventory;
* validation evidence;
* revision history;
* navigation;
* lifecycle visibility.

It does not redefine version `4.9.0`.

---

## Current Revalidation

* historical tag validation;
* Ruff;
* MyPy;
* Pytest;
* repository diff validation.

---

## Evidence Rule

Validation SHALL follow:

```text
