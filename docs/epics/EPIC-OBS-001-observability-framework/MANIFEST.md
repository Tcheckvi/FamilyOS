# EPIC-OBS-001 — Observability Framework Manifest

## Document Status

```text
EPIC:                    EPIC-OBS-001
Title:                   Observability Framework
Framework Version:       4.9.0

Historical Publication:  Published
Historical Tag:          v4.9.0-observability-framework
Historical Tag Policy:   Immutable

Current Activity:         Post-Release Revalidation
Repository Validation:   Validated
Final Revalidation:      Validated
```

---

## 1. Purpose

This manifest defines the canonical repository inventory for:

```text
EPIC-OBS-001 — Observability Framework
```

It establishes:

* canonical numbered-document membership;
* canonical control-document membership;
* repository structure;
* document responsibilities;
* historical publication metadata;
* current normalization metadata;
* validation expectations;
* synchronization requirements.

The manifest is authoritative for repository inventory.

It does not replace the normative authority of the numbered Observability Framework documents.

---

## 2. Repository Location

The canonical repository location is:

```text
docs/epics/EPIC-OBS-001-observability-framework/
```

All canonical Observability Framework documents SHALL reside directly within this directory unless a later governed revision explicitly changes the repository layout.

---

## 3. Framework Identity

```text
EPIC ID:                 EPIC-OBS-001
Framework Name:          Observability Framework
Framework Version:       4.9.0
Framework Type:          Engineering Framework
Domain:                  Observability
Historical State:        Published
```

The framework establishes the canonical FamilyOS observability foundation.

---

## 4. Historical Publication

EPIC-OBS-001 was historically published before the current standardized FamilyOS EPIC control-document model was applied.

Historical release:

```text
Tag:                     v4.9.0-observability-framework
Commit:                  5cb395e5beb973a4b6595eae0f3cb75142261dd7
Publication Status:      Published
Tag Policy:              Immutable
```

The historical tag SHALL NOT be moved during post-release normalization.

The current repository representation may therefore differ structurally from the historical tagged representation without invalidating the historical publication.

---

## 5. Historical Repository Structure

At historical publication time, EPIC-OBS-001 consisted of ten numbered documents.

Historical structure:

```text
Numbered Documents:      10
Control Documents:        0
Historical Files:        10
Canonical Range:         00 → 09
```

The historical publication did not contain the seven standardized control documents used by the current FamilyOS framework-governance model.

This distinction SHALL remain explicit.

---

## 6. Current Canonical Structure

The normalized current repository representation consists of:

```text
Numbered Documents:      10
Control Documents:        7
Canonical Files:         17
Canonical Range:         00 → 09
```

Canonical repository equation:

```text
10 numbered documents
+
7 control documents
=
17 canonical files
```

---

## 7. Canonical Numbered Documents

The canonical numbered-document set is:

```text
00-EPIC.md
01-Context-and-Vision.md
02-Observability-Principles.md
03-Observability-Architecture.md
04-Logging-Metrics-and-Tracing.md
05-Health-Diagnostics-and-Alerting.md
06-Observability-Data-and-Correlation.md
07-Security-Privacy-and-Governance.md
08-Implementation-and-Automation.md
09-Validation-and-Release.md
```

The numbered sequence SHALL contain exactly ten documents.

---

## 8. Numbering Contract

The canonical numbered range is:

```text
00 → 09
```

Expected sequence:

```text
00
01
02
03
04
05
06
07
08
09
```

The sequence SHALL contain:

* no missing number;
* no duplicate number;
* no unexpected numbered document;
* no alternate canonical numbering scheme.

---

---

## 22. `EPIC-OBS-001.md`

Purpose:

```text
Provides the consolidated control-level representation of EPIC-OBS-001.
```

It SHOULD summarize:

* identity;
* purpose;
* scope;
* principles;
* architecture;
* deliverables;
* historical publication;
* current structure;
* lifecycle state;
* validation state.

---

## 23. `EPIC.yaml`

Purpose:

```text
Provides the machine-readable canonical contract for EPIC-OBS-001.
```

It SHALL define at minimum:

* EPIC identity;
* version;
* framework type;
* scope;
* deliverables;
* structure;
* historical structure;
* baseline state;
* historical publication identity;

Provides the human-readable orientation and navigation layer for the Observability Framework.
```

It SHOULD explain:

* framework purpose;
* observability principles;
* architecture;
* telemetry domains;
* framework relationships;
* historical publication;
* normalized repository structure;
* current validation state.

---

## 25. `MANIFEST.md`

Purpose:

```text
Defines canonical repository membership and structural expectations.
```

This document is authoritative for current repository inventory.

---

## 26. `CHANGELOG.md`

Purpose:

```text
Records meaningful Observability Framework changes over time.
```

The changelog SHALL distinguish:

* historical framework publication;
* current post-release normalization;
* future framework revisions.

Historical publication SHALL NOT be rewritten as though current control documents existed at release time.

---

## 27. `VALIDATION.md`

Purpose:

```text
Defines and records the validation contract for the normalized Observability Framework repository representation.
```

Validation SHOULD cover:

* YAML;
* filesystem;
* numbering;
* control documents;

* historical publication commit;
* compact historical structure;
* normalization activity;
* validation state;
* future revisions.

---

## 29. Canonical Deliverables

The current normalized canonical deliverable inventory consists of exactly seventeen files:

```text
00-EPIC.md
01-Context-and-Vision.md
02-Observability-Principles.md
03-Observability-Architecture.md
04-Logging-Metrics-and-Tracing.md
05-Health-Diagnostics-and-Alerting.md
06-Observability-Data-and-Correlation.md
07-Security-Privacy-and-Governance.md
08-Implementation-and-Automation.md
09-Validation-and-Release.md
EPIC-OBS-001.md
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

Expected count:

```text
17
```

---

## 30. Inventory Contract

For the normalized repository state:

```text
Declared Files == Actual Files
```

Expected result:

```text
Declared Files:          17
Actual Files:            17
Missing Files:            0
Unexpected Files:         0
```

These values SHALL only become validated after actual repository execution confirms them.

---

## 31. Historical vs Current Structure

Two repository states SHALL remain explicitly distinguishable.

Historical publication:

```text
Tag:                     v4.9.0-observability-framework
Numbered Documents:      10
Control Documents:        0
Historical Files:        10
```

Current normalized repository:

```text
Numbered Documents:      10
Control Documents:        7
Canonical Files:         17
```

The normalized repository SHALL NOT imply that the seven control documents existed in the historical release.

---

## 32. Historical Tag Integrity

The historical release tag is:

```text
v4.9.0-observability-framework
```

Expected historical commit:

```text
5cb395e5beb973a4b6595eae0f3cb75142261dd7
```

Normalization SHALL NOT move or recreate the historical tag.

Required relationship:

```text
historical tag commit
        ≠
future normalization commit
```

The historical tag remains an immutable reference to the original published Observability Framework state.

---

## 33. Repository Synchronization

The following documents SHALL remain structurally synchronized:

```text
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
EPIC-OBS-001.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
CHANGELOG.md
```

Synchronization includes:

* EPIC identity;
* framework version;
* canonical range;
* numbered-document count;
* control-document count;
* canonical-file count;
* historical tag;
* historical commit;
* publication state;
* current revalidation state.

---

## 34. Structure Contract

The current expected structure is:

```text
structure:
  numbered_documents: 10
  canonical_document_range: 00-09
  control_documents: 7
  canonical_files: 17
```

Any deviation requires investigation before current repository revalidation may pass.

---

## 35. Historical Structure Contract

Historical publication structure:

```text
historical_structure:
  numbered_documents: 10
  canonical_document_range: 00-09
  control_documents: 0
  canonical_files: 10
  documentation_model: compact
```

This structure belongs specifically to the published historical state.

---

## 36. Numbered Document Contract

A canonical numbered document SHALL match:

```text
NN-*.md
```

where:

```text
NN ∈ {00, 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09}
```

Exactly one canonical document SHALL exist for each number.

---

## 37. Control Document Contract

Expected control documents:

```text
EPIC-OBS-001.md
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

Missing or unexpected control documents SHALL prevent structural validation from passing unless explicitly governed by a later revision.

---

## 38. Empty File Policy

Canonical files SHALL NOT be empty.

Expected validation result after execution:

```text
Empty Files: 0
```

A zero-byte canonical file SHALL fail repository validation.

---

## 39. Reference Integrity

Local Markdown references SHOULD resolve to existing canonical content where they represent active repository links.

Validation SHALL distinguish:

* active canonical references;
* historical references;
* illustrative examples;
* external references.

Historical text SHALL NOT automatically fail reference validation merely because it describes an earlier repository state.

---

## 40. Placeholder Policy

Potential unresolved markers may include:

```text
TODO
TBD
FIXME
PLACEHOLDER
XXX
TO BE DEFINED
TO BE COMPLETED
```

Validation SHALL distinguish genuine unresolved placeholders from:

* examples;
* placeholder-detection documentation;
* historical text;
* intentionally quoted markers.

Only genuine unresolved blocking placeholders SHALL fail validation.

---

## 41. Join Defect Policy

Documentation normalization SHALL check for accidental malformed word joins introduced during editing.

Examples might include:

```text
observabilityframework
telemetrydata
correlationcontext
healthstatus
historicaltag
canonicalfiles
```

Technical identifiers such as class names, symbols, metric names, event names, or code identifiers SHALL NOT automatically be considered join defects.

---

## 42. Observability Semantic Integrity

Repository validation SHALL confirm that normalization preserves core Observability Framework semantics.

Important areas include:

* structured telemetry;
* logging;
* metrics;
* tracing;
* health;
* readiness;
* liveness;
* diagnostics;
* alerting;
* correlation;
* privacy;
* security;
* governance;
* automation;
* release integration.

Normalization SHALL NOT silently weaken these requirements.

---

## 43. Structured Telemetry Integrity

The framework SHALL preserve preference for structured telemetry where practical.

Conceptually:

```text
Structured Signal
    ↓
Stable Fields
    ↓
Filtering
Aggregation
Correlation
Validation
Automation
```

Free-form text MAY complement structured signals but SHALL NOT replace necessary machine-readable context.

---

## 44. Logging Integrity

Logging semantics SHALL remain coherent regarding:

* severity;
* structure;
* context;
* outcome;
* errors;
* correlation;
* privacy.

Logs SHALL NOT become an uncontrolled storage mechanism for arbitrary application data.

---

## 45. Metrics Integrity

Metric semantics SHALL remain coherent regarding:

* naming;
* units;
* labels;
* dimensions;
* cardinality;
* ownership;
* aggregation.

Unbounded high-cardinality labels SHOULD be avoided.

---

## 46. Tracing Integrity

Tracing SHALL preserve meaningful execution relationships.

Conceptually:

```text
Trace
  ↓
Spans
  ↓
Parent / Child Relationships
  ↓
Events
  ↓
Outcome
```

Trace data SHALL remain correlation-aware and privacy-aware.

---

## 47. Event Integrity

Structured observability events SHOULD use stable names.

Examples may include:

```text
familyos.capability.started
familyos.capability.completed
familyos.capability.failed
deployment.completed
rollback.completed
```

Event semantics SHOULD remain stable enough for automation and diagnostics.

---

## 48. Health Integrity

Health SHALL remain distinct from simple process existence.

Conceptually:

```text
Running
    ≠
Ready
    ≠
Healthy
```

A process may exist while mandatory dependencies or initialization requirements remain unsatisfied.

---

## 49. Readiness Integrity

Readiness SHALL indicate whether a component can perform its intended responsibilities.

Readiness MAY depend on:

* initialization;
* mandatory dependencies;
* required configuration;
* migrations;
* required secrets.

---

## 50. Liveness Integrity

Liveness SHALL indicate whether a process or subsystem remains alive enough to continue operating.

Liveness SHALL NOT be treated as sufficient evidence of readiness or full health.

---

## 51. Diagnostics Integrity

Diagnostics SHOULD expose enough state for troubleshooting while respecting security and privacy.

Diagnostic content SHOULD avoid unnecessary:

* secrets;
* credentials;
* raw personal data;
* protected document contents.

---

## 52. Alerting Integrity

Alerts SHOULD correspond to meaningful and actionable conditions.

Alerting governance SHOULD consider:

* severity;
* ownership;
* routing;
* context;
* noise;
* duplication;
* recoverability.

---

## 53. Correlation Integrity

Correlation SHALL preserve stable relationships between related telemetry.

Potential identifiers include:

```text
correlation_id
trace_id
span_id
request_id
operation_id
job_id
release_id
```

Correlation identifiers SHOULD avoid embedding sensitive data unnecessarily.

---

## 54. Time Integrity

Telemetry timestamps SHOULD use consistent conventions.

Observability architecture SHOULD consider:

* distributed execution;
* asynchronous processing;
* delayed export;
* clock skew;
* buffering.

---

## 55. Telemetry Data Governance

Observability data SHALL remain governed.

Governance may cover:

* access;
* retention;
* privacy;
* security;
* ownership;
* naming;
* schemas;
* alert rules;
* metric dimensions.

---

## 56. Data Minimization

Telemetry SHOULD include only information required for legitimate observability purposes.

Observability SHALL NOT become an uncontrolled replica of FamilyOS domain data.

---

## 57. Secret Protection

Secrets SHALL NOT intentionally appear in observability data.

Examples include:

```text
Passwords
Tokens
API Keys
Private Keys
Encryption Keys
Signing Keys
Authentication Cookies
```

Redaction MAY provide defense in depth but SHALL NOT replace safe instrumentation.

---

## 58. Privacy Integrity

FamilyOS observability SHALL remain privacy-aware.

Telemetry containing personal or family-sensitive information requires clear legitimate purpose and appropriate governance.

---

## 59. Vendor-Neutrality Integrity

The Observability Framework SHOULD remain independent of one specific telemetry vendor.

Core application code SHOULD depend on canonical FamilyOS abstractions where practical.

Vendor integrations MAY be implemented through adapters.

---

## 60. Testing Boundary

EPIC-TST-001 remains authoritative for general testing architecture.

EPIC-OBS-001 defines observability-specific testing requirements.

Relationship:

```text
Observability Requirement
        ↓
Testing Mechanism
        ↓
Observability Evidence
```

The framework SHALL NOT create a competing general testing lifecycle.

---

## 61. Quality Boundary

EPIC-QLT-001 remains authoritative for general quality governance.

Observability may provide quality evidence including:

* latency;
* failure rates;
* operational regressions;
* reliability signals;
* diagnostic evidence.

---

## 62. Build Boundary

EPIC-BLD-001 remains authoritative for build engineering.

Observability may instrument:

* build duration;
* dependency-resolution behavior;
* failures;
* artifact-production events.

Observability SHALL NOT redefine build lifecycle semantics.

---

## 63. Release Boundary

EPIC-REL-001 remains authoritative for release engineering.

Observability may provide:

* deployment telemetry;
* publication evidence;
* rollback telemetry;
* verification outcomes;
* release timing.

Observability SHALL NOT introduce a competing release lifecycle.

---

## 64. Security Boundary

EPIC-SEC-001 remains authoritative for the Security Framework.

Observability supplies signals and evidence that Security may consume.

Observability SHALL apply applicable security controls to telemetry data.

---

## 65. Evidence Model

Observability revalidation follows:

```text
Requirement
    ↓
Validation
    ↓
Observed Result
    ↓
Evidence
    ↓
Decision
```

Claims SHALL follow evidence.

Evidence SHALL NOT be inferred merely from documentation intent.

---

## 66. Validation Categories

The normalized repository SHOULD be validated across:

```text
YAML Parse
YAML Contract
Filesystem Contract
Numbering Integrity
Control Documents
Empty Files
Manifest Synchronization
README Synchronization
EPIC Summary Synchronization
Changelog Synchronization
Revision History Synchronization
State Consistency
Reference Integrity
Placeholder Validation
Join Defect Validation
Observability Principle Consistency
Observability Architecture Consistency
Logging Consistency
Metrics Consistency
Tracing Consistency
Health Consistency
Diagnostics Consistency
Alerting Consistency
Correlation Consistency
Security / Privacy Consistency
Governance Consistency
Framework Boundary Consistency
Historical Tag Integrity
Ruff
MyPy
Pytest
Diff Check
Final Repository State
```

---

## 67. Validation State

The current normalization activity SHALL initially use:

```text
documentation_status: completed
repository_validation_status: validated
final_validation_status: validated
```

These values SHALL remain pending until current repository evidence is actually produced.

---

## 68. Revalidation Transition

Permitted transition:

```text
Validated
        ↓
Repository Checks Executed
        ↓
Evidence Reviewed
        ↓
All Blocking Checks Pass
        ↓
Validated
```

If any blocking requirement fails:

```text
Validated
        ↓
Validation Failure
        ↓
Correction
        ↓
Revalidation
```

---

## 69. Historical Publication State

Historical publication is already complete.

Therefore:

```text
Historical Publication: Published
Historical Tag:          v4.9.0-observability-framework
Historical Tag Policy:   Immutable
```

Post-release normalization SHALL NOT return the historical publication to a pending state.

Only the current normalized repository validation state remains pending.

---

## 70. Historical Validation Text

Historical numbered documents may contain states such as:

```text
PENDING
Ready for Final Validation
Implementation Status: Pending
```

when explicitly representing the state of the historical publication process.

Such text SHALL NOT automatically be treated as the current lifecycle state of the normalized control layer.

---

## 71. Change Governance

Changes to current canonical repository membership require synchronized updates to:

```text
EPIC.yaml
MANIFEST.md
README.md
EPIC-OBS-001.md

## 72. Future Structural Changes

Future versions may extend or reorganize the Observability Framework.

Such changes SHALL:

1. preserve historical release evidence;
2. document migration explicitly;
3. update canonical inventory;
4. update machine-readable metadata;
5. validate references;
6. record revision history;
7. avoid rewriting historical tags.
