## 4.9.0 — Observability Framework

### Historical Status

```text
PUBLISHED
```

Historical release tag:

```text
v4.9.0-observability-framework
```

Historical publication commit:

```text
5cb395e5beb973a4b6595eae0f3cb75142261dd7

## Historical Documentation Model

The original Observability Framework release used the compact FamilyOS framework documentation model.

Historical structure:

```text
Canonical Range:       00 → 09
Numbered Documents:    10
Control Documents:      0
Historical Files:      10
```

The seven standardized control documents used by later FamilyOS framework normalization were not part of the original publication.

This historical fact SHALL remain preserved.

---

## Added in 4.9.0

### Observability Framework Foundation

Established **EPIC-OBS-001 — Observability Framework** as the canonical FamilyOS observability engineering foundation.

The framework introduced a dedicated observability model covering:

* observability principles;
* observability architecture;
* logging;
* metrics;
* tracing;
* events;
* health;
* readiness;
* diagnostics;
* alerting;
* observability data;
* telemetry correlation;
* security;
* privacy;
* governance;
* implementation;
* automation;
* validation;
* release integration.

---

## Canonical Historical Documents

The historical release established the following numbered-document structure:

```text
00-EPIC.md
01-Context-and-Vision.md
02-Observability-Principles.md
03-Observability-Architecture.md
04-Logging-Metrics-and-Tracing.md
05-Health-Diagnostics-and-Alerting.md
06-Observability-Data-and-Correlation.md
07-Security-Privacy-and-Governance.md
08-Implementation-and-Automation.md
09-Validation-and-Release.md
```

Historical numbered-document count:

```text
10
```

---

## Observability Principles

Version `4.9.0` established the foundational FamilyOS Observability Principles.

These include:

```text
Useful Before Extensive
Structured Before Free-Form
Correlatable by Default
Context-Rich
Privacy-Aware
Security-Aware
Failure-Visible
Health-Explicit
Vendor-Neutral
Testable
Automatable
Proportional
Operationally Actionable
```

---

## Structured Telemetry

The framework established structured telemetry as the preferred model where practical.

Structured telemetry improves:

* filtering;
* aggregation;
* correlation;
* machine processing;
* validation;
* testing;
* portability.

Free-form messages may still supplement structured signals.

---

## Correlation

Version `4.9.0` established correlation as a first-class observability requirement.

Potential correlation identifiers include:

```text
correlation_id
trace_id
span_id
request_id
operation_id
job_id
release_id
```

Related telemetry SHOULD be reconstructable into a meaningful execution story.

---

## Context-Rich Telemetry

Telemetry SHOULD carry sufficient context to explain system behavior.

Useful context may include:

* timestamp;
* component;
* operation;
* outcome;
* duration;
* correlation;
* version;
* environment;
* plugin identity;
* release identity.

---

## Privacy-Aware Observability

The framework established privacy-aware telemetry design.

Observability SHOULD avoid unnecessary exposure of:

* personal information;
* private family data;
* document contents;
* credentials;
* secrets;
* tokens;
* cryptographic material.

---

## Security-Aware Observability

The framework recognized observability as an important source of security evidence.

Security-relevant signals may include:

* authentication failures;
* authorization failures;
* denied operations;
* policy violations;
* suspicious activity;
* release-integrity failures.

Telemetry itself SHALL remain appropriately protected.

---

## Observability Architecture

Version `4.9.0` established the canonical Observability Architecture.

Conceptually:

```text
Application / Plugin / Service
            ↓
Observability API
            ↓
Canonical Telemetry Model
            ↓
Processing / Enrichment
            ↓
Exporters / Sinks
            ↓
Logs / Metrics / Traces / Events
            ↓
Analysis / Diagnostics / Alerting
```

The architecture separates application semantics from telemetry infrastructure.

---

## Vendor Neutrality

The framework established vendor neutrality as an important architectural principle.

Core FamilyOS components SHOULD avoid direct dependency on one telemetry backend where practical.

Adapters may connect canonical observability abstractions to external systems.

---

## Logging

Version `4.9.0` established logging guidance covering:

* structure;
* severity;
* context;
* correlation;
* outcomes;
* privacy;
* security.

Logging SHALL NOT become an uncontrolled storage mechanism for arbitrary application data.

---

## Log Severity

Typical severity semantics may include:

```text
TRACE
DEBUG
INFO
WARNING
ERROR
CRITICAL
```

Severity SHOULD represent operational significance.

---

## Metrics

The framework introduced canonical metric guidance.

Metrics may represent:

* operation count;
* failures;
* latency;
* retries;
* queue depth;
* resource usage;
* plugin activity;
* deployment duration;
* rollback count.

---

## Metric Cardinality

Version `4.9.0` established cardinality awareness as an important metric-design requirement.

Potentially dangerous unbounded dimensions include:

* unrestricted user identifiers;
* arbitrary document IDs;
* random identifiers;
* raw URLs;
* free-form errors.

Metric labels SHOULD remain bounded where practical.

---

## Tracing

The framework established tracing as a mechanism for understanding causal and temporal execution relationships.

Conceptually:

```text
Trace
 ├── Span A
 │    ├── Span B
 │    └── Span C
 └── Span D
```

Tracing SHOULD support cross-component diagnosis without unnecessary vendor coupling.

---

## Spans

A span may contain:

* operation name;
* parent relationship;
* start time;
* end time;
* duration;
* status;
* attributes;
* events;
* errors.

Span data SHALL remain subject to privacy and security requirements.

---

## Structured Events

Version `4.9.0` established structured operational events.

Examples include:

```text
familyos.capability.started
familyos.capability.completed
familyos.capability.failed
migration.completed
deployment.completed
rollback.completed
```

Stable event names support automation, testing, and diagnosis.

---

## Health

The framework established explicit health semantics.

Potential health states may include:

```text
HEALTHY
DEGRADED
UNHEALTHY
UNKNOWN
```

Health SHOULD communicate meaningful operational state.

---

## Readiness

Readiness was established as distinct from simple process existence.

A component may be running but not ready because:

* initialization is incomplete;
* required dependencies are unavailable;
* configuration is invalid;
* migrations are pending;
* mandatory secrets are unavailable.

---

## Liveness

Liveness indicates whether a component remains alive enough to continue execution.

Liveness SHALL NOT automatically imply readiness or full health.

---

## Diagnostics

Version `4.9.0` established diagnostics as a deeper troubleshooting capability.

Diagnostics may expose:

* dependency state;
* plugin state;
* initialization state;
* queue state;
* recent failures;
* subsystem health;
* correlation information.

Diagnostics SHALL avoid unnecessary secret or private-data exposure.

---

## Alerting

The framework introduced alerting guidance.

Alerts SHOULD be:

* actionable;
* meaningful;
* sufficiently contextual;
* appropriately prioritized;
* resistant to excessive noise.

Alert volume alone SHALL NOT represent observability quality.

---

## Alert Ownership

An alert SHOULD have identifiable ownership or routing expectations.

Unowned alerts create operational ambiguity and tend to become ignored.

---

## Observability Data

The framework established observability data as governed operational data.

This includes:

* logs;
* metric samples;
* traces;
* events;
* health records;
* diagnostics;
* alerts.

---

## Time and Ordering

Version `4.9.0` established consistent time representation as an important telemetry requirement.

Observability systems SHOULD account for:

* asynchronous processing;
* delayed export;
* buffering;
* clock skew;
* distributed execution.

---

## Telemetry Correlation

Telemetry correlation enables signals across different layers to be associated with common execution contexts.

Conceptually:

```text
Operation
   ↓
Correlation Context
   ↓
Logs
Metrics
Traces
Events
Diagnostics
```

---

## Retention

Observability data SHOULD be retained according to legitimate operational need.

Retention SHOULD consider:

* diagnostic value;
* privacy;
* security;
* legal requirements;
* storage cost;
* operational usefulness.

---

## Data Minimization

Version `4.9.0` established telemetry minimization as an explicit observability requirement.

Observability SHALL NOT become a secondary uncontrolled replica of FamilyOS domain data.

---

## Secret Protection

Secrets SHALL NOT intentionally appear in telemetry.

Examples include:

```text
Passwords
API Keys
Bearer Tokens
Private Keys
Encryption Keys
Signing Keys
Authentication Cookies
```

Redaction may provide defense in depth but does not replace safe instrumentation.

---

## Security and Privacy

The framework integrated security and privacy into observability design.

Governance may cover:

* access;
* retention;
* encryption;
* redaction;
* minimization;
* ownership;
* auditability.

---

## Observability Governance

Version `4.9.0` established governance for:

* naming;
* schemas;
* retention;
* access;
* privacy;
* security;
* metric dimensions;
* alert ownership;
* telemetry lifecycle.

Governance reduces fragmentation across FamilyOS components.

---

## Implementation Direction

The framework established implementation direction while remaining vendor-neutral.

Possible canonical abstractions include:

```text
Logger
Meter
Tracer
EventEmitter
HealthReporter
DiagnosticProvider
CorrelationContext
TelemetryExporter
```

Exact implementation remains subject to engineering evolution.

---

## Automation

Observability automation may include:

* schema validation;
* required-field checks;
* metric-registration checks;
* trace-propagation checks;
* health-state tests;
* privacy validation;
* sensitive-data checks;
* alert-rule validation.

Automation SHOULD expose failures explicitly.

---

## Testing Integration

EPIC-OBS-001 integrates with the FamilyOS Testing Framework.

Observability-specific tests may verify:

* structured logs;
* metrics;
* events;
* trace relationships;
* health transitions;
* diagnostic behavior;
* correlation propagation;
* privacy rules.

---

## Quality Integration

The framework integrates with the Quality Framework.

Observability may provide quality evidence such as:

* latency;
* failure rates;
* reliability trends;
* operational regressions;
* diagnostic findings.

---

## Build Integration

Observability may provide build-related evidence such as:

* build duration;
* stage failures;
* dependency-resolution failures;
* artifact-generation events.

EPIC-BLD-001 remains authoritative for build engineering.

---

## Release Integration

Version `4.9.0` integrated observability with release engineering.

Relevant release signals may include:

```text
deployment.started
deployment.completed
deployment.failed
rollback.started
rollback.completed
release.verification.failed
```

EPIC-REL-001 remains authoritative for the release lifecycle.

---

## Security Integration

The Observability Framework integrates with the Security Framework.

Security may consume observability evidence for:

* investigation;
* authentication monitoring;
* authorization monitoring;
* anomaly analysis;
* runtime control evidence.

EPIC-SEC-001 remains authoritative for security architecture.

---

## Validation

Version `4.9.0` defined observability validation requirements covering:

* framework structure;
* observability semantics;
* telemetry behavior;
* health behavior;
* privacy;
* security;
* repository state;
* release readiness.

---

## Historical Validation State

The historical numbered framework contains pre-publication states such as:

```text
Implementation Status: Pending
Framework Status: Ready for Final Validation
PENDING
```

These values reflect the historical release workflow and SHALL NOT automatically be interpreted as the current control-layer lifecycle state.

---

## Historical Release Completion

Version `4.9.0` was historically completed and published under:

```text
v4.9.0-observability-framework
```

The tag dereferences to:

```text
5cb395e5beb973a4b6595eae0f3cb75142261dd7
```

The framework is therefore historically published.

---

## Historical Tag Integrity

The historical release tag SHALL remain immutable.

The following operations are prohibited during current normalization:

```text
Move historical tag
Delete and recreate historical tag
Force-update historical tag
Point historical tag at normalization commit
Rewrite historical publication commit
```

Current normalization changes belong to later forward repository history.

---

## Post-Release Normalization

After historical publication, the FamilyOS framework-governance model evolved.

EPIC-OBS-001 therefore receives the standardized control-document layer:

```text
EPIC-OBS-001.md
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

This changes the current repository representation to:

```text
10 numbered documents
+
7 control documents
=
17 canonical files
```

---

## Historical vs Current Repository State

Historical release:

```text
Canonical Range:       00 → 09
Numbered Documents:    10
Control Documents:      0
Historical Files:      10
```

Current normalized repository:

```text
Canonical Range:       00 → 09
Numbered Documents:    10
Control Documents:      7
Canonical Files:       17
```

The normalized structure SHALL NOT be retroactively attributed to the historical release.

---

## Current Revalidation

The normalized repository representation requires evidence-based revalidation.

Required checks include:

```text
YAML Parse
YAML Contract
Filesystem Contract
Canonical Inventory
Numbering Integrity
Control Documents
Empty File Check
Manifest Synchronization
README Synchronization
EPIC Summary Synchronization
Changelog Synchronization
Revision History Synchronization
State Consistency
Reference Integrity
Placeholder Validation
Join Defect Validation
Observability Principle Consistency
Observability Architecture Consistency
Logging Consistency
Metrics Consistency
Tracing Consistency
Health Consistency
Diagnostics Consistency
Alerting Consistency
Correlation Consistency
Security / Privacy Consistency
Framework Boundary Consistency
Historical Tag Integrity
Ruff
MyPy
Pytest
Diff Check
Final Repository State
```

---

## Validation Evidence Policy

The required model is:

```text
Execute
    ↓
Observe
    ↓
Evaluate
    ↓
Record
```

The prohibited model is:

```text
Requirement Documented
    ↓
Assume Success
    ↓
Record PASS
```

No current validation check SHALL be declared successful without actual evidence.

---

## Current Normalization State

```text
Framework Version:       4.9.0
Historical Publication:  Published

Historical Tag:          v4.9.0-observability-framework
Historical Commit:       5cb395e5beb973a4b6595eae0f3cb75142261dd7
Historical Tag Policy:   Immutable

Canonical Files:         17

Current Activity:         Post-Release Revalidation
Repository Validation:   Validated
Final Revalidation:      Validated
```

---

## Future Changes

Future Observability Framework revisions may introduce:

* machine-readable telemetry schemas;
* canonical signal registries;
* automated cardinality controls;
* formal correlation schemas;
* standardized health interfaces;
* alert policy models;
* observability profiles;
* runtime telemetry validation;
* richer release observability;
* automated privacy controls;
* telemetry quality metrics;
* observability governance automation.

Such changes SHALL follow normal FamilyOS framework versioning and release governance rather than modifying historical version `4.9.0` in place.

---

## Final Changelog Principle

The canonical historical statement for EPIC-OBS-001 is:

```text
Version:                 4.9.0
Historical Publication:  Published
Historical Tag:          v4.9.0-observability-framework
Historical Commit:       5cb395e5beb973a4b6595eae0f3cb75142261dd7
Historical Tag Policy:   Immutable
```

The current control-document normalization is a post-release repository-governance change.

It preserves the original release identity while bringing EPIC-OBS-001 into alignment with the current FamilyOS framework-control model.
