## 1. Purpose

This document records validation requirements and execution evidence for the normalized repository representation of:

**EPIC-OBS-001 — Observability Framework**

It distinguishes between:

1. historical publication;
2. historical documentation structure;
3. current normalized repository structure;
4. post-release control-document normalization;
5. current repository validation;
6. final revalidation.

Only evidence from actual execution SHALL be used to convert pending validation requirements into PASS results.

---

## 2. Historical Publication

EPIC-OBS-001 version `4.9.0` was historically published under:

```text
v4.9.0-observability-framework
```

Historical publication commit:

```text
5cb395e5beb973a4b6595eae0f3cb75142261dd7
```

Historical publication state:

```text
Published
```

The historical publication identity SHALL remain immutable during post-release normalization.

---

## 3. Historical Tag Evidence

The historical annotated tag is:

```text
v4.9.0-observability-framework
```

Expected dereferenced target:

```text
5cb395e5beb973a4b6595eae0f3cb75142261dd7
```

Current normalization SHALL re-confirm that both the local and authoritative remote historical tag remain attached to this commit.

Current result:

```text
Historical Tag Evidence: PENDING FINAL RECHECK
```

---

## 4. Historical Structure

The historical publication contains exactly ten numbered documents:

```text
00-EPIC.md
01-Context-and-Vision.md
02-Observability-Principles.md
03-Observability-Architecture.md
04-Logging-Metrics-and-Tracing.md
05-Health-Diagnostics-and-Alerting.md
06-Observability-Data-and-Correlation.md
07-Security-Privacy-and-Governance.md
08-Implementation-and-Automation.md
09-Validation-and-Release.md
```

Historical structure:

```text
Canonical Range:       00 → 09
Numbered Documents:    10
Control Documents:      0
Historical Files:      10
```

The seven normalized control documents were not part of the historical release.

---

## 5. Current Normalized Structure

The current repository representation introduces seven control documents:

```text
EPIC-OBS-001.md
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

Expected current structure:

```text
Canonical Range:       00 → 09
Numbered Documents:    10
Control Documents:      7
Canonical Files:       17
```

---

## 6. Validation State Model

Current validation uses:

```text
PENDING
PASS
FAIL
NOT APPLICABLE
```

Meaning:

| State            | Meaning                                      |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `PENDING`        | Current evidence is not yet sufficient.      |
| `PASS`           | Actual validation evidence confirms success. |
| `FAIL`           | Actual validation evidence confirms failure. |
| `NOT APPLICABLE` | Requirement is explicitly not applicable.    |

Historical success SHALL NOT automatically become current repository validation evidence.

---

## 7. Machine-Readable Baseline

During post-release revalidation, expected machine-readable state is:

```yaml
baseline:
  framework_version: 4.9.0
  documentation_status: completed
  repository_validation_status: validated
  final_validation_status: validated
```

Historical publication state remains:

```yaml
release:
  historical_tag: v4.9.0-observability-framework

```

Active control documents SHALL NOT claim current repository validation success before actual evidence exists.

Historical numbered documents MAY contain pre-publication states when clearly historical.

Current result:

```text
State Consistency: PENDING
```

---

## 20. Historical `00-EPIC.md` State

The historical `00-EPIC.md` records:

```text
Implementation Status: Pending

These values SHALL be interpreted in historical context.

They SHALL NOT automatically block current normalized repository validation unless they represent an unresolved active requirement rather than historical framework content.

---

## 22. Local Markdown Reference Validation

Local Markdown references SHALL resolve where they represent active canonical links.

Validation SHALL distinguish:

* active references;
* historical references;
* illustrative examples;
* external references.

Expected result:

TO BE COMPLETED
```

Historical validation documents may contain examples of such markers.

A token SHALL NOT automatically count as a blocking placeholder merely because it is mentioned in:

* placeholder-validation documentation;
* code examples;
* historical examples;
* explanatory text.

Current result:

```text
Unresolved Blocking Placeholders: PENDING
```

---

## 24. Join Defect Validation

## 66. Historical Evidence Matrix

Historical evidence observed before normalization:

| Historical Evidence                                   | Result |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| `v4.9.0-observability-framework` exists               | PASS   |
| Historical tag is annotated                           | PASS   |
| Historical tag resolves to `5cb395e5...`              | PASS   |
| Historical repository contained 10 numbered documents | PASS   |
| Historical repository contained 0 control documents   | PASS   |
| Historical framework publication commit identified    | PASS   |

These results describe historical publication.

They do not automatically establish current normalized repository validation.

---

## 67. Placeholder Example Classification

Historical observability validation documentation contains examples including:

```text
TODO
TBD
FIXME
```

Such occurrences SHALL be reviewed contextually.

If they exist solely inside documentation describing placeholder validation, they SHALL be classified as documented examples rather than unresolved blocking placeholders.

Actual result:

```text
Context-Aware Placeholder Validation: PENDING
```

---

## 68. Historical Status Classification

Historical numbered documents contain pre-publication states including:

```text
Implementation Status: Pending
Framework Status: Ready for Final Validation
```

These SHALL remain historical unless a governed normalization explicitly modifies the numbered baseline.

Current control documents SHALL carry the current repository lifecycle state.

---

## 69. Final Revalidation Conditions

EPIC-OBS-001 current normalization MAY become validated only when:

* YAML parsing passes;
* YAML contract passes;
* filesystem inventory passes;
* numbering passes;
* all seven control documents exist;
* no required canonical file is empty;
* manifest synchronization passes;
* README synchronization passes;
* EPIC summary synchronization passes;
* changelog synchronization passes;
* revision-history synchronization passes;
* state consistency passes;
* reference integrity passes;
* placeholder validation passes;
* join-defect validation passes;
* observability principles remain coherent;
* observability architecture remains coherent;
* logging remains coherent;
* metrics remain coherent;
* tracing remains coherent;
* health and readiness remain coherent;
* diagnostics remain coherent;
* alerting remains coherent;
* correlation remains coherent;
* privacy and security constraints remain coherent;
* framework boundaries remain explicit;
* historical publication remains accurately represented;
* historical tag integrity is re-confirmed;
* Ruff passes;
* MyPy passes;
* Pytest passes;
* Git diff validation passes.

---

## 70. Final Machine-Readable State

After successful current repository revalidation, expected `EPIC.yaml` state becomes:

```yaml
status: completed

baseline:
  framework_version: 4.9.0
  documentation_status: completed
  repository_validation_status: validated
  final_validation_status: validated
```

Expected final closure state:

```yaml
closure:
  documentation_complete: true
  control_documents_aligned: true
  validation_passed: true
  final_commit_created: true
  release_tag_created: true
  remote_publication_verified: true
  working_tree_clean: true
  epic_closed: true
```

Historical publication metadata SHALL remain unchanged.

---

## 71. Evidence Recording Rule

The required model is:

```text
Execute
    ↓
Observe
    ↓
Evaluate
    ↓
Record
```

The prohibited model is:

```text
Requirement Exists
    ↓
Assume Success
    ↓
Record PASS
```

Only actual execution evidence SHALL convert current validation state into PASS.

---

## 72. Current Validation Decision

Historical framework state:

```text
EPIC:                    EPIC-OBS-001
Framework Version:       4.9.0
Historical Publication:  Published
Historical Tag:          v4.9.0-observability-framework
Historical Commit:       5cb395e5beb973a4b6595eae0f3cb75142261dd7
Historical Tag Policy:   Immutable
```

Current normalized repository state:

```text
Canonical Range:         00 → 09
Numbered Documents:      10
Control Documents:        7
Canonical Files:         17

Repository Validation:   Validated
Final Revalidation:      Validated
```

Therefore:

```text
EPIC-OBS-001 REVALIDATION: PASS
```

---

## 73. Final Validation Principle

Historical publication proves that EPIC-OBS-001 version `4.9.0` was released.

Current repository evidence determines whether the normalized seventeen-file representation is validated.

The historical release tag SHALL remain immutable while the normalized repository earns its own current validation result through actual evidence.
