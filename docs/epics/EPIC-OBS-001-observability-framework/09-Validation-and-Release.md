# Observability Framework

## 09 Validation and Release

### Overview

Validation and release define how the FamilyOS Observability Framework is verified, accepted, versioned, and established as an official engineering capability.

The framework is not considered complete merely because its documentation exists.

It must demonstrate that its architecture, telemetry model, signal conventions, privacy controls, security boundaries, operational expectations, and framework integrations form a coherent and usable whole.

Validation therefore verifies both:

* the quality of the framework definition;
* the readiness of the framework to guide implementation and operational adoption.

Release then establishes one immutable and traceable framework baseline.

The governing principle is:

> The Observability Framework must be validated as an integrated engineering system before it is released as a normative FamilyOS foundation.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to define the validation and release model for the FamilyOS Observability Framework.

It establishes expectations for:

* structural validation;
* content validation;
* cross-document consistency;
* architectural validation;
* telemetry validation;
* privacy validation;
* security validation;
* plugin integration validation;
* release integration validation;
* operational scenario validation;
* framework acceptance;
* release preparation;
* versioning;
* repository verification;
* tagging;
* publication;
* post-release verification.

This document forms the final transition from framework definition to official framework baseline.

---

## Validation Objectives

Validation must establish confidence in several dimensions.

### Structural Completeness

All required framework artifacts must exist.

### Conceptual Completeness

The framework must cover the required observability domains.

### Internal Consistency

Documents must not define conflicting telemetry or architectural semantics.

### Architectural Integrity

The framework must remain aligned with FamilyOS engineering architecture.

### Operational Applicability

The framework must support real runtime and diagnostic scenarios.

### Security

Telemetry architecture must preserve security boundaries.

### Privacy

Observability requirements must not create uncontrolled exposure of family data.

### Integrability

The framework must integrate with Build, Testing, Quality, Release, Security, and plugin architecture.

---

## Validation Scope

Validation applies to the complete Observability Framework.

The scope includes:

* context and vision;
* observability principles;
* observability architecture;
* logging;
* metrics;
* tracing;
* health;
* alerting;
* operational diagnostics;
* telemetry correlation;
* security;
* privacy;
* plugin observability;
* release observability integration;
* validation;
* roadmap or implementation guidance where applicable;
* framework metadata and control artifacts.

Validation must consider the framework as one system.

---

## Validation Model

The validation process should proceed through several levels.

```text
Structure Validation
        |
        v
Document Validation
        |
        v
Cross-Document Validation
        |
        v
Architecture Validation
        |
        v
Operational Scenario Validation
        |
        v
Framework Acceptance
```

Each level verifies a different class of defect.

---

## Structural Validation

Structural validation verifies the expected repository state.

Checks should include:

* framework directory exists;
* expected numbered documents exist;
* required control documents exist;
* files are non-empty;
* numbering is unique;
* filenames follow canonical conventions;
* no unintended legacy documents remain;
* no accidental temporary files are treated as canonical.

Structural correctness is a prerequisite for deeper validation.

---

## Canonical Inventory Validation

The expected framework inventory should be defined in the framework manifest or equivalent control artifact.

Validation must compare:

```text
Expected Inventory
        |
        v
Actual Repository Inventory
        |
        v
Difference Analysis
```

The expected result is:

```text
missing_files = []
unexpected_canonical_files = []
duplicate_numbers = []
```

Any difference must be reviewed.

---

## Empty File Validation

Required framework documents must contain substantive content.

A file satisfying:

```text
size > 0
```

is not necessarily complete.

Validation must distinguish between:

```text
NON_EMPTY
```

and:

```text
SUBSTANTIVE
```

Placeholder-only documents do not satisfy completion requirements.

---

## Numbering Validation

Numbered framework documents must use unique identifiers.

The following invariant must hold:

```text
count(numbered_documents)
==
count(unique_numeric_prefixes)
```

Duplicate numeric prefixes are blocking structural defects.

---

## Naming Validation

Canonical files should follow stable naming conventions.

Validation should check:

* consistent numeric prefixes;
* descriptive file names;
* expected `.md` extension;
* no alternate filenames for the same canonical topic;
* no accidental case inconsistencies.

Stable naming is required for navigation and automation.

---

## Document Validation

Each numbered document should be reviewed independently.

Document-level validation should evaluate:

* correct title;
* clear purpose;
* coherent scope;
* architecture alignment;
* substantive content;
* terminology;
* required outcomes;
* absence of unresolved placeholders;
* relationship with adjacent framework topics.

The exact heading model may vary, but consistency should remain high.

---

## Terminology Validation

Core observability terms must have consistent meaning across documents.

Important terms include:

```text
observability
telemetry
signal
log
metric
trace
span
event
health
readiness
liveness
correlation
instrumentation
collector
alert
```

Terminology drift reduces architectural clarity.

---

## Logging Validation

Logging requirements should be checked for consistency.

Validation should confirm that:

* production logging is structured;
* severity semantics are defined;
* logs support correlation;
* secrets are prohibited;
* sensitive domain payloads are restricted;
* duplicate exception logging is discouraged;
* release identity can be included where useful.

Logging must remain operationally useful without becoming a privacy risk.

---

## Metrics Validation

Metric requirements should be validated for:

* naming consistency;
* unit clarity;
* controlled dimensions;
* cardinality limits;
* stable semantics;
* aggregation behavior;
* operational purpose.

A metric should not exist without a meaningful use case.

Validation must specifically detect dangerous high-cardinality design patterns.

---

## Tracing Validation

Tracing requirements should confirm:

* traces use stable execution semantics;
* spans represent meaningful boundaries;
* parent-child relationships are supported;
* trace context propagates correctly;
* trace attributes avoid sensitive payloads;
* sampling behavior is understood;
* failed operations remain diagnosable.

Tracing must remain useful without creating excessive runtime overhead.

---

## Signal Correlation Validation

The architecture should support correlation between telemetry signals.

Validation should confirm that an operator can conceptually move through:

```text
Metric Alert
    |
    v
Affected Component
    |
    v
Relevant Logs
    |
    v
Trace
    |
    v
Execution Cause
```

If signals cannot be correlated, observability remains fragmented.

---

## Common Context Validation

Common operational context should be consistent across the framework.

Typical fields may include:

```text
environment
service
component
plugin_id
release_version
deployment_id
operation
correlation_id
trace_id
```

Not every field belongs on every signal.

Validation should confirm semantic consistency rather than force unnecessary fields.

---

## Health Validation

Health architecture must distinguish between meaningful operational states.

Validation should confirm definitions for concepts such as:

```text
LIVENESS
READINESS
DEGRADED
UNHEALTHY
```

A process being alive must not automatically imply that the component is ready.

---

## Missing Telemetry Validation

The framework must explicitly distinguish missing telemetry from healthy behavior.

The following must never be assumed:

```text
no_signal
=
healthy
```

Instead:

```text
no_signal
=
unknown_or_observability_failure
```

depending on context.

This is a mandatory validation invariant.

---

## Observability Pipeline Validation

The telemetry path should be conceptually valid from producer to consumer.

```text
Runtime
  |
  v
Instrumentation
  |
  v
Signal
  |
  v
Collector
  |
  v
Processing
  |
  v
Storage
  |
  v
Analysis / Alerting
```

Each stage should have a defined responsibility.

---

## Collector Validation

Collector behavior should be evaluated for:

* batching;
* buffering;
* filtering;
* enrichment;
* routing;
* bounded resource use.

Collectors must not create uncontrolled runtime dependencies.

---

## Telemetry Failure Validation

The framework must define acceptable behavior when telemetry systems fail.

Representative scenario:

```text
Application Operation
        |
        +--> Business Result = SUCCESS
        |
        +--> Telemetry Export = FAILURE
```

For non-critical telemetry paths, the business operation should generally remain unaffected.

The telemetry failure itself should become observable where practical.

---

## Bounded Failure Validation

Telemetry failures must have bounded blast radius.

Validation should confirm that:

* buffer growth is bounded;
* retry behavior is bounded;
* exporter failure cannot indefinitely block business operations;
* plugin telemetry failure does not cause platform-wide failure.

This is a core resilience requirement.

---

## Privacy Validation

Privacy validation is mandatory because FamilyOS may process highly sensitive information.

Validation must verify that observability rules prohibit uncontrolled collection of:

* passwords;
* tokens;
* private keys;
* private communications;
* document contents;
* health information;
* financial details;
* unrelated personal payloads.

Operational metadata should be preferred.

---

## Data Minimization Validation

Each telemetry field should have a justified operational purpose.

Validation should ask:

```text
Is this field necessary for:
- monitoring?
- diagnosis?
- security?
- reliability?
- release verification?
```

If not, collection should be reconsidered.

---

## Redaction Validation

The framework should support redaction before sensitive information leaves the producing boundary.

Conceptually:

```text
Runtime Context
      |
      v
Telemetry Sanitization
      |
      +--> Safe Metadata
      |
      X--> Restricted Value
```

Validation should ensure that redaction is treated as an architectural requirement rather than an optional operator practice.

---

## Security Validation

Observability infrastructure must preserve security boundaries.

Validation should confirm requirements for:

* authentication;
* authorization;
* secure transport;
* storage protection;
* restricted access to sensitive telemetry;
* auditability.

Telemetry systems must not become alternate paths around FamilyOS security controls.

---

## Plugin Validation

Plugins must participate in the common observability model.

Validation should confirm that plugins:

* use common telemetry interfaces where applicable;
* identify plugin context;
* follow logging conventions;
* respect cardinality rules;
* propagate tracing context;
* obey privacy requirements;
* cannot freely access unrelated telemetry.

Plugin observability must not create isolated telemetry silos.

---

## Plugin Failure Scenario

A representative scenario should validate:

```text
Plugin Operation
      |
      v
Failure
      |
      +--> Plugin-specific ERROR log
      |
      +--> Failure metric
      |
      +--> Failed trace span
      |
      v
Platform Diagnosis
```

The platform should be able to isolate the plugin as the failure source.

---

## Dependency Validation

Critical dependency observability should be validated.

The framework should support differentiation between:

```text
FamilyOS Failure
```

and:

```text
External Dependency Failure
```

Relevant evidence may include:

* latency;
* failures;
* timeouts;
* trace spans;
* dependency health.

---

## Release Integration Validation

The Observability Framework must integrate with the Release Framework.

Validation should confirm support for:

```text
release_version
deployment_id
artifact identity where applicable
deployment markers
release verification
rollback observation
recovery verification
```

This enables runtime behavior to be associated with release state.

---

## Release Scenario Validation

A representative release scenario should demonstrate:

```text
Deployment Started
      |
      v
Deployment Marker
      |
      v
New Release Active
      |
      v
Runtime Metrics
      |
      v
Verification
      |
      v
Release Accepted
```

The framework must provide sufficient observability for this sequence.

---

## Regression Scenario Validation

A failure scenario should demonstrate:

```text
Release Deployment
      |
      v
Latency Increase
      |
      v
Metric Alert
      |
      v
Trace Analysis
      |
      v
Plugin / Dependency Isolation
      |
      v
Rollback Decision
```

This validates the usefulness of cross-signal correlation.

---

## Recovery Validation

Observability must remain active during rollback and recovery.

Validation should confirm visibility for:

* rollback start;
* target version;
* deployment transition;
* restored health;
* verification;
* rollback completion.

Recovery must not become an operational blind spot.

---

## Build Integration Validation

The framework should consume build metadata where useful.

Examples include:

```text
build_id
artifact_id
artifact_digest
source_revision
```

Validation should confirm that observability can correlate runtime behavior with a known engineering artifact where required.

---

## Testing Integration Validation

Observability capabilities should be testable without depending on production telemetry infrastructure.

Validation should confirm that tests can verify:

* log event generation;
* metric recording;
* trace creation;
* context propagation;
* health transitions;
* redaction.

Instrumentation must remain testable.

---

## Quality Integration Validation

The Quality Framework may consume observability quality indicators.

Validation should confirm that observability supports measurable concepts such as:

* telemetry completeness;
* alert quality;
* correlation coverage;
* health signal reliability;
* diagnostic usefulness.

Observability quality must be capable of improvement over time.

---

## Performance Validation

Instrumentation must have bounded overhead.

Validation should consider:

* serialization cost;
* signal volume;
* exporter behavior;
* tracing overhead;
* log volume;
* metric cardinality.

Observability must not create unacceptable runtime degradation.

---

## Cardinality Validation

Metric and telemetry dimensions should be reviewed explicitly.

Prohibited or strongly discouraged metric dimensions include unrestricted:

```text
user_id
document_id
correlation_id
request_id
free_text_error
```

unless a specific architecture justifies and controls them.

High-cardinality diagnostic data belongs primarily in logs or traces.

---

## Sampling Validation

If tracing uses sampling, validation should confirm:

* sampling is intentional;
* configuration is visible;
* critical failures remain diagnosable;
* missing traces are not misinterpreted;
* sampling does not systematically hide important failure classes.

---

## Alerting Validation

Alert definitions should be validated for:

* clear signal source;
* defined condition;
* severity;
* ownership;
* expected response.

An alert without an actionable response path should be reconsidered.

---

## Alert Noise Validation

The framework should include mechanisms for identifying:

* duplicate alerts;
* false positives;
* obsolete rules;
* noisy thresholds.

High alert volume is not evidence of strong observability.

---

## Operational Scenario Validation

The framework should be tested conceptually against representative operational scenarios.

At minimum:

```text
Normal Operation
Plugin Failure
Dependency Failure
Release Regression
Telemetry Backend Failure
Security Event
Rollback and Recovery
```

Each scenario should have a clear observation and diagnosis path.

---

## Normal Operation Scenario

A normal operation should demonstrate:

```text
Operation
  |
  +--> relevant metric
  |
  +--> optional structured log
  |
  +--> trace where appropriate
  |
  v
Successful Completion
```

Telemetry volume should remain proportionate.

---

## Dependency Failure Scenario

A dependency failure should produce sufficient evidence to determine:

* which dependency failed;
* what operation was affected;
* how often failure occurs;
* whether retries occurred;
* whether platform behavior degraded.

The failure must not appear indistinguishable from an internal application defect.

---

## Telemetry Backend Failure Scenario

The framework must support a scenario where telemetry export fails.

Expected behavior may be:

```text
Telemetry Backend Unavailable
        |
        v
Exporter Failure
        |
        +--> bounded buffering / controlled dropping
        |
        +--> observability health degraded
        |
        v
Application Continues Where Safe
```

This validates observability resilience.

---

## Security Event Scenario

A security-related event should demonstrate:

* controlled telemetry generation;
* appropriate severity;
* restricted access;
* absence of secret exposure;
* traceability.

Security evidence must remain useful without leaking protected information.

---

## Validation Status

The framework should expose a final validation state.

Recommended states are:

```text
PASS
PASS_WITH_FINDINGS
FAIL
PENDING
```

### PASS

All mandatory validation requirements are satisfied.

### PASS_WITH_FINDINGS

The framework is valid but non-blocking improvements remain.

### FAIL

One or more mandatory requirements are not satisfied.

### PENDING

Validation is incomplete.

---

## Validation Findings

Findings should use a consistent severity model.

Recommended levels include:

```text
CRITICAL
HIGH
MEDIUM
LOW
INFO
```

Critical and high blocking findings should prevent framework release unless explicitly governed otherwise.

---

## Finding Record

A finding may include:

```text
finding_id
area
description
severity
evidence
owner
status
resolution
```

Findings should remain traceable until resolved or explicitly accepted.

---

## Validation Checklist

A final framework validation checklist should include:

```text
[ ] Canonical inventory is complete
[ ] Required files are substantive
[ ] Numbering is unique
[ ] Naming is consistent
[ ] Architecture is coherent
[ ] Signal types are clearly defined
[ ] Logging conventions are defined
[ ] Metric semantics are defined
[ ] Cardinality rules are defined
[ ] Tracing semantics are defined
[ ] Correlation model is defined
[ ] Health model is defined
[ ] Missing telemetry semantics are defined
[ ] Telemetry failure behavior is bounded
[ ] Plugin integration is defined
[ ] Dependency observability is defined
[ ] Privacy requirements are defined
[ ] Security requirements are defined
[ ] Release integration is defined
[ ] Testing integration is defined
[ ] Quality integration is defined
[ ] Representative scenarios are supported
[ ] Blocking findings = 0
```

This checklist forms the minimum acceptance baseline.

---

## Repository Validation

Repository-level validation should verify the actual framework state.

Useful checks may include:

```bash
EPIC_DIR="docs/epics/EPIC-OBS-001-observability-framework"

printf '\n=== STRUCTURE ===\n'
find "$EPIC_DIR" -maxdepth 1 -type f | sort

printf '\n=== EMPTY FILES ===\n'
find "$EPIC_DIR" -maxdepth 1 -type f -empty -print | sort

printf '\n=== NUMBERED DOCUMENTS ===\n'
find "$EPIC_DIR" -maxdepth 1 -type f \
  -name '[0-9][0-9]-*.md' \
  -exec basename {} \; | sort
```

The actual EPIC directory name must match the canonical repository structure.

---

## Duplicate Number Validation

Duplicate numbers may be checked with:

```bash
find "$EPIC_DIR" -maxdepth 1 -type f \
  -name '[0-9][0-9]-*.md' \
  -exec basename {} \; \
  | cut -d- -f1 \
  | sort \
  | uniq -d
```

Expected output:

```text
<no output>
```

Any result must be investigated.

---

## Placeholder Validation

A final review should search for unresolved markers such as:

```text
TODO
TBD
FIXME
PLACEHOLDER
```

Matches must be reviewed individually.

Some may appear legitimately in examples.

Unresolved framework placeholders must be removed before release.

---

## Framework Acceptance

The Observability Framework may be accepted when:

```text
structure_validation == PASS
content_validation == PASS
architecture_validation == PASS
privacy_validation == PASS
security_validation == PASS
integration_validation == PASS
operational_validation in [PASS, PASS_WITH_FINDINGS]
blocking_findings == 0
```

Acceptance establishes framework readiness.

---

## Release Preparation

Once validation succeeds, the framework may enter release preparation.

Release preparation should verify:

* framework version;
* metadata synchronization;
* manifest synchronization;
* changelog state;
* validation state;
* revision history;
* repository cleanliness.

Release preparation must correspond to the exact validated repository state.

---

## Versioning

The Observability Framework must have an explicit framework version.

The version should remain consistent across applicable control artifacts.

Relevant files may include:

```text
EPIC.yaml
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
README.md
```

Version drift must be resolved before publication.

---

## Release Commit

The final framework release should correspond to a clearly identifiable commit.

A conceptual commit message may be:

```text
docs(observability): complete Observability Framework
```

The exact convention should follow FamilyOS repository standards.

---

## Pre-Release Git Verification

Before final commit or tagging:

```bash
git status --short
```

must be reviewed.

Only intended framework changes should remain.

Unexpected modifications must be investigated.

---

## Post-Commit Verification

After committing:

```bash
git status
git log --oneline --decorate -3
```

The expected working-tree state is:

```text
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

before final tag publication.

---

## Release Tag

The official framework baseline should be represented by an annotated immutable tag.

Conceptually:

```bash
git tag -a <observability-framework-tag> \
  -m "Observability Framework completed"
```

The exact tag follows the active FamilyOS versioning strategy.

---

## Tag Verification

Before publication:

```bash
git show --stat <observability-framework-tag>
```

should confirm that the tag points to the intended framework commit.

A release tag must never be created blindly.

---

## Publication

The release commit and tag should be published to the canonical remote.

Conceptually:

```bash
git push origin <branch>
git push origin <observability-framework-tag>
```

Publication should occur only after final validation succeeds.

---

## Remote Verification

After publication, verify:

* release commit exists remotely;
* release tag exists remotely;
* tag points to the correct commit;
* local and remote states agree.

Release completion requires verified publication, not merely a successful local tag.

---

## Tag Immutability

Once published, an official framework tag must not be silently reassigned.

If a material correction is required:

```text
Released Framework
      |
      v
Corrective Change
      |
      v
New Version
      |
      v
New Tag
```

This preserves historical integrity.

---

## Framework Release Evidence

The minimal release evidence chain is:

```text
Framework
   |
   v
Validation PASS
   |
   v
Final Commit
   |
   v
Annotated Tag
   |
   v
Remote Publication
```

This establishes a traceable framework baseline.

---

## Post-Release Verification

After publication, verify:

```text
[ ] Working tree remains clean
[ ] Release commit is reachable
[ ] Release tag exists locally
[ ] Release tag exists remotely
[ ] Tag points to expected commit
[ ] Validation state remains PASS
[ ] Framework metadata shows final state
```

This completes framework publication.

---

## Framework Status Transition

The framework lifecycle may conceptually follow:

```text
DRAFT
  |
  v
IN_PROGRESS
  |
  v
VALIDATING
  |
  v
READY
  |
  v
RELEASED
```

The exact machine-readable states are governed by EPIC metadata.

---

## Release Failure Handling

If publication fails, the repository state must be inspected before taking corrective action.

Potential failures include:

* branch push failure;
* tag push failure;
* incorrect tag target;
* authentication failure;
* remote rejection;
* dirty working tree.

The process must avoid blindly recreating commits or tags.

---

## Partial Publication

If the commit is published but the tag is not:

```text
Commit Published
      |
      v
Tag Publication Failed
```

the release is incomplete.

The correct action is normally to fix tag publication without recreating the already-published commit.

---

## Framework Correction

Material normative corrections after release require a new framework version.

Examples include changes to:

* privacy rules;
* telemetry trust boundaries;
* plugin observability permissions;
* signal semantics;
* mandatory health behavior;
* correlation rules.

Released historical versions must remain traceable.

---

## Editorial Corrections

Editorial corrections may include:

* spelling;
* formatting;
* broken references;
* wording that does not change normative meaning.

Editorial changes should follow FamilyOS documentation versioning policy.

---

## Continuous Validation

As the framework matures, validation should increasingly become automated.

Future continuous validation may include:

* document inventory checks;
* metadata validation;
* duplicate-number checks;
* link validation;
* telemetry schema validation;
* observability interface tests;
* redaction tests;
* cardinality checks.

Continuous validation reduces framework drift.

---

## Framework Drift

Framework drift occurs when documentation and real implementation diverge.

Examples include:

* plugins bypass common telemetry interfaces;
* metric names evolve without documentation;
* release context is no longer propagated;
* alerting semantics change;
* sensitive data begins appearing in logs.

Periodic validation must detect drift.

---

## Release Integration After Framework Publication

Once released, the Observability Framework becomes the normative basis for runtime observability design.

Future implementation work should reference this framework when introducing:

* telemetry libraries;
* collectors;
* observability adapters;
* plugin telemetry APIs;
* health endpoints;
* release dashboards;
* alerting infrastructure.

Implementation must not create independent incompatible observability conventions.

---

## Required Outcomes

Implementation of this validation and release model must ensure that:

* the Observability Framework is structurally complete;
* telemetry semantics are internally consistent;
* logging, metrics, and tracing are validated together;
* signal correlation is demonstrably possible;
* privacy and security requirements are explicit;
* telemetry failure behavior is bounded;
* plugin observability follows platform architecture;
* release integration is validated;
* representative operational scenarios are supported;
* blocking findings prevent framework release;
* the final framework state is versioned and traceable;
* published tags remain immutable;
* future normative changes trigger appropriate revalidation.

---

## Final Validation Principle

Observability governs how FamilyOS understands its runtime behavior.

That capability cannot be based on loosely connected documentation or unverified assumptions.

The final validation principle is:

> The FamilyOS Observability Framework is ready only when its architecture, signal model, correlation rules, privacy protections, security boundaries, operational scenarios, and framework integrations can be validated as one coherent engineering system.

---

## Final Release Principle

The framework must also apply the same engineering discipline that it expects from the platform.

The final release principle is:

> The Observability Framework becomes official only when one validated repository state is intentionally accepted, versioned, committed, tagged, published, and established as the normative baseline for future FamilyOS observability implementation.

`09-Validation-and-Release.md` therefore closes the Observability Framework by connecting architectural validation with controlled framework publication.
