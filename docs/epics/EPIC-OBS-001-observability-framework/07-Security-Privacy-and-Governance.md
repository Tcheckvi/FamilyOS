# Security, Privacy, and Governance

## EPIC-OBS-001

### Security, Privacy, and Governance

### Overview

This document defines the security, privacy, and governance requirements for observability across FamilyOS.

Observability exists to make runtime behavior understandable.

It must not become a secondary channel through which private family information, credentials, secrets, or protected system information can escape.

FamilyOS therefore treats observability data as governed engineering data.

The central rule is:

> Observe system behavior without unnecessarily observing family content.

---

## Objectives

The observability security, privacy, and governance model must:

* protect family information;
* prevent secret leakage;
* minimize telemetry data;
* control diagnostic exposure;
* govern access to observability information;
* define retention expectations;
* preserve operational evidence integrity;
* establish plugin requirements;
* support compliance validation;
* maintain clear ownership and accountability.

---

## Security by Design

Security controls SHOULD exist before observability signals are emitted.

The preferred model is:

```text
Runtime Data
     │
     ▼
Observability Instrumentation
     │
     ▼
Security / Privacy Filtering
     │
     ▼
Approved Signal
     │
     ▼
Observability Pipeline
```

Sensitive information should not rely exclusively on downstream cleanup.

The safest sensitive telemetry is telemetry that was never emitted.

---

## Privacy by Design

FamilyOS may process highly personal family information.

Observability must therefore follow privacy-by-design principles.

Instrumentation SHOULD describe:

* operations;
* state transitions;
* outcomes;
* durations;
* failure categories;
* component behavior.

Instrumentation SHOULD avoid recording the underlying personal content involved in those operations.

---

## Content Versus Behavior

FamilyOS distinguishes between observing an operation and observing its content.

Preferred:

```text
event_name = "familyos.document.created"
document_type = "family_record"
outcome = "success"
```

Avoid:

```text
document_content = "<private family information>"
```

The first describes system behavior.

The second unnecessarily exposes domain content.

---

## Data Minimization

Every observability field SHOULD have a clear operational purpose.

Before adding telemetry data, engineers should ask:

```text
Why is this field required?

Who consumes it?

Can the same operational question
be answered with less information?
```

If the information is not necessary for observability, it SHOULD NOT be emitted.

---

## Prohibited Telemetry

The following information MUST NOT intentionally appear in normal observability signals:

* passwords;
* authentication tokens;
* API secrets;
* encryption keys;
* private cryptographic material;
* session secrets;
* raw credentials;
* security recovery secrets.

Equivalent sensitive material is subject to the same prohibition regardless of its technical representation.

---

## Private Family Content

Private family content SHOULD NOT normally appear in:

* logs;
* traces;
* metric labels;
* health responses;
* alerts;
* diagnostic records.

Where exceptional diagnostic requirements exist, explicit security and privacy controls must be defined before such information is exposed.

---

## Personal Identifiers

Direct personal identifiers SHOULD be excluded when they are not operationally necessary.

Observability SHOULD prefer:

```text
opaque identifier
scoped identifier
pseudonymous identifier
aggregate value
```

over direct identity information.

Identifiers themselves must be treated according to their sensitivity.

---

## Metric Privacy

Metrics are particularly sensitive to accidental information exposure through dimensions.

Metric labels MUST remain controlled.

Avoid dimensions such as:

```text
person_name
email_address
document_id
correlation_id
raw_error_message
```

Prefer bounded operational dimensions such as:

```text
component
capability
operation
outcome
failure_category
```

This protects privacy while also preventing uncontrolled metric cardinality.

---

## Trace Privacy

Trace spans SHOULD describe execution behavior without capturing arbitrary operation payloads.

Trace attributes may include:

```text
component
operation
plugin
capability
dependency
outcome
```

Request bodies, document contents, messages, and equivalent domain payloads SHOULD NOT be captured by default.

---

## Logging Privacy

Structured logging makes privacy controls easier because sensitive fields can be identified and filtered explicitly.

FamilyOS SHOULD prefer:

```text
logger.event(
    event_name,
    approved_context,
)
```

over unrestricted interpolation of arbitrary runtime objects.

Instrumentation SHOULD NOT automatically serialize domain objects into log records.

---

## Exception Safety

Exceptions may contain sensitive information in their messages.

FamilyOS MUST therefore avoid assuming that every exception string is safe telemetry.

Structured failure information SHOULD prefer stable classifications such as:

```text
failure_category = "dependency_unavailable"
```

rather than exposing arbitrary exception content to all telemetry consumers.

Detailed exception information may remain available in appropriately controlled development or diagnostic contexts.

---

## Diagnostic Security

Diagnostics can expose deeper internal state than standard telemetry.

Diagnostic access therefore requires stronger governance.

Diagnostic capabilities SHOULD:

* expose the minimum necessary state;
* distinguish basic and detailed information where useful;
* apply authorization when appropriate;
* filter sensitive values;
* record security-relevant access where required.

Diagnostic mechanisms MUST NOT become unrestricted internal-state export interfaces.

---

## Redaction

FamilyOS MAY apply redaction when sensitive values could appear in otherwise useful telemetry.

Conceptually:

```text
Input
  │
  ▼
Sensitive Field Detection
  │
  ▼
Redaction
  │
  ▼
Approved Telemetry
```

Example:

```text
token = "[REDACTED]"
```

However, redaction is a secondary defense.

Avoiding sensitive-data emission entirely remains preferable.

---

## Filtering

Telemetry filtering MAY occur at multiple levels:

```text
Instrumentation
      ↓
Signal Validation
      ↓
Collector Filtering
      ↓
Exporter Filtering
```

Earlier filtering is preferred because it reduces the number of systems that ever receive sensitive information.

---

## Access Control

Persisted observability data SHOULD be accessible only to authorized actors and systems.

Access may depend on:

* role;
* environment;
* signal type;
* sensitivity;
* diagnostic level;
* operational responsibility.

Production observability access SHOULD NOT automatically imply access to all FamilyOS family data.

---

## Least Privilege

Observability access SHOULD follow least-privilege principles.

A consumer should receive only the telemetry required for its responsibility.

For example:

```text
Health Monitor
      │
      └── health states

Metrics Analyzer
      │
      └── aggregated metrics

Diagnostic Operator
      │
      └── controlled diagnostic context
```

Different observability consumers do not necessarily require identical access.

---

## Environment Separation

Development, testing, staging, and production observability SHOULD remain logically distinguishable.

Conceptually:

```text
Development Telemetry
Testing Telemetry
Staging Telemetry
Production Telemetry
```

Signals from one environment SHOULD NOT accidentally be interpreted as evidence from another.

Environment identity may therefore be part of observability metadata where required.

---

## Production Restrictions

Production observability SHOULD apply stronger controls than local development.

Practices acceptable during local debugging may be inappropriate in production.

Production configurations SHOULD normally:

* reduce debug verbosity;
* disable unsafe diagnostic output;
* enforce filtering;
* enforce access control;
* apply retention policies;
* protect exported telemetry.

---

## Observability Data in Tests

Tests MUST NOT require real family information to validate observability behavior.

Fixtures SHOULD use synthetic or intentionally non-sensitive data.

Tests SHOULD explicitly verify that protected values do not appear in captured signals.

---

## Data Retention

Persisted observability information SHOULD have defined retention.

Retention decisions should consider:

* operational investigation needs;
* security requirements;
* privacy requirements;
* compliance requirements;
* storage cost;
* evidence value.

The default should not be indefinite retention.

---

## Retention Categories

Different signal types MAY require different retention periods.

Conceptually:

```text
Debug Logs          → short
Operational Logs    → bounded
Metrics             → aggregated / bounded
Traces              → sampled / bounded
Security Evidence   → policy-defined
Diagnostics         → minimal / controlled
```

Exact durations belong to deployment and operational policy rather than this architecture document.

---

## Deletion

When observability information reaches the end of its approved retention period, it SHOULD be deleted.

Deletion policies must account for relevant:

* primary storage;
* replicas;
* exports;
* derived datasets.

Where external providers are used, their retention behavior must be understood and governed.

---

## Data Location

Future telemetry storage may introduce data-location or jurisdiction requirements.

FamilyOS architecture must therefore avoid assuming that observability data can always be exported to arbitrary external services.

External observability integrations SHOULD remain configurable and replaceable.

---

## Transmission Security

Observability information transmitted between components or to external systems SHOULD use appropriate transport protection.

Security requirements should reflect:

* signal sensitivity;
* deployment environment;
* trust boundary;
* destination.

Telemetry is not automatically public merely because it is operational data.

---

## Storage Security

Persisted observability information SHOULD receive appropriate protection at rest.

Controls may include:

* access restrictions;
* encryption;
* integrity protection;
* retention enforcement;
* auditability.

Implementation strength should remain proportional to data classification and operational risk.

---

## Evidence Integrity

Observability may become evidence for:

* incident investigation;
* security analysis;
* release verification;
* compliance;
* operational diagnosis.

Where evidence integrity matters, FamilyOS SHOULD provide mechanisms that make unnoticed modification appropriately difficult.

Not every debug log requires cryptographic evidence guarantees.

Controls should remain proportional.

---

## Observability Governance

Observability requires governance because uncontrolled instrumentation creates technical, operational, privacy, and security debt.

Governance establishes:

```text
Standards
   ↓
Implementation
   ↓
Validation
   ↓
Evidence
   ↓
Review
   ↓
Improvement
```

---

## Governance Responsibilities

Observability governance includes responsibility for:

* signal conventions;
* schema consistency;
* privacy rules;
* security controls;
* metric cardinality;
* correlation standards;
* health semantics;
* diagnostic boundaries;
* alert quality;
* lifecycle rules.

These responsibilities belong to the FamilyOS engineering architecture rather than individual telemetry vendors.

---

## Signal Ownership

Important observability signals SHOULD have an identifiable architectural owner.

Ownership means responsibility for:

* semantic meaning;
* compatibility;
* security;
* usefulness;
* lifecycle.

Signals without ownership tend to become inconsistent or obsolete.

---

## Schema Governance

Structured observability contracts SHOULD evolve deliberately.

Changes should distinguish:

```text
additive
compatible
deprecated
breaking
```

Breaking changes to stable observability contracts SHOULD be explicit.

Silent semantic redefinition is prohibited.

---

## Metric Governance

Metrics require particular governance because poorly designed metrics can create large operational costs.

Metric review SHOULD consider:

* purpose;
* naming;
* units;
* dimensions;
* cardinality;
* privacy;
* expected volume.

Unbounded dimensions SHOULD be rejected.

---

## Logging Governance

Logging review SHOULD consider:

* operational value;
* severity;
* structure;
* duplication;
* sensitive data;
* expected frequency.

Repeated high-volume logs with little diagnostic value SHOULD be removed or reduced.

---

## Trace Governance

Tracing review SHOULD consider:

* span boundaries;
* sampling;
* attribute safety;
* execution value;
* performance overhead.

Tracing SHOULD describe architecture, not every implementation detail.

---

## Alert Governance

Alerts require explicit quality expectations.

An alert SHOULD:

* represent a meaningful condition;
* have a clear severity;
* avoid unnecessary duplication;
* support recovery;
* be actionable.

Persistent non-actionable alerts SHOULD be treated as observability defects.

---

## Plugin Governance

Plugins participating in FamilyOS observability MUST respect platform rules.

Plugins MUST NOT:

* emit secrets;
* expose unrestricted family content;
* introduce uncontrolled metric dimensions;
* bypass correlation conventions;
* redefine platform health semantics;
* directly force a vendor dependency into FamilyOS core architecture.

---

## Plugin Compliance

The Plugin Compliance Framework MAY validate observability requirements.

Potential compliance checks include:

```text
structured event conventions
safe logging
metric cardinality
correlation support
health semantics
diagnostic safety
vendor neutrality
```

Compliance requirements SHOULD remain proportional to plugin capabilities.

---

## Third-Party Plugins

Third-party plugins represent a stronger trust boundary.

FamilyOS SHOULD assume that plugin telemetry requires validation before entering shared observability pipelines.

Possible controls include:

* schema validation;
* metadata validation;
* size limits;
* filtering;
* rate limits;
* prohibited-field detection.

The implementation may introduce these controls incrementally.

---

## Telemetry Volume Governance

Excessive telemetry creates cost and reduces signal quality.

FamilyOS SHOULD monitor or constrain:

* event frequency;
* log volume;
* trace volume;
* metric cardinality;
* diagnostic payload size.

Observability must remain proportional to operational value.

---

## Failure Governance

Observability failures SHOULD be classified according to impact.

Examples:

```text
telemetry export unavailable
      → degraded observability

correlation lost
      → diagnostic degradation

security audit evidence unavailable
      → potentially critical
```

Not all observability failures have the same severity.

---

## Configuration Governance

Configuration may control:

* log levels;
* enabled exporters;
* sampling;
* diagnostics;
* retention;
* alert thresholds.

Configuration MUST NOT permit prohibited telemetry such as secrets simply by changing verbosity.

Security invariants remain mandatory regardless of configuration.

---

## Validation

Security and privacy validation SHOULD verify:

* prohibited values are absent;
* sensitive fields are filtered;
* metric dimensions are bounded;
* correlation identifiers are opaque;
* diagnostics respect exposure rules;
* plugins follow telemetry contracts;
* configuration cannot bypass mandatory protections.

These validations SHOULD be automated where practical.

---

## Security Testing

Tests SHOULD include deliberate sensitive values and confirm that they do not escape into observability signals.

Conceptually:

```text
Sensitive Fixture
      ↓
FamilyOS Operation
      ↓
Captured Telemetry
      ↓
Security Assertion
      ↓
Sensitive Value Absent
```

This provides concrete evidence that observability controls work.

---

## Governance Review

Observability SHOULD be reviewed periodically as the platform evolves.

Review questions include:

```text
Are the signals still useful?

Are we collecting unnecessary data?

Are metrics bounded?

Are alerts actionable?

Are privacy controls working?

Have new trust boundaries appeared?

Can instrumentation be simplified?
```

The objective is continuous reduction of unnecessary complexity and risk.

---

## Minimal Initial Governance

EPIC-OBS-001 does not require a large governance bureaucracy.

The initial model can remain:

```text
Common Contracts
       +
Security Rules
       +
Privacy Rules
       +
Automated Tests
       +
Code Review
```

Additional governance mechanisms should be introduced only when justified.

---

## Relationship With Future Security Framework

EPIC-OBS-001 defines observability-specific security requirements.

The future FamilyOS Security Framework may establish broader platform security controls.

The relationship is:

```text
Observability Security Requirements
              │
              ▼
FamilyOS Security Framework
              │
              ▼
Platform Security Governance
```

Future security architecture may strengthen these controls without changing the fundamental observability principles established here.

---

## Success Criteria

This part of the Observability Framework is successful when:

* secrets are prohibited from telemetry;
* family content is excluded by default;
* observability data is minimized;
* diagnostic access is controlled;
* metric dimensions remain privacy-safe;
* trace attributes remain safe;
* retention is intentional;
* telemetry access follows least privilege;
* plugins follow platform observability rules;
* security behavior can be tested;
* observability governance remains lightweight and enforceable.

---

## Conclusion

Observability creates operational visibility, but visibility must have boundaries.

FamilyOS therefore combines:

```text
Observability
      +
Data Minimization
      +
Security
      +
Privacy
      +
Governance
      =
Trustworthy Runtime Evidence
```

The governing principle is:

> FamilyOS must be observable enough to understand its behavior while remaining private enough to protect the families it serves.

Security and privacy are therefore not restrictions added after observability.

They are part of the observability architecture itself.
