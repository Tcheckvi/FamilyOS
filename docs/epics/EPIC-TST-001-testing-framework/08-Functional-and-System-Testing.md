# Testing Framework

## 08 Functional and System Testing

### Overview

Functional and system testing validate FamilyOS behavior at progressively broader levels of the assembled platform.

While unit testing validates isolated components and integration testing validates interactions between components, functional and system testing determine whether FamilyOS delivers the expected behavior when those components operate together.

Functional testing focuses primarily on observable capabilities and business behavior.

System testing focuses on the behavior, stability, and correctness of the assembled FamilyOS platform as a complete system.

Together, these testing levels provide confidence that architectural components do not merely function independently, but collectively deliver the platform behavior defined by FamilyOS specifications, requirements, contracts, and engineering principles.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of functional and system testing is to validate FamilyOS from the perspective of complete behaviors rather than isolated implementation units.

These testing levels provide confidence that:

* platform capabilities behave as expected;
* business workflows execute correctly;
* user-visible functionality remains valid;
* plugins cooperate correctly within the runtime;
* commands produce expected outcomes;
* configuration affects system behavior correctly;
* persistence survives complete workflows;
* events propagate through the system correctly;
* errors are handled consistently;
* complete platform assemblies remain operational.

Functional and system testing therefore form an essential validation layer between component-level testing and release confidence.

---

## Testing Level Distinction

Functional and system testing are related but serve different purposes.

The distinction must remain explicit.

### Functional Testing

Functional testing validates specific behaviors or capabilities from an external or business-oriented perspective.

The primary question is:

> Does this functionality behave according to its defined requirements?

Functional tests may exercise several internal components without validating the entire deployed platform.

---

### System Testing

System testing validates the assembled platform as a complete operational system.

The primary question is:

> Does the complete FamilyOS system behave correctly when its components operate together?

System tests therefore operate at a broader architectural scope than functional tests.

---

## Testing Progression

The relationship between major testing levels can be represented as:

```text
Unit
  │
  ▼
Integration
  │
  ▼
Functional
  │
  ▼
System
```

As the testing level increases:

* scope increases;
* realism generally increases;
* infrastructure requirements may increase;
* execution time generally increases;
* failure diagnosis may become more complex.

For this reason, higher-level tests should remain intentional and focused.

---

## Functional Testing Principles

Functional testing follows several core principles.

### Test Observable Behavior

Functional tests should validate behavior that can be observed through supported platform interfaces.

Examples include:

* application APIs;
* CLI commands;
* capabilities;
* workflows;
* plugin interfaces;
* generated artifacts.

Tests should avoid depending unnecessarily on internal implementation details.

---

### Validate Requirements

Functional tests must trace back to defined behavior.

Relevant sources may include:

* specifications;
* RFCs;
* EPIC requirements;
* capability contracts;
* plugin requirements;
* acceptance criteria;
* domain rules.

A functional test should exist because a meaningful platform behavior requires validation.

---

### Prefer Behavioral Assertions

Assertions should focus on outcomes rather than internal implementation steps.

For example, a functional test should prefer:

```python
assert result.status == "completed"
```

over asserting every private method invoked during execution.

This allows implementations to evolve without invalidating behaviorally correct tests.

---

### Preserve Determinism

Functional tests must remain reproducible.

They should avoid uncontrolled dependencies on:

* public networks;
* external services;
* current system time;
* random data;
* shared environments;
* developer-specific configuration.

Controlled environments should be used wherever possible.

---

## System Testing Principles

System testing follows additional principles due to its broader scope.

### Test the Assembled Platform

System tests should exercise a representative FamilyOS assembly.

This may include:

* runtime;
* built-in plugins;
* configuration;
* persistence;
* capability registry;
* event infrastructure;
* CLI;
* application services;
* adapters.

The purpose is to validate collaboration across the complete platform boundary.

---

### Minimize Internal Substitution

System tests should use real FamilyOS components whenever practical.

Substituting major internal components reduces system realism and may hide assembly failures.

External systems may still be replaced with controlled test equivalents.

---

### Validate Operational Behavior

System testing should verify more than successful business results.

It may also validate:

* startup;
* initialization;
* shutdown;
* lifecycle behavior;
* configuration;
* resource management;
* failure recovery;
* platform integrity.

---

## Functional Testing Scope

Functional testing may cover behaviors such as:

* creating domain entities;
* updating domain information;
* executing workflows;
* invoking capabilities;
* processing commands;
* loading plugins;
* registering contributions;
* generating artifacts;
* validating policies;
* executing rules;
* processing recipes;
* handling application errors.

The exact scope depends on the feature being validated.

---

## System Testing Scope

System tests validate broader scenarios involving the assembled platform.

Examples include:

* complete platform startup;
* built-in plugin discovery;
* plugin activation;
* capability registration;
* configuration initialization;
* repository initialization;
* command execution;
* event propagation;
* persistence;
* platform shutdown.

A representative system test might validate:

```text
Configuration
      │
      ▼
Runtime Startup
      │
      ▼
Plugin Discovery
      │
      ▼
Plugin Registration
      │
      ▼
Capability Resolution
      │
      ▼
Application Execution
      │
      ▼
Persistence / Events
      │
      ▼
Expected Result
```

This validates the platform assembly rather than an isolated interaction.

---

## Business Workflow Testing

Functional tests should validate meaningful business workflows.

A workflow may cross several application components.

For example:

```text
Request
   │
   ▼
Application Service
   │
   ▼
Domain Logic
   │
   ▼
Repository
   │
   ▼
Domain Event
   │
   ▼
Result
```

The test should focus on the business outcome.

Internal components should only be inspected when necessary to validate an explicit contract.

---

## Capability Functional Testing

Capabilities are primary functional interfaces within FamilyOS.

Functional tests should verify that capabilities:

* can be discovered;
* can be invoked;
* validate inputs;
* execute expected behavior;
* produce valid outputs;
* report failures consistently;
* respect authorization or policy requirements where applicable.

Capability tests should use the same public interfaces available to legitimate platform consumers whenever possible.

---

## Plugin Functional Testing

Official and third-party plugins contribute functionality to FamilyOS.

Functional testing should verify plugin behavior through supported platform interfaces.

Typical scenarios include:

* plugin discovery;
* activation;
* capability invocation;
* contribution usage;
* policy execution;
* rule evaluation;
* recipe execution;
* plugin-specific workflows.

Tests should avoid coupling to private plugin implementation details.

---

## CLI Functional Testing

The FamilyOS CLI represents an important user-facing interface.

Functional CLI tests may validate:

* command availability;
* argument processing;
* option behavior;
* command execution;
* output;
* error messages;
* exit codes;
* configuration effects.

Example:

```python
def test_plugin_list_command_returns_registered_plugins(cli_runner):
    result = cli_runner.invoke(["plugin", "list"])

    assert result.exit_code == 0
    assert "communication" in result.output
```

The exact command syntax depends on the implemented CLI contract.

---

## Persistence Functional Testing

Functional workflows involving persistence should validate the complete behavior rather than only repository operations.

For example:

```text
Create Entity
     │
     ▼
Application Workflow
     │
     ▼
Persist Entity
     │
     ▼
Restart / Reload
     │
     ▼
Retrieve Entity
     │
     ▼
Validate State
```

This provides stronger confidence that persistence integrates correctly with application behavior.

---

## Configuration Functional Testing

Configuration can significantly change platform behavior.

Functional tests should validate:

* defaults;
* explicit configuration;
* environment overrides;
* invalid values;
* missing required values;
* feature activation;
* plugin configuration;
* runtime configuration.

Tests should use isolated configuration sources rather than relying on developer-machine state.

---

## Event Functional Testing

Functional tests involving events should validate complete observable behavior.

For example:

```text
Command
   │
   ▼
Domain Change
   │
   ▼
Event Published
   │
   ▼
Handler Executed
   │
   ▼
Observable Outcome
```

The test should validate the outcome rather than only checking that an internal publish method was called.

---

## Error Scenario Testing

Functional and system tests must validate failure behavior as well as successful behavior.

Important scenarios include:

* invalid input;
* missing configuration;
* plugin loading failure;
* capability resolution failure;
* repository failure;
* malformed contribution;
* runtime initialization failure;
* unavailable external dependency;
* conflicting registrations;
* invalid system state.

Errors should remain:

* predictable;
* diagnosable;
* safe;
* consistent with platform contracts.

---

## Startup Testing

System tests must validate platform startup behavior.

Startup testing may verify:

1. configuration loading;
2. runtime creation;
3. infrastructure initialization;
4. plugin discovery;
5. plugin validation;
6. plugin registration;
7. capability registration;
8. service initialization;
9. readiness.

Failures during startup must produce clear diagnostics.

---

## Shutdown Testing

Platform shutdown is part of correct system behavior.

System tests should validate:

* lifecycle hooks;
* resource cleanup;
* persistence flushing;
* service termination;
* event infrastructure shutdown;
* plugin shutdown;
* temporary resource cleanup.

Shutdown should remain deterministic and safe even after partial startup failures where supported.

---

## Restart Testing

Where persistent state is involved, system tests may validate restart behavior.

A restart scenario may include:

```text
Start
  │
  ▼
Create State
  │
  ▼
Persist
  │
  ▼
Shutdown
  │
  ▼
Restart
  │
  ▼
Restore State
  │
  ▼
Validate
```

Restart testing helps identify lifecycle and persistence defects that cannot be detected through isolated component tests.

---

## System Configuration Matrix

FamilyOS may support multiple valid system configurations.

System testing should identify representative configurations rather than attempting every possible combination.

Relevant dimensions may include:

* enabled plugins;
* persistence implementations;
* configuration profiles;
* optional capabilities;
* operating environments;
* feature flags.

Critical supported configurations should receive explicit validation.

---

## External Dependencies

System tests should avoid uncontrolled reliance on production external services.

Preferred approaches include:

* sandbox environments;
* local service emulators;
* controlled test servers;
* protocol-compatible fakes;
* dedicated test accounts where explicitly required.

Live service testing should be classified separately and must not destabilize the default system test suite.

---

## Test Data

Functional and system tests should use representative but controlled test data.

Test data should be:

* deterministic;
* understandable;
* minimal;
* non-sensitive;
* reproducible;
* isolated.

Production personal data must not be copied into normal test environments.

Synthetic data should be preferred.

---

## Fixtures and Environment Provisioning

Higher-level testing frequently requires more complex fixtures.

Fixtures may provide:

* temporary application directories;
* configuration trees;
* databases;
* runtime instances;
* registered plugins;
* capability registries;
* event infrastructure;
* seeded domain data;
* CLI environments.

Environment setup and teardown should be automated.

Manual environment preparation should not be required for normal automated test execution.

---

## Functional Test Isolation

Functional tests must remain independent.

Each test should establish its own required state.

Tests must not depend on:

* execution order;
* artifacts from previous tests;
* shared mutable registries;
* shared database state;
* previous runtime instances.

Isolation prevents cascading failures and improves parallel execution.

---

## System Test Isolation

System tests may require larger environments but should still preserve isolation.

Possible strategies include:

* temporary system roots;
* isolated databases;
* unique runtime instances;
* disposable configuration;
* unique identifiers;
* controlled filesystem locations.

System test environments should be disposable whenever practical.

---

## Directory Organization

Functional and system tests should remain clearly separated.

A canonical structure is:

```text
tests/
├── unit/
├── integration/
├── functional/
├── system/
├── contract/
└── regression/
```

Functional tests may be organized by platform capability or domain:

```text
tests/functional/
├── cli/
├── plugins/
├── capabilities/
├── workflows/
├── configuration/
└── events/
```

System tests may be organized by platform-level scenario:

```text
tests/system/
├── startup/
├── lifecycle/
├── plugins/
├── persistence/
├── runtime/
└── workflows/
```

The exact structure may evolve, but classification must remain explicit.

---

## Naming Conventions

Functional test names should describe expected observable behavior.

Examples:

```text
test_create_family_member_persists_member
test_plugin_command_lists_available_plugins
test_capability_invocation_returns_expected_result
test_invalid_configuration_reports_validation_error
```

System test names should describe complete platform scenarios.

Examples:

```text
test_platform_starts_with_builtin_plugins
test_platform_restart_restores_persisted_state
test_runtime_shutdown_releases_resources
test_invalid_plugin_prevents_activation
```

Names should communicate behavior rather than implementation mechanics.

---

## Test Markers

Functional and system tests may use explicit markers.

For example:

```python
@pytest.mark.functional
def test_capability_executes_expected_workflow():
    ...
```

and:

```python
@pytest.mark.system
def test_platform_starts_with_builtin_plugins():
    ...
```

This allows selective execution.

Examples:

```bash
pytest tests/functional
```

```bash
pytest tests/system
```

or:

```bash
pytest -m functional
pytest -m system
```

The exact commands are governed by the project testing configuration.

---

## Execution Strategy

Functional tests should generally execute after unit and integration validation.

A typical progression is:

```text
Static Validation
       │
       ▼
Unit Tests
       │
       ▼
Integration Tests
       │
       ▼
Functional Tests
       │
       ▼
System Tests
```

This ordering provides faster feedback by detecting simpler failures before expensive higher-level tests execute.

---

## Continuous Integration

Functional and system tests are part of the FamilyOS CI strategy.

Depending on execution cost, they may run:

* on pull requests;
* after successful unit and integration stages;
* on protected branches;
* during release preparation;
* during plugin certification;
* in scheduled validation pipelines.

Critical functional and system failures should block release promotion.

---

## Performance Considerations

Higher-level tests are inherently more expensive.

Their performance should therefore be actively managed.

Common causes of unnecessary test latency include:

* repeated platform initialization;
* unnecessary database creation;
* oversized fixtures;
* uncontrolled filesystem operations;
* external network access;
* redundant scenarios;
* excessive process creation.

Optimization should focus on infrastructure reuse where isolation can still be guaranteed.

---

## Parallel Execution

Functional and system tests should support parallel execution where architecture and infrastructure permit it.

Parallelization requires:

* isolated state;
* unique temporary resources;
* independent ports where networking is involved;
* independent databases;
* no shared mutable global configuration.

Tests that cannot safely execute in parallel should be explicitly identified.

---

## Failure Diagnostics

Higher-level test failures must provide sufficient context for diagnosis.

Useful diagnostics may include:

* scenario name;
* runtime configuration;
* enabled plugins;
* lifecycle state;
* command output;
* exit code;
* event traces;
* relevant logs;
* persistence state;
* failure category.

Diagnostic artifacts should be retained by CI when they materially help failure investigation.

Sensitive data and secrets must never be exposed.

---

## Logging During Tests

System tests may capture platform logs.

Logs should support diagnosis without becoming the primary assertion mechanism.

Tests should prefer explicit behavioral assertions over searching arbitrary log messages.

Log assertions are appropriate only when logging behavior itself is part of the contract.

---

## Functional Testing Anti-Patterns

The following practices should be avoided.

### Testing Private Implementation Details

Functional tests should validate public behavior.

---

### Reproducing Unit Tests

Higher-level tests should not duplicate every low-level edge case.

---

### Excessive Mocking

Mocking internal platform components can remove the behavior that functional testing is intended to validate.

---

### Shared State

Tests must not depend on state created by other scenarios.

---

### Uncontrolled External Services

Network dependencies introduce instability and unpredictability.

---

## System Testing Anti-Patterns

System testing must also avoid several common problems.

### One Giant System Test

A single scenario attempting to validate the entire platform becomes difficult to diagnose and maintain.

System behavior should be decomposed into meaningful scenarios.

---

### Treating System Tests as the Primary Test Layer

System tests cannot replace unit and integration testing.

Doing so creates slow feedback and poor failure localization.

---

### Environment-Specific Assumptions

Tests must not silently depend on a specific developer machine.

---

### Arbitrary Sleeps

Fixed waits should not be used to synchronize asynchronous behavior.

---

### Production Dependencies

Normal automated system tests should not require production services or production data.

---

## Relationship With Acceptance Criteria

Functional tests frequently provide executable evidence that acceptance criteria are satisfied.

Where an EPIC, RFC, specification, or feature defines explicit acceptance criteria, corresponding functional tests should be identifiable.

Traceability may be maintained through:

* test names;
* test metadata;
* documentation references;
* specification identifiers;
* validation manifests.

The mechanism should remain lightweight and maintainable.

---

## Relationship With Contract Testing

Functional testing validates behavior.

Contract testing validates compatibility expectations between providers and consumers.

A functional workflow may succeed today while a contract incompatibility remains hidden for another consumer.

Contract testing therefore complements functional testing rather than replacing it.

---

## Relationship With Regression Testing

Functional and system tests become regression protection when they preserve previously validated behavior.

When a production or system-level defect is discovered, a regression test should be introduced at the lowest appropriate testing level capable of reliably reproducing the defect.

Not every system defect requires a new system test.

If the defect can be protected through a faster unit or integration test, that level should generally be preferred.

---

## Relationship With Release Validation

System testing is an important component of release confidence.

Release validation may require system scenarios covering:

* platform startup;
* built-in plugin loading;
* critical capabilities;
* persistence;
* configuration;
* CLI availability;
* lifecycle management;
* upgrade compatibility where applicable.

A release candidate should not be promoted when mandatory system scenarios fail.

---

## Official Plugin Validation

Official FamilyOS plugins require functional validation appropriate to their domain.

Tests should demonstrate that each plugin:

* loads correctly;
* exposes declared capabilities;
* registers declared contributions;
* executes primary workflows;
* handles invalid input;
* respects platform contracts;
* integrates with the runtime;
* shuts down safely where lifecycle behavior exists.

These tests contribute to official plugin certification.

---

## Security Considerations

Functional and system tests must respect security requirements.

Tests must not:

* expose credentials;
* use production secrets;
* persist sensitive personal information unnecessarily;
* weaken security controls merely to simplify testing;
* depend on unsafe production access.

Dedicated test credentials or controlled security contexts should be used when authentication or authorization testing is required.

---

## Reliability Requirements

Functional and system tests must be treated as production engineering assets.

They must remain:

* deterministic;
* maintainable;
* reproducible;
* isolated;
* diagnosable;
* appropriately scoped.

Flaky higher-level tests are especially damaging because they weaken confidence in release validation.

Repeated nondeterministic failures must therefore be investigated rather than ignored.

---

## Quality Gates

Mandatory functional and system scenarios may participate in FamilyOS quality gates.

Possible gates include:

* pull request validation;
* protected branch validation;
* official plugin certification;
* release candidate validation;
* release approval.

The exact mandatory test sets are defined by the Quality Framework and release governance.

---

## Governance

Functional and system testing practices are governed by the FamilyOS Testing Framework.

Changes affecting:

* test classification;
* mandatory system scenarios;
* environment requirements;
* quality gates;
* platform certification;
* release validation

must remain consistent with the broader FamilyOS engineering architecture.

Relevant governance sources include:

* Engineering Foundation;
* Testing Framework;
* Quality Framework;
* Build Framework;
* Release Framework;
* Plugin Architecture;
* Runtime Architecture;
* applicable ADRs;
* applicable RFCs.

---

## Evolution Strategy

Functional and system testing will evolve as FamilyOS grows.

Future improvements may include:

* standardized application test harnesses;
* disposable runtime environments;
* automated environment provisioning;
* containerized system testing;
* scenario libraries;
* richer lifecycle validation;
* compatibility matrices;
* multi-plugin system scenarios;
* upgrade testing;
* performance-aware system suites;
* distributed runtime testing;
* release certification automation.

Evolution must preserve test determinism, maintainability, architectural clarity, and useful feedback.

---

## Validation Checklist

* [ ] configuration behavior is validated;
* [ ] CI can execute the required suites;

* [ ] critical scenarios participate in applicable quality gates;
* [ ] release validation includes appropriate system coverage.

---

## Final Principle

Functional and system testing provide evidence that FamilyOS delivers correct behavior beyond isolated components and individual integrations.

The fundamental rule is:

> A platform is not validated merely because its components pass independently; it is validated when meaningful functionality and representative system assemblies behave correctly under controlled, reproducible conditions.

By maintaining focused functional tests and representative system tests, FamilyOS can evolve its domains, plugins, runtime, infrastructure, and user-facing capabilities while preserving confidence in the behavior of the platform as a whole.
