# Testing Framework

## 13 Test Isolation and Determinism

### Overview

Test isolation and determinism are foundational properties of the FamilyOS Testing Framework.

A test is isolated when its result does not depend on the execution, state, order, environment, or side effects of another test.

A test is deterministic when the same validated conditions consistently produce the same observable result.

Without isolation and determinism, automated test results cannot be treated as reliable engineering evidence.

Non-isolated or nondeterministic tests can create:

* intermittent failures;
* false positives;
* false negatives;
* order-dependent behavior;
* environment-specific failures;
* unreliable CI pipelines;
* difficult defect diagnosis;
* reduced confidence in release validation.

FamilyOS therefore treats test isolation and determinism as mandatory quality properties rather than optional testing conveniences.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this strategy is to establish the rules and engineering practices required to ensure that FamilyOS tests produce reliable, reproducible, and independently executable results.

The strategy ensures that:

* tests can execute independently;
* test execution order does not influence results;
* shared mutable state is controlled;
* external dependencies do not introduce unpredictability;
* time-based behavior is reproducible;
* random behavior can be reproduced;
* filesystem state is isolated;
* persistent data is isolated;
* environment configuration is controlled;
* parallel execution remains safe;
* CI and local execution produce equivalent behavior.

Reliable tests allow engineering decisions to be based on evidence rather than probability.

---

## Core Principle

The fundamental principle is:

> A test result is trustworthy only when the behavior it validates depends exclusively on explicitly controlled test conditions.

A test should not succeed because another test happened to run before it.

A test should not fail because:

* the clock changed;
* another process used a resource;
* a previous test left state behind;
* the network was unavailable;
* the developer had a different environment variable;
* random input changed unexpectedly.

All meaningful dependencies should be explicit and controlled.

---

## Isolation Definition

A test is isolated when it owns or safely controls all mutable state required for its execution.

Conceptually:

```text
Test A
  │
  ├── Own State
  ├── Own Fixtures
  └── Own Resources

Test B
  │
  ├── Own State
  ├── Own Fixtures
  └── Own Resources
```

Neither test should depend on state produced by the other.

---

## Determinism Definition

A deterministic test satisfies:

```text
Same Inputs
    +
Same Controlled Environment
    +
Same Defined State
    =
Same Result
```

Repeated executions should therefore produce equivalent outcomes.

This does not require every internal implementation event to occur identically.

It requires the tested behavior to remain reproducible according to its contract.

---

## Isolation Dimensions

Test isolation applies across several dimensions.

These include:

* process state;
* memory state;
* filesystem state;
* database state;
* environment variables;
* configuration;
* time;
* randomness;
* network resources;
* runtime registries;
* plugin registries;
* event subscriptions;
* caches;
* external services.

Each dimension must be controlled according to the test scope.

---

## Independent Execution

Every automated test should be executable independently.

For example:

```bash
pytest tests/unit/test_family.py::test_family_creation
```

should succeed without requiring another test to execute first.

This property is essential for:

* debugging;
* selective test execution;
* CI test distribution;
* parallel execution;
* regression reproduction.

---

## Order Independence

Tests must not depend on execution order.

The following is invalid:

```text
Test 1 creates state
        │
        ▼
Test 2 assumes that state exists
```

Instead:

```text
Test 1 creates its own state

Test 2 creates its own state
```

Changing test order should not change outcomes.

---

## Randomized Test Order

Randomized test ordering can be useful for detecting hidden dependencies.

A suite that succeeds only under a fixed order is not considered isolated.

Future FamilyOS testing tooling may periodically execute tests in randomized order to detect order coupling.

---

## Shared Mutable State

Shared mutable state is one of the primary causes of test interference.

Examples include:

* global dictionaries;
* module-level registries;
* singleton services;
* persistent caches;
* shared database rows;
* mutable session fixtures.

Shared mutable state should be avoided or explicitly reset between tests.

---

## Global State

Production global state can make tests difficult to isolate.

Examples include:

```python
PLUGIN_REGISTRY = {}
```

or:

```python
CURRENT_RUNTIME = None
```

Where possible, FamilyOS should prefer explicit runtime-owned state.

If global state exists, tests must establish and restore its state safely.

---

## Singleton Isolation

Singleton components can introduce hidden dependencies between tests.

Tests using singleton services should ensure:

* fresh instance creation where possible;
* explicit reset mechanisms where architecturally justified;
* no retained mutable state between scenarios.

A singleton should never become a reason for order-dependent tests.

---

## Registry Isolation

FamilyOS uses architectural registries for concepts such as:

* plugins;
* capabilities;
* services;
* contributions.

Tests should not share mutable registry instances unless the registry is intentionally immutable.

Preferred:

```python
registry = CapabilityRegistry()
```

for each test or fixture scope.

Avoid reliance on a process-wide registry during normal unit or integration tests.

---

## Plugin Registry Isolation

Plugin tests should create isolated plugin registries.

A test that registers:

```text
communication
finance
security
```

must not affect another test expecting an empty registry.

Registry cleanup must be automatic.

---

## Capability Registry Isolation

Capability registration tests require particular care because duplicate or stale registration can cause misleading failures.

Each test should begin from a known registry state.

Examples include:

```text
Empty Registry
```

or explicitly constructed:

```text
Registry
├── capability-a
└── capability-b
```

The initial state must be obvious from the fixture.

---

## Event Handler Isolation

Event subscribers must not leak between tests.

Potential failure:

```text
Test A registers handler
Test A ends
Test B publishes event
Handler from Test A is still active
```

This can produce duplicate handling or unexpected side effects.

Event infrastructure must provide isolated instances or reliable teardown.

---

## Cache Isolation

Caches can create hidden coupling.

A test may pass because data was cached during an earlier test.

Tests involving caches should establish explicitly whether the cache begins:

* empty;
* preloaded;
* expired;
* disabled.

Cache state should never depend implicitly on previous tests.

---

## Filesystem Isolation

Filesystem tests should use dedicated temporary locations.

Avoid writing test files into:

* repository roots;
* user home directories;
* production-like configuration paths;
* shared temporary paths with fixed names.

Preferred:

```python
def test_configuration_loader(tmp_path):
    config = tmp_path / "familyos.yaml"
```

Each test receives an isolated temporary directory.

---

## Fixed Filesystem Paths

Fixed paths create collision risk.

Avoid:

```python
Path("/tmp/familyos-test")
```

when multiple tests or CI workers may use the same path.

Prefer uniquely provisioned temporary directories.

---

## File Cleanup

Files created during tests must be removed automatically.

Cleanup must occur even when:

* assertions fail;
* exceptions occur;
* the test is interrupted;
* partial setup fails where possible.

Testing frameworks and temporary-resource abstractions should handle cleanup whenever practical.

---

## Working Directory Isolation

Tests must not assume a particular current working directory unless that behavior is explicitly under test.

A test changing the working directory must restore it afterward.

Implicit working-directory dependencies frequently cause local-versus-CI differences.

---

## Database Isolation

Database-backed tests require explicit isolation.

Possible strategies include:

* in-memory databases;
* unique temporary database files;
* transaction rollback;
* isolated schemas;
* disposable database instances;
* containerized test databases.

The selected strategy must preserve the realism required by the testing level.

---

## Transaction Isolation

Transaction-based cleanup may be used where supported.

Example:

```text
Begin Transaction
      │
      ▼
Execute Test
      │
      ▼
Rollback
```

This provides fast cleanup but may not be appropriate when the test itself validates transaction commit behavior.

The cleanup mechanism must not invalidate the behavior under test.

---

## Database Identifier Isolation

Parallel tests must not accidentally operate on identical persistent identifiers.

If deterministic identifiers are used, database isolation should guarantee separate namespaces or databases.

If a shared database is unavoidable, unique test-level identifiers should be used.

---

## Database Seeding Isolation

Each test should seed only the data it requires.

Large shared seed datasets create hidden dependencies and make it difficult to understand why tests succeed.

Preferred:

```text
Fresh Database
      │
      ▼
Minimal Seed
      │
      ▼
Execute Test
      │
      ▼
Discard State
```

---

## Environment Variable Isolation

Environment variables are process-global mutable state.

Tests modifying them must restore their previous state automatically.

Example:

```python
def test_mode_from_environment(monkeypatch):
    monkeypatch.setenv("FAMILYOS_MODE", "test")

    config = load_configuration()

    assert config.mode == "test"
```

The test should not depend on whether the variable existed before execution.

---

## Environment Independence

Normal tests must not depend on developer-specific environment variables.

Potential hidden dependencies include:

```text
HOME
USER
PATH
LANG
TZ
FAMILYOS_CONFIG
DATABASE_URL
```

When these affect the test, values must be explicitly controlled.

---

## Configuration Isolation

Configuration should be explicitly created for tests.

Tests should not silently load a developer's FamilyOS configuration.

Preferred sources include:

* temporary config files;
* in-memory configuration objects;
* explicit environment patches;
* test-specific configuration providers.

The initial configuration should always be known.

---

## Time Determinism

Current time is inherently variable.

Tests must not rely directly on real wall-clock time when time affects behavior.

Avoid:

```python
datetime.now()
```

inside tests where the returned value influences expectations.

Prefer injected clocks or explicit timestamps.

---

## Fixed Clocks

A fixed clock provides deterministic time.

Example:

```python
class FixedClock:
    def now(self) -> datetime:
        return datetime(
            2026,
            8,
            7,
            12,
            0,
            tzinfo=timezone.utc,
        )
```

Time-sensitive components should depend on a clock abstraction when practical.

---

## Advancing Clocks

Some tests require time progression.

A controlled advancing clock may provide:

```python
clock.advance(minutes=10)
```

This is preferable to waiting ten actual minutes or modifying system time.

---

## Sleep Avoidance

Tests should not use arbitrary sleeps to synchronize behavior.

Avoid:

```python
time.sleep(2)
```

because execution speed and scheduler behavior vary.

Prefer:

* synchronization primitives;
* controlled clocks;
* completion signals;
* polling with explicit deterministic conditions where necessary.

---

## Timeout Testing

Timeout behavior should be validated without relying on slow real-time waits where possible.

A controlled dependency can simulate:

```text
Request
  │
  ▼
Timeout Condition
  │
  ▼
Expected Error
```

Tests should remain fast and reproducible.

---

## Timezone Determinism

Timezone-sensitive tests must explicitly define timezone context.

They must not depend on the host machine's timezone.

Relevant scenarios may include:

* UTC conversions;
* local date boundaries;
* daylight-saving transitions;
* midnight boundaries.

Expected behavior should use timezone-aware values.

---

## Date Boundary Testing

Date-sensitive tests should explicitly test relevant boundaries.

Examples include:

```text
23:59:59
00:00:00
End of Month
Start of Month
End of Year
Start of Year
```

The boundary should be constructed rather than waited for.

---

## Randomness Determinism

Random behavior can make tests difficult to reproduce.

Tests should avoid randomness when deterministic values are sufficient.

Instead of:

```python
uuid4()
```

prefer:

```python
FamilyId("family-001")
```

when uniqueness is not part of the behavior.

---

## Seeded Randomness

When randomized testing is useful, a reproducible seed should be available.

Conceptually:

```text
Random Seed
    │
    ▼
Generated Inputs
    │
    ▼
Test
```

A failing random test must provide enough information to recreate the exact failure.

---

## Property-Based Testing Determinism

Property-based testing may generate many input cases.

The framework should retain or report the minimized failing example.

A discovered defect should be reproducible without depending on future random generation.

Significant discovered failures should become deterministic regression tests.

---

## Identifier Determinism

Random IDs should be injected or controlled when they appear in expected results.

Example:

```python
class FixedIdGenerator:
    def new_id(self) -> str:
        return "family-001"
```

This improves:

* assertions;
* diagnostics;
* snapshot stability;
* failure reproduction.

---

## Network Isolation

Normal automated tests should not depend on uncontrolled external networks.

External network calls introduce:

* latency;
* outages;
* DNS variability;
* authentication dependencies;
* rate limits;
* external data changes.

Tests should instead use controlled boundaries.

---

## External Service Isolation

External services may be represented through:

* stubs;
* fakes;
* local test servers;
* sandbox environments;
* service emulators.

The strategy depends on the testing level.

A unit test may use a stub client.

An integration test may use a local fake server.

A specialized certification suite may use an official sandbox.

---

## Network Access Blocking

FamilyOS may block unexpected external network access during normal automated testing.

This helps detect accidental dependencies on live services.

Any test requiring intentional network access should be explicitly classified.

---

## Port Isolation

Tests using local network servers must avoid fixed shared ports.

Parallel execution may otherwise produce collisions.

Preferred strategies include dynamically allocated free ports or isolated container networking.

---

## Process Isolation

Tests that launch subprocesses must control:

* environment;
* working directory;
* input;
* output;
* lifecycle;
* cleanup.

Child processes must not remain running after test completion.

---

## Subprocess Determinism

Commands invoked through subprocess tests should use controlled executables and arguments.

Tests should not depend on arbitrary binaries installed on a developer machine unless that dependency is an explicit toolchain requirement.

---

## Thread Isolation

Tests involving threads must ensure background threads terminate.

Leaked threads can affect subsequent tests or prevent process completion.

Tests should use explicit synchronization rather than timing assumptions.

---

## Async Isolation

Asynchronous tests must ensure:

* tasks complete or are cancelled;
* event loops do not retain unexpected state;
* async resources are closed;
* handlers do not leak.

Pending asynchronous tasks at test completion should be treated as potential test defects.

---

## Async Determinism

Async execution order may vary.

Tests should assert defined outcomes rather than incidental scheduling order unless order is contractually guaranteed.

Synchronization should use explicit events, queues, or task completion mechanisms.

---

## Event Ordering

Event ordering should only be asserted where the architecture guarantees it.

If ordering is undefined, tests should not accidentally depend on one observed ordering.

For order-independent contracts, assertions should use order-independent comparisons.

---

## Parallel Test Execution

FamilyOS tests should support parallel execution where practical.

Parallel safety requires:

* isolated mutable state;
* independent files;
* independent databases;
* unique ports;
* isolated registries;
* no mutable global fixtures.

Parallel execution is a strong test of isolation quality.

---

## Worker Isolation

When multiple test workers are used, resources should be namespaced per worker when required.

Examples include:

```text
test-db-worker-1
test-db-worker-2
test-db-worker-3
```

or separate temporary directories provisioned automatically.

---

## Parallel-Safe Identifiers

Deterministic identifiers are valuable, but they can conflict if parallel tests share infrastructure.

Isolation should ideally separate infrastructure.

Where that is not possible, test-specific namespaces should be applied.

---

## Fixture Isolation

Fixtures must preserve the isolation requirements of their consuming tests.

A fixture that returns mutable shared state can invalidate an otherwise well-designed test.

Function-scoped mutable fixtures should generally be preferred.

---

## Fixture Scope Review

Broad fixture scopes should be reviewed carefully.

A session-scoped fixture is appropriate for immutable resources.

It is risky for mutable state such as:

* repositories;
* registries;
* runtime instances;
* databases containing test state.

Performance improvements must not compromise test independence.

---

## Autouse Fixture Isolation

Autouse fixtures can provide global safeguards such as:

* clearing environment changes;
* disabling external network access;
* restoring global state.

They should not silently introduce scenario-specific state.

Invisible setup reduces clarity.

---

## Cleanup Guarantees

Every allocated resource must have a cleanup strategy.

Examples include:

* file handles;
* temporary files;
* directories;
* database connections;
* processes;
* sockets;
* event handlers;
* runtime instances.

Cleanup should be automatic and exception-safe.

---

## Setup Failure Cleanup

Partial fixture setup can fail before normal teardown begins.

Fixtures should be structured so already-created resources are still released where practical.

Resource lifecycle management should account for partial initialization.

---

## Context Managers

Context managers can provide deterministic resource cleanup.

Example:

```python
with create_test_runtime() as runtime:
    ...
```

The runtime should release resources on exit even when the test raises an exception.

---

## Runtime Isolation

Runtime tests should generally use fresh FamilyOS runtime instances.

A runtime may contain mutable:

* service registries;
* capability registries;
* plugin state;
* event handlers;
* configuration;
* lifecycle status.

Sharing these across unrelated tests introduces significant interference risk.

---

## Runtime Lifecycle Isolation

Each runtime-oriented test should establish an explicit lifecycle.

For example:

```text
Create
  │
  ▼
Initialize
  │
  ▼
Execute Scenario
  │
  ▼
Shutdown
```

The shutdown step must occur even if validation fails.

---

## Plugin Isolation

Plugin tests must not depend on plugins accidentally registered elsewhere in the test process.

Each test should explicitly define:

* installed plugins;
* enabled plugins;
* plugin configuration;
* dependency state.

The plugin environment should be reproducible.

---

## Contribution Isolation

Policies, rules, recipes, templates, and other plugin contributions should use isolated registries or stores.

Contributions registered during one test must not become available implicitly to another.

---

## CLI Isolation

CLI tests must isolate:

* environment;
* configuration;
* filesystem;
* current directory;
* runtime state;
* output capture.

A CLI test should behave the same whether executed individually or as part of the complete suite.

---

## Standard Input and Output Isolation

Tests interacting with:

* standard input;
* standard output;
* standard error

must use framework-provided capture or explicit streams.

They must not rely on actual interactive input.

---

## Logging Isolation

Logging configuration is often process-global.

Tests modifying logger levels, handlers, or formatters must restore them.

Log capture should use controlled test mechanisms.

A test must not fail because another test changed global logging configuration.

---

## Warning Isolation

Warning filters may also be process-global.

Tests that modify warning behavior must restore it.

Warnings expected by a scenario should be captured explicitly.

---

## Locale Isolation

Locale can affect:

* sorting;
* formatting;
* date presentation;
* decimal representation.

Tests requiring locale-specific behavior should define the locale explicitly.

Normal tests should avoid accidental dependency on host locale.

---

## Encoding Determinism

File and text tests should specify encodings where relevant.

UTF-8 should be preferred unless another encoding is part of the contract.

Tests should not rely on platform-default encoding.

---

## Platform Independence

Where behavior is intended to be platform-independent, tests must not depend on:

* Unix-only path syntax;
* Windows-only assumptions;
* filesystem ordering;
* shell-specific behavior.

Platform-specific tests should be explicitly classified.

---

## Filesystem Ordering

Filesystem enumeration order should not be assumed unless explicitly sorted.

Avoid:

```python
files = list(path.iterdir())
assert files == [...]
```

without a defined ordering contract.

Prefer explicit sorting when ordering is not meaningful.

---

## Dictionary and Set Ordering

Tests should distinguish between ordered and unordered contracts.

If order is irrelevant, assertions should compare appropriately.

A deterministic observed order should not accidentally become an unsupported contract.

---

## Floating-Point Determinism

Floating-point calculations may require tolerance-based assertions.

Example:

```python
assert result == pytest.approx(expected)
```

Exact equality should be used only when the numerical contract supports it.

---

## External Clock Dependencies

External services may return timestamps.

Tests should not assume exact values unless the external timestamp is controlled.

When necessary, the service boundary should be stubbed or sandboxed.

---

## Scheduler Determinism

Scheduled behavior should be tested through controlled scheduler abstractions.

Tests should be able to trigger scheduled operations explicitly rather than waiting for wall-clock schedules.

---

## Retry Determinism

Retry logic should avoid real delays.

A controlled dependency can produce a defined sequence:

```text
Attempt 1 → Temporary Failure
Attempt 2 → Temporary Failure
Attempt 3 → Success
```

The test can then assert:

* number of attempts;
* final result;
* error behavior.

No arbitrary sleeping is required.

---

## Backoff Testing

Backoff calculations can be tested as pure logic where possible.

If scheduler interaction is involved, an injected scheduler or clock should record requested delays without waiting.

---

## Flaky Tests

A flaky test produces inconsistent results without intentional changes to code or validated environment.

Typical causes include:

* race conditions;
* shared state;
* real-time dependencies;
* random inputs;
* external networks;
* insufficient cleanup;
* fixed ports;
* hidden ordering assumptions;
* asynchronous timing.

Flaky tests must be treated as engineering defects.

---

## Flaky Test Policy

FamilyOS should not normalize flaky tests as expected pipeline behavior.

Repeatedly rerunning a test until it passes does not establish correctness.

A flaky test should be:

1. identified;
2. investigated;
3. classified;
4. corrected;
5. validated repeatedly.

Temporary quarantine may be appropriate only under controlled governance.

---

## Test Retries

Automatic retries can hide nondeterminism.

Retries should not be used as the primary solution to flaky tests.

Where retry mechanisms exist for diagnostic purposes, the initial failure should remain visible.

---

## Quarantined Tests

A test may be temporarily quarantined when:

* it is confirmed unreliable;
* immediate repair is impossible;
* its continued execution blocks unrelated work.

Quarantine must include:

* ownership;
* reason;
* tracking;
* repair expectation.

Quarantined tests must not silently disappear from quality reporting.

---

## Repetition Testing

Potentially flaky tests may be executed repeatedly to verify stability.

For example:

```text
Run Test 100 Times
       │
       ├── 100 Pass → Increased Confidence
       └── Failure  → Investigate Nondeterminism
```

Repetition is a diagnostic technique, not a replacement for proper design.

---

## Failure Reproduction

A nondeterministic failure should be reduced to reproducible conditions.

Useful diagnostic context may include:

* random seed;
* test order;
* worker identifier;
* platform;
* Python version;
* relevant timestamps;
* fixture state.

This information helps convert flaky failures into deterministic regressions.

---

## Deterministic Failure Messages

Test failures should also provide deterministic, readable diagnostics.

Including uncontrolled random IDs, temporary paths, or timestamps can make comparison harder.

Where such values are unavoidable, diagnostics should still identify the behavioral difference clearly.

---

## Snapshot Determinism

Snapshot tests require stable output.

Values such as:

* timestamps;
* random identifiers;
* temporary directories;
* nondeterministic ordering

should be normalized or controlled before snapshot comparison.

Otherwise snapshots generate meaningless churn.

---

## Golden File Determinism

Golden-file tests require stable inputs and output generation.

The resulting artifact must not contain nondeterministic metadata unless that metadata is itself under test.

---

## Serialization Determinism

Serialized output should be deterministic when the contract requires canonical representation.

Potential concerns include:

* field ordering;
* set ordering;
* timestamps;
* generated IDs.

Tests should validate canonical behavior only where it is intentional.

---

## Test Discovery Determinism

The set of discovered tests should remain stable for a given code state and configuration.

Dynamic test generation must be deterministic.

Test discovery should not depend on external services or mutable runtime state.

---

## Collection Isolation

Test collection itself should avoid side effects.

Importing a test module should not:

* modify production state;
* start services;
* connect to databases;
* register permanent global handlers.

Setup belongs in fixtures or explicit test lifecycle code.

---

## Import-Time Side Effects

Production modules with large import-time side effects make isolation harder.

FamilyOS architecture should minimize:

* automatic registration;
* resource creation;
* network access;
* environment mutation

during import.

Explicit initialization improves testability and runtime clarity.

---

## Dependency Injection and Isolation

Dependency injection is a primary architectural mechanism supporting determinism.

Dependencies such as:

* repositories;
* clocks;
* ID generators;
* configuration;
* event publishers;
* external gateways

should be injectable where control is required.

This reduces invasive monkeypatching.

---

## Testability as an Architectural Signal

Difficulty achieving isolation may reveal architectural problems.

Examples include:

* hidden global dependencies;
* uncontrolled singletons;
* implicit I/O;
* direct wall-clock access;
* hard-coded external services.

Testing friction can therefore indicate areas requiring architectural improvement.

---

## Unit Test Isolation

Unit tests should provide the strongest isolation.

They should normally avoid:

* real network access;
* real databases;
* shared runtime state;
* uncontrolled filesystem access.

Dependencies outside the unit boundary should be replaced with appropriate test doubles.

---

## Integration Test Isolation

Integration tests contain real interactions but must still isolate the environment surrounding those interactions.

For example:

```text
Repository Adapter
       +
Temporary Database
```

may be real while unrelated external services remain substituted.

---

## Functional Test Isolation

Functional tests may assemble larger application contexts.

They should still control:

* data;
* configuration;
* external services;
* filesystem state;
* runtime instance.

Functional realism does not justify environmental nondeterminism.

---

## System Test Isolation

System tests may use representative complete environments.

Isolation may require:

* disposable system roots;
* containerized services;
* isolated databases;
* unique ports;
* dedicated configuration.

System tests should remain reproducible even when their infrastructure is larger.

---

## Contract Test Isolation

Contract tests should be especially deterministic.

Contract fixtures, schemas, and provider verification environments should remain stable.

External variability would weaken compatibility evidence.

---

## Regression Test Isolation

Regression tests must reproduce a historical failure reliably.

If a regression test remains nondeterministic, it does not provide durable protection.

The original failure condition should be reduced to deterministic inputs whenever possible.

---

## Test Data Relationship

Isolation depends strongly on test data design.

Test data should be:

* owned by the test;
* deterministic;
* minimal;
* safely cleaned;
* independent from production state.

The FamilyOS Test Data and Fixtures strategy defines these requirements in greater detail.

---

## Mock and Fake Relationship

Mocks and fakes can support isolation by replacing uncontrolled dependencies.

However, excessive substitution can invalidate test realism.

Isolation must preserve the behavior belonging to the declared testing level.

---

## Coverage Relationship

Coverage results are only reliable when test execution is stable.

Nondeterministic tests can produce varying coverage results across runs.

Isolation and determinism therefore form prerequisites for trustworthy coverage analysis.

---

## CI Determinism

CI should provide a reproducible validation environment.

Relevant environment dimensions include:

* Python version;
* dependencies;
* configuration;
* filesystem setup;
* timezone where controlled;
* test commands;
* test markers.

CI should minimize hidden differences from supported local environments.

---

## Local and CI Equivalence

Tests should not require one set of assumptions locally and another in CI.

The same logical test should validate the same behavior in both environments.

Environment-specific infrastructure should be provided through explicit configuration rather than hidden conditions.

---

## Containerized Test Environments

Containerization may improve isolation for certain integration or system tests.

Potential benefits include:

* controlled dependencies;
* disposable databases;
* fixed service versions;
* predictable networking.

Containerization is not itself a guarantee of deterministic tests.

State and timing still require careful control.

---

## Reproducible Dependencies

Tests must execute against controlled dependency versions.

Unexpected dependency drift can produce inconsistent results.

Dependency pinning and build reproducibility are governed by the FamilyOS Engineering and Build Frameworks.

---

## Hermetic Testing

A hermetic test depends only on declared inputs and controlled resources.

Conceptually:

```text
Declared Inputs
      │
      ▼
Test Environment
      │
      ▼
Result
```

No hidden external dependency participates.

FamilyOS should move critical automated tests toward hermetic behavior where practical.

---

## Hermetic Unit Tests

Unit tests should generally be highly hermetic.

They should not require:

* network;
* database services;
* production configuration;
* external credentials.

This enables extremely fast and reliable execution.

---

## Hermetic Integration Tests

Full hermeticity may require local controlled infrastructure.

For example:

```text
Application
     │
     ▼
Real Adapter
     │
     ▼
Disposable Local Database
```

The environment remains self-contained despite real integration.

---

## Resource Ownership

Every resource used during a test should have clear ownership.

Ownership determines responsibility for:

* creation;
* mutation;
* cleanup;
* lifetime.

Resources without clear ownership frequently become sources of test interference.

---

## Resource Lifetime

Resource lifetime should match the narrowest appropriate test scope.

Conceptually:

```text

Shared lifetime should require explicit justification.

## Isolation Verification

FamilyOS may use automated techniques to verify isolation.

Potential approaches include:

* randomized execution order;
* parallel execution;
* test repetition;
* external network blocking;
* leaked resource detection;
* pending async task detection;
* environment-state verification.

These techniques can expose hidden dependencies.

---

## Determinism Verification

Determinism can be evaluated by executing the same suite repeatedly under equivalent conditions.

Unexpected result variance should trigger investigation.

---

## Parallel Execution as Validation

Parallel execution is useful not only for speed but also for detecting poor isolation.

Tests that fail only in parallel may reveal:

* resource collisions;
* shared state;
* fixed ports;
* fixed file paths;
* non-thread-safe global data.

Such failures should be corrected rather than disabling parallelism automatically.

---

## Performance and Isolation

Isolation sometimes introduces setup overhead.

For example, creating a fresh database for every test may be expensive.

Optimization strategies may include:

* transaction rollback;
* immutable resource sharing;
* efficient fixture factories;
* per-worker infrastructure.

Performance optimization must preserve correctness.

---

## Isolation vs Realism

More isolation does not always mean better testing.

A unit test should isolate strongly.

A system test should preserve realistic internal collaboration.

The correct balance depends on testing level.

The rule is:

> Isolate uncontrolled state, not the behavior the test is intended to validate.

---

## Determinism vs Realism

Real systems may include nondeterministic elements.

Testing should make those elements controllable while preserving their contractual semantics.

For example, asynchronous processing can be tested with explicit synchronization rather than pretending the system is synchronous.

---

## Error Isolation

Failure tests should isolate the intended failure.

A test intended to validate repository failure should not also depend on a network service that may independently fail.

Single-cause tests produce clearer diagnostics.

---

## Failure Locality

Isolation improves failure locality.

A well-isolated test failure should point toward a narrow behavioral cause.

Cascading failures often indicate shared state or broad uncontrolled fixtures.

---

## Cascading Failures

When one failing test causes many subsequent failures, FamilyOS should investigate possible leaked state.

Examples include:

* unclosed database transactions;
* changed environment variables;
* persistent registry mutations;
* unclosed event handlers;
* modified working directory.

Cascading failures are strong isolation warning signals.

---

## Test Pollution

Test pollution occurs when one test modifies the environment in a way that affects another.

Common forms include:

* filesystem pollution;
* environment pollution;
* global state pollution;
* database pollution;
* registry pollution;
* logging pollution.

Test pollution must be treated as a defect.

---

## Pollution Detection

Potential safeguards include verifying after tests that:

* expected temporary resources were removed;
* environment changes were restored;
* global registries are clean;
* event handlers are detached;
* processes are terminated.

Automation may be introduced incrementally.

---

## Deterministic Assertions

Assertions should not depend on uncontrolled values.

For unordered collections:

```python
assert set(actual) == set(expected)
```

may be more correct than ordered comparison when order is not contractual.

For approximate numerical behavior:

```python
assert actual == pytest.approx(expected)
```

may reflect the real contract more accurately.

---

## Stable Tests Across Refactoring

A deterministic test should validate contracts and behavior rather than incidental internal sequencing.

This improves both reliability and maintainability.

---

## Isolation Anti-Patterns

The following practices should be avoided.

### Test Order Dependencies

A test must never require another test to execute first.

---

### Shared Mutable Fixtures

Mutable session-wide fixtures create hidden coupling.

---

### Fixed Temporary Paths

Parallel execution can cause collisions.

---

### Fixed Network Ports

Concurrent tests may interfere with one another.

---

### Real Wall-Clock Waiting

Timing-based sleeps create slow and unreliable tests.

---

### Uncontrolled Randomness

A failure that cannot be reproduced is difficult to fix.

---

### External Production Services

Live external systems create uncontrollable dependencies.

---

### Global Registry Leakage

Registrations must not persist unintentionally across tests.

---

### Environment Leakage

Changed environment variables must be restored.

---

### Database Pollution

Persistent state must not survive unintentionally between scenarios.

---

### Retry Until Green

Repeatedly rerunning flaky tests does not establish correctness.

---

### Ignoring Parallel Failures

Parallel-only failures often expose genuine isolation defects.

---

## Determinism Anti-Patterns

The following also undermine determinism.

### Exact Current-Time Assertions

Real-time values change between executions.

---

### Arbitrary Sleep Synchronization

Scheduler timing is not a reliable synchronization mechanism.

---

### Unseeded Random Generation

Random failures become difficult to reproduce.

---

### External Mutable Data

Public API or remote database contents may change independently.

---

### Undefined Ordering Assumptions

Collections or asynchronous operations may not guarantee order.

---

### Host-Specific Configuration

Tests must not accidentally depend on machine state.

---

## Flakiness Metrics

FamilyOS may track reliability metrics such as:

* flaky test count;
* retry frequency;
* quarantined test count;
* nondeterministic CI failures;
* order-dependent failures;
* parallel-only failures.

Metrics should drive corrective action rather than normalize instability.

---

## Flake Budget

FamilyOS should not establish a permanent acceptable flake rate for mandatory quality gates.

Mandatory validation should ultimately be reliable enough that a failure is treated as meaningful.

---

## Quality Gates

Isolation and determinism are prerequisites for trustworthy quality gates.

Tests used to block:

* pull requests;
* protected branches;
* plugin certification;
* release candidates;
* releases

must provide reliable results.

Repeated nondeterminism in mandatory tests must be addressed with priority.

---

## Release Validation

Release validation must not depend on known flaky tests without explicit governance.

A release cannot gain meaningful confidence from tests whose outcomes are unpredictable.

---

## Plugin Certification

Official plugin certification tests must be reproducible.

Certification must not depend on:

* accidental installed plugin state;
* local user configuration;
* external production services;
* shared registries;
* uncontrolled network conditions.

Certification environments should be explicitly provisioned.

---

## Security Testing Isolation

Security-related tests require controlled environments.

Tests must not depend on real credentials or production security systems.

Authorization and authentication validation should use representative controlled identities and policies.

Security logic itself must remain real when it is the behavior under test.

---

## Data Privacy

Isolation also protects privacy.

Using synthetic isolated datasets prevents accidental mixing with real FamilyOS user information.

Test environments must not read production personal data merely because it is available locally.

---

## Evidence Reliability

Test evidence is meaningful only when execution conditions are known and reproducible.

A deterministic test suite provides stronger evidence for:

* change validation;
* defect resolution;
* quality gates;
* certification;
* release decisions.

---

## Relationship With Testing Architecture

Isolation is a cross-cutting property across every testing level.

It can be represented as:

```text
                Isolation
                    │
        ┌───────────┼───────────┐
        ▼           ▼           ▼
      Unit      Integration   System
        │           │           │
        └───────────┼───────────┘
                    ▼
              Determinism
```

The mechanisms vary by testing level, but the requirement remains.

---

## Relationship With Test Data and Fixtures

Test data and fixture design provide the practical mechanisms for establishing isolated state.

Fixtures should create the required environment and automatically remove it afterward.

---

## Relationship With Mocks and Test Doubles

Test doubles help replace uncontrolled dependencies.

They should improve determinism without removing the behavior belonging to the test scope.

---

## Relationship With Coverage Model

Coverage metrics assume stable test execution.

Isolation and determinism are therefore foundational to accurate coverage measurement.

---

## Relationship With Test Execution

Parallelization, selective execution, sharding, and repeated execution all depend on strong isolation.

The FamilyOS test execution strategy can scale only when tests do not depend on hidden shared state.

---

## Relationship With CI

CI environments expose isolation defects more frequently because they may:

* execute tests differently;
* use parallel workers;
* run on clean machines;
* use different scheduling;
* lack developer-specific configuration.

A test that fails only in CI should first be investigated for hidden environmental assumptions.

---

## Governance

Test isolation and determinism are governed by the FamilyOS Testing Framework and broader engineering standards.

Relevant sources include:

* Engineering Foundation;
* Testing Framework;
* Quality Framework;
* Build Framework;
* Runtime Architecture;
* Configuration Architecture;
* Plugin Architecture;
* Data Architecture;
* Security Architecture;
* applicable ADRs;
* applicable RFCs.

Mandatory testing infrastructure must preserve reproducible behavior.

---

## Evolution Strategy

FamilyOS should strengthen isolation and determinism as the platform grows.

Future improvements may include:

* automatic randomized test ordering;
* default parallel execution;
* network-access blocking;
* leaked resource detection;
* isolated runtime test harnesses;
* disposable database environments;
* deterministic clock utilities;
* deterministic ID providers;
* centralized test environment builders;
* automatic environment-state verification;
* flakiness dashboards;
* automatic flaky-test detection;
* hermetic integration environments;
* stronger process isolation.

Evolution should improve reliability without unnecessarily increasing test complexity.

## Final Principle

Isolation and determinism are prerequisites for trustworthy automated validation.

The fundamental rule is:

> A test must control every dependency that can change its result while preserving every behavior required by the testing level.

By eliminating hidden state, uncontrolled time, accidental environment dependencies, external variability, and cross-test interference, FamilyOS can maintain a test suite whose failures are meaningful, whose successes are credible, and whose results can safely support engineering and release decisions.
