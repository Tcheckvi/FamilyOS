# EPIC-TST-001

## Testing Framework

### Epic Overview

The Testing Framework establishes the official testing operating model for the FamilyOS ecosystem.

Its purpose is to define how testing activities are organized, governed, integrated, and continuously improved across the platform.

The Testing Framework ensures that FamilyOS software evolution remains reliable, predictable, and validated throughout its lifecycle.

## Epic Identifier

```yaml
epic:
  id: EPIC-TST-001
  name: Testing Framework
  domain: Testing
  status: Draft
  version: 1.0.0
```

---

## Vision

FamilyOS requires a testing approach that supports long-term software evolution.

The Testing Framework provides the foundation required to:

* prevent regressions;
* validate technical decisions;
* improve software confidence;
* support continuous delivery;
* maintain platform reliability.

Testing is considered a core engineering capability rather than a final verification activity.

---

## Objectives

The Testing Framework aims to establish:

### Consistent Testing Practices

Define common testing expectations across all FamilyOS components.

---

### Reliable Validation Processes

Ensure that changes are verified through appropriate validation strategies.

---

### Automated Quality Protection

Promote automation to detect problems early and reduce manual errors.

---

### Continuous Confidence

Provide confidence that the platform can evolve safely.

---

### Traceable Testing Knowledge

Ensure testing practices remain documented and understandable.

---

## Scope

The Testing Framework covers:

### Testing Strategy

Defines the role of testing within the FamilyOS lifecycle.

---

### Testing Organization

Defines how testing responsibilities are structured.

---

### Testing Lifecycle Integration

Defines how testing interacts with development activities.

---

### Automation Principles

Defines the role of automated testing.

---

### Validation Governance

Defines how testing decisions are managed and maintained.

---

### Framework Integration

Defines relationships with:

* Engineering Foundation;
* Quality Framework;
* Build Framework;
* Release Framework;
* Documentation Framework.

---

## Out of Scope

The Testing Framework does not directly define:

* individual test cases;
* application-specific test implementation;
* plugin-specific testing logic;
* programming language testing syntax;
* external testing tools configuration.

These concerns belong to dedicated testing standards and implementation documentation.

---

## Relationship With Testing Domain Documentation

The Testing Framework operates together with the Testing documentation domain.

## Expected Deliverables

EPIC-TST-001 will provide:

* Testing Framework vision;
* Testing architecture model;
* Testing lifecycle model;
* Testing governance model;
* Testing integration strategy;
* Validation approach;
* Release documentation;
* Implementation checklist.

---

## Dependencies

The Testing Framework depends on:

### Engineering Foundation

Provides general engineering principles.

Reference:

```text
EPIC-ENG-001 — Engineering Foundation
```

---

### Documentation Framework

Provides documentation standards.

Reference:

```text
EPIC-DOC-001 — Documentation Framework
```

---

## Future Integration

The Testing Framework will support:

### Quality Framework

Testing results contribute to quality evaluation.

---

### Build Framework

Testing becomes part of build validation.

---

### Release Framework

Testing provides release confidence.

---

## Success Criteria

EPIC-TST-001 is successful when:

* testing responsibilities are clearly defined;
* testing practices are structured;
* validation workflows are documented;
* automation principles are established;
* integration with engineering processes is clear.

---

## Final Statement

EPIC-TST-001 establishes the official Testing Framework for FamilyOS.

It transforms testing from an isolated activity into a structured engineering capability supporting reliability, quality, and sustainable platform evolution.
