# Testing Framework

## Changelog

All notable changes to **EPIC-TST-001 — Testing Framework** are documented in this file.

This changelog provides a concise release-oriented record of the evolution of the FamilyOS Testing Framework.

Detailed architectural history is maintained separately in `Revision-History.md`.

---

## Changelog Principles

This changelog records changes that materially affect:

* Testing Framework documentation;
* testing architecture;
* normative testing requirements;
* testing standards;
* automation;
* testing gates;
* governance;
* validation;
* implementation requirements.

Minor spelling, formatting, and editorial corrections do not require individual entries unless they alter meaning.

## Versioning

The Testing Framework follows the FamilyOS versioning strategy.

Conceptually:

```text id="cvg6aj"
MAJOR

## Architectural Baseline

Version 1.0.0 establishes the following testing architecture:

```text id="i1c67x"

        │
        ▼
Testing Strategy
        │
        ▼
Appropriate Testing Levels

Automation
        │
        ▼
Testing Gates
        │
        ▼
Engineering Decision
```

---

## Core Principles Established

Version 1.0.0 establishes that:

* testing is a continuous engineering responsibility;
* tests are maintained engineering assets;
* deterministic tests are required for trustworthy validation;
* test isolation is fundamental;
* testing levels must be selected according to validation purpose;
* regression tests protect previously corrected defects;
* test coverage is evidence, not a quality objective by itself;
* test execution performance matters;
* reporting must make failures actionable;
* CI should automate repeatable validation;
* testing gates must consume current and complete evidence;
* missing evidence must not become success;
* flaky tests are defects;
* quarantine must remain temporary;
* testing exceptions must remain explicit;
* testing infrastructure requires ownership;
* the Testing Framework itself must be validated.

---

## Official Plugin Integration

Version 1.0.0 establishes Testing Framework applicability to official FamilyOS plugins.

Plugin validation may include:

```text id="7edz27"
Capabilities
Policies
Rules
Recipes
Contributions
Contracts
Runtime Integration
Metadata
```

The exact validation profile depends on plugin architecture.

---

## Quality Framework Integration

The Testing Framework is positioned as a source of engineering evidence for the FamilyOS Quality Framework.

```text id="npt4bb"
Testing
   │
   ▼

   │

Quality Evaluation
```

Testing remains one component of broader quality governance.

---

## Engineering Foundation Integration

The Testing Framework builds on FamilyOS Engineering Foundation requirements for:

* repository organization;
* development workflow;
* tooling;
* coding standards;
* governance;
* lifecycle management.

---

## Build and Release Integration

The Testing Framework establishes the validation foundation required by FamilyOS build and release processes.

```text id="t9a7yc"
Source
  │
  ▼
Build
  │
  ▼
Testing
  │
  ▼
Quality Gates
  │
  ▼

```

---

## Validation Model Established

Version 1.0.0 explicitly distinguishes:

```text id="43elzf"
Documented
    │
    ▼
Implemented
    │
    ▼
Validated
    │
    ▼
Operational
```

These states must not be treated as equivalent.

---

## Future Roadmap

The initial baseline identifies future capabilities including:

* standardized execution profiles;
* expanded CI enforcement;
* structured historical test health;
* advanced flaky-test detection;
* optimized parallel execution;
* test sharding;
* dependency-aware test selection;
* compatibility matrices;
* plugin conformance testing;
* plugin certification;
* advanced performance gates;
* quality intelligence;
* AI-assisted testing.

These capabilities remain roadmap items until explicitly implemented, validated, and promoted through framework governance.

---

## Deprecated

None.

This is the initial Testing Framework baseline.

---

## Removed

None.

This is the initial Testing Framework baseline.

---

## Breaking Changes

None.

This is the initial Testing Framework baseline.

---

## Migration

Existing FamilyOS tests may progressively migrate toward the Testing Framework standards.

Migration priorities should favor:

* shared platform infrastructure;
* high-risk behavior;
* official plugins;
* public contracts;
* frequently modified components;
* historical regression areas.

Existing tests do not need to be rewritten merely to satisfy cosmetic consistency where they already provide reliable validation.

---

## Validation

The Testing Framework baseline should be validated according to:

```text id="eqtwyf"
22-Validation.md
```

Implementation progress should be evaluated using:

```text id="37i8ze"
23-Implementation-Checklist.md
```

---

## Changelog Entry Template

Future releases should follow this structure:

```text id="4tk1uq"
# [X.Y.Z] — Title

Status:
Date:

## Added
...

## Changed
...

## Deprecated
...

## Removed
...

## Fixed
...

## Security

## Validation

```

Only relevant sections need to be included.

---

## Maintenance

This changelog should be updated whenever a release or significant revision changes the Testing Framework baseline.

It should remain concise enough to answer:

* what changed;
* when it changed;
* whether compatibility changed;
* whether migration is required;
* how the change was validated.

Detailed architectural reasoning belongs in the relevant framework documents, RFCs, ADRs, or `Revision-History.md`.

---

## Current Version

```text id="0s6g6m"
EPIC-TST-001
Testing Framework
Version 1.0.0
Status: Initial Baseline
```

---

## Final Principle

The changelog records the evolution of the Testing Framework without replacing its architecture documentation.

Its governing principle is:

> Record meaningful framework changes clearly enough that engineers can understand what changed, what it affects, and whether action is required.

The Testing Framework must evolve deliberately.

Its history must remain visible.
