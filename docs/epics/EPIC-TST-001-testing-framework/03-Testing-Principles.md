# Testing Framework

## 03 Testing Principles

### Introduction

The FamilyOS Testing Framework is governed by a set of explicit testing principles.

These principles define how testing must be designed, executed, reviewed, automated, interpreted, and evolved across the FamilyOS ecosystem.

They provide a stable foundation for:

* unit testing;
* integration testing;
* functional testing;
* system testing;
* contract testing;
* regression testing;
* plugin validation;
* continuous integration;
* release validation;
* future compliance integration.

The principles apply independently of individual testing tools.

They describe the expected engineering behavior of the testing system rather than the syntax of a particular test framework.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of the Testing Principles is to establish a common testing philosophy for FamilyOS.

The principles ensure that testing remains:

* intentional;
* deterministic;
* maintainable;
* trustworthy;
* appropriately scoped;
* repeatable;
* observable;
* traceable;
* compatible with automation;
* useful as engineering evidence.

The Testing Framework must prevent testing from becoming an accumulation of isolated test cases without a coherent engineering model.

---

## Governing Principle

The governing principle of the FamilyOS Testing Framework is:

> Testing must provide reliable evidence about system behavior at the lowest appropriate cost and at the earliest useful point in the engineering lifecycle.

Testing exists to create confidence.

It must not create confidence that cannot be justified by evidence.

---

## Testing Is An Engineering Capability

Testing is a permanent engineering capability.

It is not:

* an activity performed only before release;
* a final verification phase;
* a responsibility isolated to a testing team;
* a collection of scripts disconnected from architecture;
* a substitute for engineering design.

Testing begins during design.

Testability must therefore influence:

* architecture;
* interfaces;
* dependency boundaries;
* configuration;
* data design;
* plugin contracts;
* lifecycle decisions.

---

## Testability By Design

FamilyOS components should be designed so that important behavior can be tested without unnecessary environmental complexity.

Testability includes:

* explicit dependencies;
* deterministic interfaces;
* clear boundaries;
* replaceable external dependencies;
* controlled side effects;
* observable outcomes;
* stable contracts.

Code that is difficult to test may indicate architectural coupling.

Testing difficulty should therefore be treated as an engineering signal.

---

## Test The Contract

Tests should validate meaningful behavior and contracts.

They should avoid depending unnecessarily on internal implementation details.

A useful test normally validates:

```text
Input
  │
  ▼
Public or Governed Contract
  │
  ▼
Observable Behavior
```

rather than:

```text
Internal implementation sequence
```

Implementation-detail tests may be appropriate when those details are themselves contractual or security-critical.

---

## Test At The Appropriate Level

Every behavior should be tested at the lowest testing level capable of validating it correctly.

The preferred model is:

```text
Unit
  │
  ▼
Integration
  │
  ▼
Contract
  │
  ▼
Functional
  │
  ▼
System
```

Higher-level tests are not automatically better.

They usually introduce:

* more dependencies;
* higher execution cost;
* slower feedback;
* more complex failures;
* more environmental variability.

Testing level must therefore match the behavior being validated.

---

## Layered Confidence

FamilyOS uses multiple testing levels because no single test type can provide sufficient confidence.

Different levels answer different questions.

Examples:

```text
Unit Test
  -> Does this isolated behavior work?

Integration Test
  -> Do these components collaborate correctly?

Contract Test
  -> Does this boundary honor its contract?

Functional Test
  -> Does the requested capability behave correctly?

System Test
  -> Does the assembled system operate correctly?
```

Confidence emerges from the combination of appropriate evidence.

---

## Fast Feedback

Testing should provide feedback as early as practical.

Local development tests should prioritize:

* fast startup;
* deterministic execution;
* targeted scope;
* actionable failures.

Slow validation should be reserved for cases where broader scope is required.

The testing architecture should support progressive feedback:

```text
Local Fast Tests
       │
       ▼
Pull Request Validation
       │
       ▼
Integration Validation
       │
       ▼
Release Validation
```

---

## Determinism

Tests must be deterministic whenever the behavior being tested is deterministic.

Given equivalent:

```text
Code
Configuration
Dependencies
Test Data
Environment
```

the test result should remain equivalent.

Unexpected result variation undermines trust in the testing system.

---

## Flaky Tests Are Defects

A flaky test is a test that produces inconsistent results without a meaningful change in system behavior.

Flaky tests are defects.

They must not be normalized as ordinary engineering noise.

Common causes include:

* uncontrolled time;
* random ordering;
* concurrency races;
* shared mutable state;
* external services;
* asynchronous timing assumptions;
* environment dependence;
* unstable test data.

Flaky tests should be repaired, isolated, or temporarily governed through an explicit exception process.

---

## Repeatability

Tests should be repeatable.

A developer should be able to reproduce a relevant CI failure locally when the required environment and evidence are available.

Repeatability requires control over:

* dependency versions;
* test data;
* configuration;
* time;
* random values;
* environment variables;
* filesystem state;
* external services.

---

## Isolation

Tests should minimize unintended dependency on other tests.

A test should not normally depend on:

* execution order;
* mutations performed by a previous test;
* global state left behind by another test;
* shared temporary files;
* shared external resources without coordination.

Isolation improves:

* determinism;
* parallel execution;
* debugging;
* reproducibility.

---

## Independent Failure

One failing test should not unnecessarily prevent unrelated tests from executing.

Testing infrastructure should favor independent execution where possible.

This allows engineers to see the complete failure surface rather than only the first failure.

Exceptions may exist for prerequisite validation or catastrophic environment failure.

---

## Explicit Dependencies

Every meaningful test dependency should be visible.

Examples include:

* databases;
* filesystem resources;
* network services;
* environment variables;
* external APIs;
* runtime services;
* plugins;
* configuration providers.

Hidden dependencies make tests difficult to reproduce and reason about.

---

## Controlled External Systems

Tests should not rely on uncontrolled external systems unless the testing level explicitly requires real external integration.

External systems introduce:

* availability risk;
* network variability;
* data instability;
* rate limits;
* credential requirements;
* cost;
* privacy concerns.

When external integration is not the subject of the test, appropriate test doubles should be used.

---

## Real Integration Where It Matters

Test doubles must not eliminate the behavior that a test is intended to validate.

For example, an integration test should not replace every integration boundary with mocks and then claim integration confidence.

The governing question is:

> Which real interaction must exist for this test to provide meaningful evidence?

---

## Prefer Stable Test Doubles

When test doubles are appropriate, they should be:

* explicit;
* minimal;
* deterministic;
* contract-aligned;
* easy to understand.

Test doubles should not reproduce entire production systems unnecessarily.

---

## No Mocking Without Purpose

Mocking is not an objective.

Mocks are tools for controlling dependencies and observing interaction.

Excessive mocking can create tests that validate assumptions about implementation rather than actual behavior.

FamilyOS should prefer:

```text
Real object
```

when it is inexpensive and deterministic.

Use a test double when isolation or control provides meaningful value.

---

## Assertions Must Be Meaningful

Every assertion must represent a meaningful expectation.

Tests should avoid:

* assertions that cannot fail meaningfully;
* overly broad assertions;
* incidental implementation assertions;
* assertions duplicated without additional value.

A failure should communicate what expected behavior was violated.

---

## Failure Messages Must Be Actionable

A failed test should help identify:

* what failed;
* what was expected;
* what was observed;
* where relevant, which input or contract was involved.

Test reporting must reduce diagnostic cost.

---

## One Primary Reason To Fail

A test should normally focus on one primary behavioral expectation.

This does not mean every test must contain exactly one assertion.

Multiple assertions may be appropriate when they collectively validate one coherent behavior.

Tests that validate unrelated behaviors should be split.

---

## Clear Arrange Act Assert Structure

Tests should make their logical structure understandable.

A common model is:

```text
Arrange
  │
  ▼
Act
  │
  ▼
Assert
```

Equivalent structures may be used where appropriate.

The objective is clarity, not rigid syntax.

---

## Descriptive Test Names

Test names should communicate behavior.

A useful test name should allow an engineer to understand the scenario without reading the entire implementation.

Names should favor concepts such as:

```text
given_condition_when_action_then_expected_result
```

or another repository-approved equivalent.

Naming standards may vary by testing style, but ambiguity should be avoided.

---

## Tests Are Production Engineering Assets

Test code must be maintained with engineering discipline.

Tests require:

* readable code;
* clear abstractions;
* appropriate reuse;
* code review;
* refactoring;
* documentation where necessary.

Low-quality test code eventually reduces the reliability of the entire engineering system.

---

## Avoid Test Duplication

Repeated test setup and duplicated scenarios should be reduced when abstraction improves clarity.

However, test abstraction must not hide the scenario being validated.

The preferred principle is:

> Remove duplication without removing intent.

---

## Prefer Explicit Tests Over Clever Tests

Testing infrastructure should optimize for readability.

Complex metaprogramming, dynamic generation, or highly abstract fixtures should be used only when their benefits exceed their diagnostic cost.

A developer investigating a failing test should be able to understand it quickly.

---

## Test Data Must Be Intentional

Test data must exist for a reason.

Data should represent:

* valid cases;
* boundary cases;
* invalid cases;
* known regressions;
* important domain states.

Large datasets should not be introduced without a clear testing objective.

---

## Minimal Test Data

Prefer the smallest data set that proves the behavior.

Smaller data:

* improves clarity;
* accelerates execution;
* reduces debugging complexity;
* reduces maintenance cost.

Representative large-scale datasets remain appropriate for performance and system testing.

---

## Boundary Testing

Important boundaries must be tested deliberately.

Common boundaries include:

* minimum values;
* maximum values;
* empty values;
* nullability;
* zero;
* invalid formats;
* version boundaries;
* lifecycle transitions;
* permission boundaries.

Boundary behavior must not be left to accidental coverage.

---

## Negative Testing

FamilyOS tests must validate failure behavior where failure is meaningful.

Negative testing should verify:

* invalid input rejection;
* unsupported operation handling;
* authorization failures;
* dependency failures;
* malformed configuration;
* contract violations.

Testing only successful paths does not provide sufficient evidence.

---

## Error Behavior Is A Contract

Errors are observable system behavior.

Tests should validate relevant error semantics including:

* exception type;
* error code;
* failure state;
* rollback behavior;
* diagnostic information.

Tests should avoid depending on unstable wording unless exact wording is contractual.

---

## Regression Protection

Every significant defect should lead to a regression test when the defect can be reproduced through automated testing.

The expected flow is:

```text
Defect
  │
  ▼
Reproduction
  │
  ▼
Regression Test
  │
  ▼
Fix
  │
  ▼
Permanent Protection
```

A regression test proves both that the defect existed and that it remains fixed.

---

## Tests Must Fail Before The Fix Where Practical

When adding a regression test, engineers should confirm that the test detects the original defect whenever practical.

A test that passes before the fix may not provide meaningful regression protection.

---

## Coverage Is Evidence, Not Quality

Coverage metrics provide information about test execution.

They do not prove correctness.

High coverage can coexist with:

* weak assertions;
* duplicated tests;
* incorrect assumptions;
* untested edge cases.

FamilyOS therefore treats coverage as one testing signal rather than an independent quality guarantee.

---

## Coverage Must Be Interpretable

Coverage reports should help identify untested risk.

They should not encourage meaningless tests written solely to increase a percentage.

Coverage goals should support engineering confidence.

---

## Risk-Based Testing

Testing effort should reflect engineering risk.

Higher-risk areas may require stronger testing because of:

* security impact;
* data integrity impact;
* platform criticality;
* architectural centrality;
* compatibility impact;
* recovery complexity.

Low-risk implementation details may require less extensive validation.

---

## Critical Paths Require Stronger Evidence

Critical platform paths should receive stronger testing.

Examples may include:

* identity;
* security boundaries;
* persistence;
* plugin loading;
* configuration resolution;
* migrations;
* compatibility decisions;
* release-critical workflows.

The exact required testing levels should be defined by relevant policies and profiles.

---

## Security Testing Is Integrated

Security-related testing should not exist as an isolated afterthought.

Where applicable, tests should cover:

* authorization;
* validation;
* trust boundaries;
* unsafe configuration;
* secret handling;
* privilege boundaries;
* failure behavior.

The Security Architecture remains authoritative for security requirements.

---

## Compatibility Testing

FamilyOS evolves through versions.

Testing must help validate compatibility across:

* public APIs;
* plugin interfaces;
* manifests;
* configuration;
* persisted data;
* framework contracts.

Compatibility claims require explicit evidence.

---

## Migration Testing

Changes that modify persistent structures or contracts should include migration validation where relevant.

Migration tests should verify:

* previous supported state;
* migration operation;
* resulting state;
* failure handling;
* backward or forward compatibility as required.

---

## Tests Must Be Version-Aware

Some behavior is valid only for specific platform or contract versions.

Tests should express relevant version assumptions explicitly.

Hidden version assumptions create fragile validation.

---

## Parallel-Safe Testing

Tests should support parallel execution whenever their semantics permit it.

Parallel safety requires control over:

* ports;
* temporary directories;
* database identifiers;
* global variables;
* caches;
* shared services.

Tests that require serialization must declare that requirement.

---

## Execution Performance Matters

Test performance affects developer behavior.

Slow tests reduce feedback frequency and can encourage developers to bypass validation.

The Testing Framework should therefore measure and manage:

* suite duration;
* slow tests;
* startup cost;
* resource usage;
* parallelization efficiency.

Performance optimization must not weaken correctness.

---

## Fast Tests Must Remain Fast

Fast test suites should have explicit performance expectations.

A unit-test suite that gradually becomes slow loses its architectural role.

Testing levels should therefore preserve their expected feedback characteristics.

---

## No Silent Test Skipping

Tests must not be silently skipped.

Skipped tests should remain visible with an explicit reason.

Long-lived skipped tests should be reviewed.

A permanently irrelevant test should be removed rather than indefinitely skipped.

---

## Expected Failures Must Be Governed

Known failing tests must not become normal background noise.

Temporary expected failures require:

* explicit reason;
* ownership;
* review;
* expiry where appropriate.

The default objective remains:

```text
Required Test Suite
        │
        ▼
PASS
```

---

## Quarantine Is Temporary

A quarantine mechanism may be used for unstable tests when necessary to protect engineering flow.

Quarantine must not become permanent storage for unreliable tests.

Every quarantined test should have:

* owner;
* reason;
* remediation action;
* review date.

---

## Local And CI Semantics Must Match

Local test execution and CI test execution should use equivalent testing semantics.

Differences may exist in:

* scale;
* environment;
* parallelization;
* reporting;
* credentials.

But the meaning of test outcomes must remain equivalent.

A test that passes locally and fails systematically in CI because of uncontrolled environmental differences indicates a testing-system defect.

---

## One Canonical Test Meaning

A test result must mean the same thing across consumers.

For example:

```text
PASS
```

must not mean one thing locally and something materially different in CI.

Tool-specific states may be normalized into a canonical testing result model.

---

## Testing Produces Evidence

Test execution produces engineering evidence.

Useful evidence may include:

* test identity;
* test result;
* suite identity;
* duration;
* environment;
* source revision;
* tool version;
* failure diagnostics.

This evidence may later be consumed by:

* Quality Framework;
* Plugin Compliance Framework;
* Build Framework;
* Release Framework;
* certification workflows.

---

## Evidence Must Be Traceable

Testing evidence should be traceable to the code and environment that produced it.

At minimum, important automated evidence should be associated where possible with:

* source revision;
* test suite;
* execution environment;
* tool version;
* timestamp;
* configuration.

High-assurance workflows may require stronger provenance.

---

## Test Results Are Immutable Historical Facts

A recorded test result describes what happened during a specific execution.

Later retries must not rewrite previous evidence.

Historical results may be superseded by newer evidence but should remain distinguishable.

---

## Test Retry Does Not Erase Failure

Retry may be useful for diagnosing infrastructure instability.

A successful retry must not automatically make the original failure disappear from diagnostic evidence.

Repeated retry dependence should trigger investigation.

---

## Infrastructure Failures Are Distinct

A test failure and a testing-infrastructure failure are not equivalent.

Examples of infrastructure failure include:

* environment provisioning failure;
* unavailable runner;
* broken test dependency;
* CI service failure;
* corrupted cache.

The reporting model should preserve this distinction.

---

## Test Failures Must Be Classified Appropriately

Testing infrastructure should support useful failure categories when possible.

Examples:

```text
ASSERTION_FAILURE
SETUP_FAILURE
TEARDOWN_FAILURE
TIMEOUT
INFRASTRUCTURE_ERROR
DEPENDENCY_ERROR
CONFIGURATION_ERROR
```

Exact classifications belong to the reporting architecture.

---

## Timeouts Are Required For Potentially Unbounded Tests

Tests that could hang indefinitely must have appropriate timeout protection.

Timeouts should reflect expected behavior.

A timeout is an engineering failure signal, not merely an execution inconvenience.

---

## Time Must Be Controllable

Tests that depend on time should avoid uncontrolled wall-clock behavior.

Where appropriate, use:

* injected clocks;
* controlled timestamps;
* deterministic scheduling;
* explicit time windows.

Sleeping for arbitrary periods should be avoided when deterministic synchronization is possible.

---

## Randomness Must Be Reproducible

Tests using randomness should make failures reproducible.

Useful mechanisms include:

* fixed seeds;
* logged seeds;
* deterministic generators.

Randomized or property-based tests must preserve enough information to reproduce failing cases.

---

## Property-Based Testing

Property-based testing may be used when behavior is better expressed through invariants than through manually enumerated examples.

It should complement rather than obscure explicit scenario testing.

Failures must remain reproducible.

---

## Parameterized Testing

Parameterized tests are appropriate when the same behavioral rule should be validated across multiple representative inputs.

Parameterization should improve clarity.

A large data matrix that obscures failure intent should be split or reorganized.

---

## Snapshot Testing Requires Discipline

Snapshot tests may be appropriate for structured outputs.

Snapshots must be reviewed as assertions.

Updating a snapshot must not become a mechanism for automatically accepting behavioral change.

Snapshot changes should be understandable in code review.

---

## Golden Files Are Contracts

Golden files should be treated as explicit expected outputs.

They require:

* version control;
* intentional updates;
* readable diffs where practical;
* clear ownership.

Blind regeneration is not sufficient validation.

---

## Database Tests Must Control State

Tests involving persistence must control database state.

Recommended approaches may include:

* transaction rollback;
* isolated databases;
* disposable schemas;
* deterministic fixtures.

Shared long-lived mutable test databases should be avoided.

---

## Filesystem Tests Must Be Isolated

Filesystem tests should use controlled temporary locations.

They must avoid accidental dependence on:

* developer home directories;
* repository artifacts;
* unrelated system files;
* previous test execution.

Cleanup must be reliable.

---

## Network Tests Must Be Explicit

Any test requiring network access must declare that dependency.

Network tests should be separated appropriately from deterministic local suites.

Unexpected external network access from ordinary unit tests should be treated as a defect.

---

## Secret Safety

Tests must not expose production secrets.

Test credentials must be:

* non-production;
* scoped appropriately;
* protected in CI;
* absent from committed test fixtures.

Logs and failure reports must avoid leaking sensitive data.

---

## Privacy-Aware Test Data

Test data should avoid unnecessary use of real personal information.

Synthetic or anonymized data should be preferred.

Any use of production-derived data requires appropriate governance.

---

## Reusable Fixtures Must Remain Understandable

Fixtures reduce setup duplication.

However, deeply nested or globally implicit fixtures can obscure test behavior.

A fixture should have:

* clear purpose;
* limited scope;
* predictable lifecycle;
* understandable dependencies.

---

## Fixture Scope Must Match Need

Fixtures should use the narrowest practical scope.

For example:

```text
Test
Class
Module
Session
```

Broad fixture scope increases shared state risk.

---

## Shared Utilities Must Have Stable Contracts

Common testing utilities should be treated as reusable infrastructure.

They require:

* stable behavior;
* tests;
* documentation;
* compatibility consideration.

Breaking shared testing utilities can invalidate large portions of the test suite.

---

## Testing Framework Must Not Duplicate Domain Logic

Tests should validate domain behavior.

Test infrastructure should not reimplement business rules merely to calculate expected outcomes.

Duplicated business logic can allow both production and test code to be wrong in the same way.

Expected values should be derived independently where possible.

---

## Tests Must Remain Understandable During Failure

The most important moment for test readability is when something breaks.

A testing abstraction is successful only if engineers can still understand:

* scenario;
* input;
* expected result;
* observed result;
* dependency context.

---

## Test Maintenance Is Continuous

Tests evolve with the platform.

Maintenance includes:

* removing obsolete tests;
* strengthening weak tests;
* improving fixtures;
* reducing duplication;
* repairing flaky tests;
* updating contracts;
* improving execution speed.

Testing debt is engineering debt.

---

## Obsolete Tests Must Be Removed

A test that validates behavior no longer supported should be removed or explicitly migrated.

Keeping obsolete tests creates confusion and slows the suite.

Historical behavior belongs in version history, not necessarily in the current executable suite.

---

## Review Tests With Production Code

Changes to production behavior should normally include corresponding test review.

Code review should ask:

* Is the behavior sufficiently tested?
* Is the chosen testing level appropriate?
* Are negative paths covered?
* Is regression protection required?
* Are the tests deterministic?
* Are the assertions meaningful?

---

## Tests Are Part Of The Definition Of Done

Where behavior requires testing, implementation is not complete until appropriate tests exist and pass.

The exact required test scope may vary by component and risk.

---

## No Testing Theater

Tests must exist to provide evidence.

FamilyOS must avoid testing practices that create appearance without confidence.

Examples include:

* meaningless coverage inflation;
* assertions that always pass;
* excessive mocks;
* tests disconnected from requirements;
* suites ignored when failing.

---

## Automation First

Repeatable validation should be automated whenever practical.

Manual testing remains appropriate for areas where automation is:

* technically impractical;
* disproportionately expensive;
* exploratory by nature.

Manual validation must not silently replace required automated regression protection.

---

## Manual Testing Must Be Explicit

When manual testing is required, the process should identify:

* scenario;
* operator;
* expected result;
* observed result;
* environment;
* evidence where appropriate.

Manual validation should remain auditable when used for governed lifecycle decisions.

---

## Exploratory Testing Is Valuable

Exploratory testing complements automated testing.

It is useful for:

* discovering unexpected behavior;
* investigating risk;
* evaluating usability;
* probing integration behavior.

Exploratory testing does not replace deterministic regression suites.

---

## Test Automation Must Serve Engineering

Automation is valuable when it improves:

* reliability;
* speed;
* repeatability;
* observability;
* governance.

Automation that adds complexity without meaningful validation value should be reconsidered.

---

## Testing Must Integrate With Architecture

The Testing Framework must respect FamilyOS architectural boundaries.

Tests must not become a privileged mechanism for bypassing architecture without justification.

Architecture-specific testing requirements belong to appropriate testing profiles and standards.

---

## Testing Must Integrate With Plugins

Official and third-party plugins require consistent testing expectations.

Plugin testing should support:

* plugin-local behavior;
* capability contracts;
* contribution contracts;
* integration with runtime;
* compatibility;
* compliance evidence.

The Plugin Architecture remains authoritative for plugin contracts.

---

## Testing Must Integrate With Quality

Testing produces evidence consumed by quality evaluation.

The Testing Framework answers:

```text
What behavior was validated?
How was it validated?
What was the result?
```

The Quality Framework may answer:

```text
Is the available evidence sufficient for the required quality level?
```

These responsibilities must remain separate.

---

## Testing Must Integrate With Compliance

The Plugin Compliance Framework may consume test evidence.

Compliance must not redefine test execution semantics.

The Testing Framework remains authoritative for test behavior and testing evidence.

Compliance determines whether required testing evidence is sufficient for a compliance profile.

---

## Testing Must Integrate With Build

Build workflows may consume testing results as validation evidence.

Testing should not duplicate build semantics.

The Build Framework determines how test evidence contributes to artifact readiness.

---

## Testing Must Integrate With Release

Release workflows may require stronger testing profiles.

The Release Framework determines which testing evidence is required for release decisions.

Testing provides evidence.

Release governance makes release decisions.

---

## Testing Must Integrate With Documentation

Testing standards, strategies, contracts, and exceptions must remain documented according to the Documentation Framework.

Documentation should explain testing expectations without duplicating executable test logic.

---

## Testing Must Integrate With Governance

Changes to testing policy must be governed.

Examples include changes to:

* required testing levels;
* coverage policy;
* gate behavior;
* exception rules;
* testing profiles;
* evidence requirements.

Governance protects consistency across the ecosystem.

---

## Testing Policies Must Be Versioned

Testing requirements evolve.

Stable policies should have identifiable versions when their interpretation affects lifecycle decisions.

Historical validation should remain interpretable in the context of the policy that existed at execution time.

---

## Exceptions Must Be Explicit

A component that cannot satisfy a testing requirement may require an exception.

Exceptions must not silently weaken the testing framework.

An exception should identify:

* requirement;
* scope;
* rationale;
* owner;
* approval;
* expiry or review condition where appropriate.

---

## Suppressions Must Remain Visible

When a test result or finding is suppressed for presentation purposes, the underlying evidence must remain visible to governed systems.

Suppression must not rewrite history.

---

## Testing Gates Must Be Evidence-Based

A testing gate should consume test evidence and policy.

Conceptually:

```text
Test Evidence
     +
Testing Policy
     +
Lifecycle Context
        │
        ▼
Testing Gate
        │
        ▼
PASS / BLOCK
```

Gate logic should remain explicit.

---

## Fail Closed At High Assurance Boundaries

At high-assurance lifecycle points, missing required testing evidence should not be interpreted as success.

Examples may include:

* official release;
* certification;
* security-critical changes.

The exact gate policy belongs to the relevant lifecycle framework.

---

## Developer Experience Matters

Testing should help developers.

Good testing infrastructure provides:

* fast commands;
* clear failures;
* stable fixtures;
* understandable reports;
* reproducible CI behavior.

Poor developer experience reduces testing adoption and therefore reduces platform confidence.

---

## Simple Commands

Common testing operations should be accessible through simple, documented commands.

Developers should not need deep knowledge of CI internals to reproduce standard validation locally.

---

## Diagnostics Before Enforcement

Before strong blocking gates are introduced, test failures must be sufficiently actionable.

Enforcement without useful diagnostics creates friction rather than quality.

---

## No Hidden Policy

Testing policy must not exist only inside CI scripts or fixture implementations.

Required behavior should be documented and governable.

Executable automation should implement policy rather than invent it.

---

## Continuous Improvement

Testing should improve based on evidence.

Useful indicators may include:

* flaky test count;
* suite duration;
* failure frequency;
* escaped defects;
* coverage gaps;
* slow tests;
* quarantined tests;
* repeated regression areas.

Metrics inform improvement.

They must not replace engineering judgment.

---

## Testing Metrics Must Not Become Targets Without Context

When a metric becomes an isolated target, teams may optimize the number rather than the outcome.

Examples include:

* coverage percentage;
* test count;
* execution count.

Metrics should be interpreted as signals.

---

## Historical Testing Evidence

Important historical test results should remain available when they support:

* release audit;
* certification;
* incident analysis;
* regression investigation;
* governance.

Retention policy belongs to the appropriate infrastructure and governance frameworks.

---

## Testing Evidence Has Context

A test result is meaningful only with sufficient context.

For example:

```text
PASS
```

without knowing:

* which tests;
* which code;
* which environment;
* which configuration;

may be insufficient for a governed decision.

---

## Testing Maturity

The Testing Framework should evolve progressively.

A possible maturity progression is:

```text
Defined
  │
  ▼
Standardized
  │
  ▼
Automated
  │
  ▼
Integrated
  │
  ▼
Evidence-Driven
  │
  ▼
Continuously Improved
```

Maturity describes capability.

It must not be confused with individual test results.

---

## Principle Precedence

When testing principles appear to conflict, use the following precedence:

1. correctness;
2. safety;
3. determinism;
4. meaningful evidence;
5. architectural integrity;
6. maintainability;
7. performance;
8. convenience.

Convenience must not override correctness.

---

## Principle Application

Not every principle applies equally to every test.

For example:

* unit tests prioritize speed and isolation;
* integration tests prioritize real component interaction;
* system tests prioritize assembled behavior;
* performance tests prioritize realistic load;
* security tests prioritize adversarial behavior.

The testing level defines how the principle should be applied.

---

## Principle Review

Testing principles should be reviewed when:

* FamilyOS architecture changes;
* plugin architecture changes;
* major testing tools change;
* CI architecture changes;
* quality policy changes;
* release requirements change;
* compliance requirements change.

Changes must remain governed and versioned.

---

## Testing Principles Summary

The FamilyOS Testing Framework establishes the following core expectations:

```text
Testing is engineering.
Testability is designed.
Behavior is tested at the appropriate level.
Tests are deterministic.
Flaky tests are defects.
Tests are isolated.
Dependencies are explicit.
Assertions are meaningful.
Failures are actionable.
Regression defects receive regression tests.
Coverage is evidence, not quality.

## Testing Principles Invariants

The Testing Framework establishes the following invariants:

1. Required test evidence must never be fabricated.
2. Missing required evidence must never be interpreted as a successful test result.
3. A flaky test must never be treated as reliably passing.
4. A test infrastructure error must remain distinct from a behavioral failure.
5. A retry must not erase historical failure evidence.
6. Coverage percentage must never be treated as proof of correctness.
7. Test doubles must not remove the behavior a test claims to validate.
8. Unit tests must not silently depend on uncontrolled external infrastructure.
9. Test execution order must not be an undeclared dependency.
10. Test policy must not be hidden solely inside automation code.
11. Exceptions must remain explicit and governed.
12. Test results must remain traceable to their execution context.
13. Local and CI test semantics must remain compatible.
14. Testing must respect FamilyOS architecture.
15. Testing evidence may be consumed by other frameworks without those frameworks redefining test semantics.
16. Historical test results must not be rewritten.
17. Security and privacy requirements apply equally to test infrastructure.
18. Testing debt is engineering debt.
19. Stronger lifecycle assurance requires stronger testing evidence.
20. Testing exists to create justified confidence.

## Final Testing Principle

The final testing principle of FamilyOS is:

> A test is valuable only when its result provides trustworthy and actionable evidence about behavior that matters.

The FamilyOS Testing Framework therefore prioritizes meaningful validation over test quantity, deterministic evidence over apparent success, and sustainable engineering confidence over short-term convenience.
