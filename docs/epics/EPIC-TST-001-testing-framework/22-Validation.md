# Testing Framework

## 22 Validation

### Overview

The FamilyOS Testing Framework defines a comprehensive testing architecture, but documentation alone does not demonstrate that the framework is correctly implemented.

The framework itself must therefore be validated.

Framework validation determines whether the testing capabilities described throughout EPIC-TST-001 exist, operate correctly, integrate with the engineering lifecycle, and provide trustworthy evidence.

Validation covers more than successful test execution.

It verifies that the complete testing system behaves according to its intended architecture, including:

* test organization;
* testing levels;
* test isolation;
* deterministic execution;
* fixtures;
* test doubles;
* regression protection;
* execution performance;
* reporting;
* automation;
* continuous integration;
* testing gates;
* governance;
* lifecycle management.

The purpose of validation is to establish objective evidence that the FamilyOS Testing Framework is operational rather than merely documented.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to define the official validation model for EPIC-TST-001.

It establishes:

* validation objectives;
* validation scope;
* validation categories;
* validation evidence;
* framework acceptance criteria;
* structural validation;
* behavioral validation;
* automation validation;
* reporting validation;
* testing gate validation;
* governance validation;
* lifecycle validation;
* regression validation;
* performance validation;
* final framework acceptance.

This document provides the formal bridge between Testing Framework architecture and verified implementation.

---

## Core Principle

The FamilyOS Testing Framework follows this validation principle:

> A framework requirement is not complete until sufficient evidence demonstrates that it has been implemented and behaves as intended.

Documentation defines expectations.

Implementation realizes those expectations.

Validation proves that realization.

---

## Validation Model

The FamilyOS Testing Framework validation model is:

```text
Framework Requirements
        │
        ▼
Implementation
        │
        ▼
Validation
        │
        ▼
Evidence
        │
        ▼
Evaluation
        │
        ├── Conformant
        ├── Partially Conformant
        └── Non-Conformant
        │
        ▼
Framework Decision
```

Validation should produce evidence that can be reviewed independently of implementation intent.

---

## Validation Objectives

Framework validation must determine whether:

* documented testing capabilities exist;
* required testing conventions are implemented;
* test execution is reliable;
* testing levels are usable;
* test isolation is effective;
* deterministic behavior is preserved;
* CI executes required validation;
* reports contain useful evidence;
* testing gates behave correctly;
* governance requirements are represented;
* framework lifecycle mechanisms exist;
* the framework can evolve without losing validation integrity.

---

## Validation Scope

Validation applies to the complete Testing Framework.

The scope includes:

```text
Testing Principles
Testing Architecture
Test Strategy
Testing Levels
Unit Testing
Integration Testing
Functional Testing
System Testing
Contract Testing
Regression Testing
Test Data
Fixtures
Mocks
Test Doubles
Isolation
Determinism
Coverage
Execution
Performance
Reporting
Observability
Automation
CI Integration
Testing Gates
Governance
Lifecycle
Roadmap Implementation
```

Not every requirement must use the same validation technique.

---

## Validation Categories

FamilyOS framework validation is divided into several categories:

```text
Structural Validation
Behavioral Validation
Execution Validation
Integration Validation
Automation Validation
Reporting Validation
Gate Validation
Governance Validation
Lifecycle Validation
Performance Validation
Documentation Validation
```

Together these categories provide framework-level confidence.

---

## Structural Validation

Structural validation determines whether required testing structures exist.

Examples include:

* required test directories;
* configuration files;
* test infrastructure;
* CI workflows;
* reporting configuration;
* framework documentation.

Structural validation answers:

> Does the required framework structure exist?

It does not by itself prove that the structure behaves correctly.

---

## Repository Structure Validation

The repository should be inspected for expected testing structures.

Validation may verify:

* test directories exist;
* tests are discoverable;
* naming conventions are respected;
* framework configuration is present;
* shared test utilities are correctly located.

Where rules are stable and machine-verifiable, structural checks should eventually be automated.

---

## Test Discovery Validation

Test discovery must be validated.

The framework should confirm that:

* expected tests are discovered;
* supported naming conventions work;
* test categories remain discoverable;
* configuration does not silently exclude required tests.

Unexpected reductions in discovered tests should be investigated.

---

## Configuration Validation

Testing configuration should be checked for:

* syntactic correctness;
* supported options;
* marker registration where applicable;
* expected discovery behavior;
* warning policy;
* execution configuration.

Invalid configuration must fail visibly.

---

## Behavioral Validation

Behavioral validation determines whether testing capabilities behave according to their documented semantics.

Examples include:

* fixtures establish expected state;
* cleanup occurs correctly;
* test doubles behave as intended;
* test markers select correct categories;
* regression tests detect protected defects;
* gate policies produce expected outcomes.

Behavioral validation answers:

> Does the framework behave correctly?

---

## Testing Level Validation

Each supported testing level should demonstrate its intended purpose.

Validation should confirm appropriate use of:

* unit tests;
* integration tests;
* functional tests;
* system tests;
* contract tests;
* regression tests.

The objective is not simply to prove that tests bearing those names exist.

Their behavior should correspond to their architectural role.

---

## Unit Testing Validation

Unit testing validation should demonstrate that representative tests:

* isolate meaningful units;
* execute quickly;
* avoid unnecessary infrastructure;
* use deterministic inputs;
* produce meaningful assertions.

Unit testing should provide the shortest reliable behavioral feedback loop.

---

## Integration Testing Validation

Integration testing validation should demonstrate that important component boundaries can be tested reliably.

Representative boundaries may include:

* persistence;
* adapters;
* plugin runtime;
* configuration;
* generation infrastructure;
* service boundaries.

---

## Functional Testing Validation

Where functional testing is used, validation should confirm that tests evaluate meaningful user- or capability-level behavior rather than implementation details.

---

## System Testing Validation

System tests should demonstrate that significant end-to-end platform behavior can be validated in an appropriately controlled environment.

System testing may belong to extended validation rather than routine local execution.

---

## Contract Testing Validation

Contract validation is particularly important for FamilyOS platform and plugin architecture.

Validation should demonstrate that contracts can detect incompatible changes between:

* interfaces;
* capabilities;
* plugins;
* adapters;
* services.

A deliberately incompatible test fixture or controlled mutation may be used to prove that contract validation detects violations.

---

## Regression Testing Validation

Regression testing should demonstrate that corrected defects remain protected.

A representative regression validation may establish:

```text
Known Defect Condition
        │
        ▼
Regression Test
        │
        ▼
Correct Implementation → PASS
Defective Implementation → FAIL
```

The test must be capable of detecting the behavior it claims to protect.

---

## Test Data Validation

Test data mechanisms should be validated for:

* determinism;
* readability;
* isolation;
* reproducibility;
* privacy safety.

Synthetic data should be preferred.

Production personal information should not be required for normal testing.

---

## Fixture Validation

Fixtures should be validated to ensure that they:

* establish required state;
* isolate tests appropriately;
* release resources;
* do not leak mutable state;
* use appropriate lifecycle scope.

Shared fixtures deserve particular attention because defects can affect large portions of the suite.

---

## Test Double Validation

Mocks, stubs, fakes, spies, and other test doubles should be used according to their intended roles.

Validation should confirm that test doubles do not create false confidence by modeling dependencies incorrectly.

Where possible, critical test-double assumptions should also be protected by integration or contract tests.

---

## Isolation Validation

Test isolation must be verified.

Validation may include:

* executing tests individually;
* executing tests in different orders;
* running selected subsets;
* parallel execution where supported.

A test that succeeds only because another test executed first violates the framework.

---

## Order Independence Validation

The framework should periodically demonstrate that tests do not depend on stable ordering.

Randomized or altered execution ordering may be used where tooling supports it.

Failures caused by ordering should be treated as test defects.

---

## Determinism Validation

Representative test suites should produce consistent results across repeated executions under equivalent conditions.

Conceptually:

```text
Run 1 → PASS
Run 2 → PASS
Run 3 → PASS
Run 4 → PASS
```

Inconsistent outcomes require investigation.

---

## Time-Dependent Validation

Tests involving time should demonstrate controlled behavior.

They should avoid unnecessary dependency on:

* wall-clock time;
* real waiting;
* timezone assumptions;
* uncontrolled scheduling.

---

## Randomness Validation

Tests using randomness should remain reproducible where deterministic diagnosis is required.

Seeds or deterministic generators should be used appropriately.

---

## Temporary Resource Validation

Tests using:

* files;
* directories;
* databases;
* sockets;
* subprocesses

should demonstrate correct cleanup.

Residual resources after test completion indicate lifecycle defects.

---

## Execution Validation

The framework must validate that supported execution profiles work as documented.

This may include:

* targeted execution;
* component execution;
* complete suite execution;
* marked execution;
* CI execution;
* release validation.

---

## Targeted Execution Validation

Developers should be able to execute a selected:

* test;
* file;
* component;
* plugin;
* category.

Targeted execution must not require unrelated tests to execute first.

---

## Full-Suite Validation

The complete applicable test suite must execute successfully as a coherent validation mechanism.

Full-suite execution verifies interactions that selective testing may not expose.

---

## Test Selection Validation

Where selective execution is introduced, the selection mechanism must itself be validated.

It should demonstrate that relevant tests are selected for representative changes.

False omission of required tests is a serious framework defect.

---

## Parallel Execution Validation

If tests execute in parallel, validation must demonstrate that concurrency does not introduce:

* race conditions;
* port conflicts;
* filesystem collisions;
* shared-state corruption;
* nondeterministic failures.

Parallelism is only valid when test isolation supports it.

---

## Sharding Validation

If sharding is used, validation should confirm that:

* every required test belongs to a shard;
* no required tests disappear;
* results aggregate correctly;
* failures remain attributable to specific tests.

---

## Performance Validation

The performance of the testing system must be measurable.

Validation should establish baseline information for:

* targeted test duration;
* component suite duration;
* complete suite duration;
* slowest tests;
* CI validation duration.

Exact performance thresholds may evolve.

---

## Performance Regression Validation

Where baselines exist, significant execution-time regressions should be detectable.

The framework should distinguish meaningful regression from ordinary measurement variation.

---

## Timeout Validation

Timeout mechanisms should be tested where they form part of execution policy.

A deliberately blocked test scenario may be used to verify that automation terminates correctly rather than hanging indefinitely.

---

## Reporting Validation

Reporting must be validated according to:

```text
16-Test-Reporting-and-Observability.md
```

Validation should confirm that reports expose:

* executed tests;
* passed tests;
* failures;
* skips;
* duration;
* failure details.

---

## Failure Reporting Validation

A controlled failing test may be used to verify that reporting provides:

* test identity;
* source location;
* assertion information;
* exception details;
* relevant captured output.

A reporting system should be validated under failure, not only successful execution.

---

## Skip Reporting Validation

Controlled skipped tests should demonstrate that:

* skip state is visible;
* reason is visible;
* skip counts appear in summaries.

---

## Retry Reporting Validation

Where retries exist, validation must confirm that retry behavior remains visible.

A retried pass must not become indistinguishable from a deterministic first-attempt pass.

---

## Quarantine Reporting Validation

Where quarantine exists, validation should confirm that quarantined tests remain:

* visible;
* identifiable;
* distinguishable from normal skips.

---

## Structured Report Validation

Machine-readable reports should be checked for:

* correct generation;
* valid structure;
* expected test counts;
* correct statuses;
* source association where required.

---

## Artifact Validation

Where test artifacts are produced, validation should confirm that:

* expected artifacts exist;
* names are understandable;
* artifacts correspond to the correct execution;
* sensitive information is excluded.

---

## Coverage Validation

If coverage is part of the Testing Framework implementation, validation should confirm that:

* coverage measurement executes;
* relevant source is included;
* inappropriate files are excluded;
* reports are generated correctly;
* configured gates evaluate the intended metric.

Coverage numbers themselves are not proof of testing quality.

---

## Automation Validation

CI automation must be validated according to:

```text
17-Automation-and-CI-Integration.md
```

Validation should demonstrate that relevant repository events trigger expected testing workflows.

---

## Pull Request Automation Validation

A representative pull request should demonstrate:

```text
Pull Request
     │
     ▼
Required Validation Triggered
     │
     ▼
Tests Executed
     │
     ▼
Reports Produced
     │
     ▼
Gate Evaluated
```

Failure in required validation should prevent normal protected progression.

---

## Protected Branch Validation

Protected branch configuration should demonstrate that required testing status is enforced where repository governance requires it.

---

## CI Failure Validation

Controlled CI failure scenarios should confirm that:

* failed tests fail the appropriate job;
* failure status propagates;
* diagnostics remain available;
* dependent gates receive the correct result.

---

## CI Environment Validation

CI should demonstrate controlled runtime and dependency environments.

Validation should confirm that execution does not depend on undocumented machine-specific state.

---

## Cache Validation

Where caching is used, validation should ensure that stale caches cannot create incorrect test results.

Cache invalidation behavior should correspond to relevant inputs.

---

## Matrix Validation

If compatibility matrices are implemented, validation should confirm that expected supported combinations execute.

Missing required matrix entries must remain detectable.

---

## Testing Gate Validation

Testing gates must be validated according to:

```text
18-Testing-Gates.md
```

Gate validation must verify both passing and failing behavior.

---

## Positive Gate Validation

When all mandatory evidence satisfies policy:

```text
Required Evidence
      │
      ▼
Valid
      │
      ▼
Gate PASS
```

The protected operation should be allowed.

---

## Negative Gate Validation

When mandatory evidence fails:

```text
Required Evidence
      │
      ▼
Invalid
      │
      ▼
Gate FAIL
```

The protected operation must not proceed normally.

---

## Missing Evidence Validation

A gate must not pass when required evidence is absent.

For example:

```text
Unit Tests        PASS
Integration Tests MISSING
                   │
                   ▼
               NOT PASS
```

This protects against false confidence.

---

## Stale Evidence Validation

Gate validation should demonstrate that results associated with an older source revision cannot incorrectly satisfy current-source requirements.

---

## Skip Policy Validation

Where mandatory-test skip policies exist, controlled scenarios should demonstrate the correct gate result.

---

## Flaky Policy Validation

If gate logic distinguishes flaky results, validation should demonstrate that unstable outcomes remain visible and receive the intended policy treatment.

---

## Waiver Validation

Where waivers are supported, validation should ensure that a waived gate remains distinguishable from a normal pass.

Waivers should remain traceable.

---

## Governance Validation

Governance requirements from:

```text
19-Governance-and-Test-Lifecycle.md
```

must also be validated.

Not every governance rule can be automated.

Some require review evidence.

---

## Ownership Validation

Important testing infrastructure should have identifiable ownership.

Validation may review ownership for:

* shared fixtures;
* CI configuration;
* testing gates;
* plugin test suites;
* shared testing utilities.

---

## Quarantine Governance Validation

Known quarantines should contain the required governance information.

This may include:

* reason;
* owner;
* introduction date;
* remediation expectation.

---

## Exception Validation

Testing exceptions should be:

* documented;
* scoped;
* traceable;
* approved where required.

Undocumented bypasses should be treated as governance defects.

---

## Test Removal Validation

Significant test removal should be reviewable.

Where a test protected a known regression or contract, removal should demonstrate that the behavior is:

* no longer supported; or
* protected elsewhere.

---

## Lifecycle Validation

The Testing Framework lifecycle defined in:

```text
20-Framework-Lifecycle.md
```

requires validation of framework evolution mechanisms.

---

## Version Validation

Where framework versioning is implemented, validation should confirm that:

* current version is identifiable;
* changes are traceable;
* incompatible changes are distinguishable.

---

## Deprecation Validation

Deprecated framework mechanisms should:

* be identifiable;
* provide migration guidance;
* discourage new usage;
* remain scheduled for eventual removal.

---

## Migration Validation

Framework migrations should demonstrate that required validation remains operational throughout transition.

A migration must not create an unprotected period where critical testing silently disappears.

---

## Documentation Validation

The Testing Framework documentation itself must be validated.

Validation should confirm that:

* required documents exist;
* documents are not unintentionally empty;
* naming follows FamilyOS standards;
* references point to valid framework documents;
* terminology remains consistent.

---

## Documentation Completeness

EPIC-TST-001 documentation should cover the complete intended Testing Framework architecture.

Missing framework documents should be detectable before the EPIC is considered complete.

---

## Cross-Reference Validation

References such as:

```text
16-Test-Reporting-and-Observability.md
17-Automation-and-CI-Integration.md
18-Testing-Gates.md
19-Governance-and-Test-Lifecycle.md
20-Framework-Lifecycle.md
21-Roadmap.md
22-Validation.md
23-Implementation-Checklist.md
```

should correspond to actual framework files.

---

## Terminology Validation

Key terminology should remain consistent across framework documentation.

Examples include:

* testing gate;
* quarantine;
* test double;
* regression test;
* execution profile;
* validation evidence.

Conflicting terminology should be corrected.

---

## Security Validation

Testing infrastructure must respect FamilyOS security architecture.

Validation should confirm that tests and CI do not expose:

* credentials;
* secrets;
* authentication tokens;
* private keys.

---

## Secret Leakage Validation

Where appropriate, controlled validation should confirm that sensitive CI values are masked or excluded from:

* logs;
* reports;
* artifacts.

---

## Privacy Validation

Testing should not depend on uncontrolled production personal data.

Validation should review:

* fixtures;
* datasets;
* reports;
* artifacts

for inappropriate sensitive information.

---

## Plugin Validation

Official FamilyOS plugins should demonstrate compliance with the Testing Framework.

Representative plugin validation may include:

* plugin test discovery;
* capability tests;
* policy tests;
* rule tests;
* recipe tests;
* contribution tests;
* contract tests;
* runtime integration.

---

## Shared Framework Validation

Changes to shared platform infrastructure should trigger sufficiently broad validation.

This should include affected official plugins where relevant.

---

## Testing Framework Self-Validation

Testing infrastructure should have tests where appropriate.

Potential subjects include:

* shared test utilities;
* custom fixtures;
* test-selection logic;
* report-processing logic;
* gate evaluation logic;
* automation scripts.

The Testing Framework must not assume its own infrastructure is defect-free.

---

## Validation Evidence

Framework validation should produce evidence.

Evidence may include:

* successful test output;
* structured reports;
* CI results;
* configuration checks;
* coverage reports;
* performance measurements;
* gate results;
* review records;
* repository structure checks.

---

## Evidence Quality

Validation evidence should be:

* relevant;
* reproducible where practical;
* traceable;
* understandable;
* current.

Evidence from obsolete source revisions should not establish current framework conformance.

---

## Evidence Retention

Important framework validation evidence may require retention.

Release-level or framework-baseline validation may justify longer retention than routine developer execution.

---

## Validation Result States

Framework validation may use states such as:

```text
PASS
FAIL
PARTIAL
NOT IMPLEMENTED
NOT APPLICABLE
```

Each state should have clear meaning.

---

## PASS

PASS means the requirement is implemented and sufficient evidence demonstrates expected behavior.

---

## FAIL

FAIL means implementation exists or was expected, but validation demonstrates non-conformance.

---

## PARTIAL

PARTIAL means some required capability exists but full conformance has not yet been demonstrated.

---

## NOT IMPLEMENTED

NOT IMPLEMENTED means the roadmap capability has not yet been introduced.

This may be acceptable for future roadmap features but not for mandatory EPIC completion requirements.

---

## NOT APPLICABLE

NOT APPLICABLE means a requirement legitimately does not apply to the current FamilyOS architecture.

The reason should be understandable.

---

## Validation Matrix

A framework validation matrix may track requirements systematically.

For example:

| Area         | Requirement                 | Evidence            | Status |
| ------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------- | ------ |
| Unit Testing | Unit suite executes         | Test report         | PASS   |
| Isolation    | Tests execute independently | Reordered execution | PASS   |
| Reporting    | Failure details available   | CI report           | PASS   |
| CI           | PR triggers validation      | Workflow result     | PASS   |
| Gates        | Failed tests block gate     | Gate result         | PASS   |

The implementation checklist provides a more detailed operational structure.

---

## Validation Frequency

Different validation activities may occur at different frequencies.

For example:

```text
Every Change
    │
    └── Core automated validation

Protected Branch
    │
    └── Broader validation

Scheduled
    │
    └── Extended validation

Release
    │
    └── Complete required validation

Framework Change
    │
    └── Framework-specific validation
```

---

## Continuous Validation

Where practical, framework conformance should be validated continuously rather than only during EPIC completion.

Continuous validation prevents framework drift.

---

## Framework Drift

Framework drift occurs when implementation gradually diverges from documented standards.

Possible causes include:

* CI modifications;
* new plugins;
* new test patterns;
* deprecated mechanisms remaining active;
* undocumented exceptions.

Validation should help detect drift.

---

## Validation Failures

Framework validation failures should be treated as engineering issues.

The response should determine whether the problem is:

* implementation;
* documentation;
* test infrastructure;
* configuration;
* governance;
* obsolete framework expectation.

The appropriate layer should then be corrected.

---

## Validation Exceptions

A validation requirement may occasionally require temporary exception.

Exceptions should follow established Testing Framework governance.

An exception must not silently convert failed validation into compliance.

---

## EPIC Completion Validation

Before EPIC-TST-001 is considered complete, the framework should undergo a final validation review.

The review should verify at least:

```text
Documentation Complete
        │
        ▼
Structure Valid
        │
        ▼
Core Testing Model Defined
        │
        ▼
Implementation Requirements Identified
        │
        ▼
Validation Criteria Defined
        │
        ▼
Implementation Checklist Complete
```

Because the Testing Framework roadmap includes future maturity stages, EPIC completion does not necessarily mean every long-term roadmap capability is already implemented.

It means the framework foundation is complete, coherent, actionable, and ready for governed implementation and evolution.

---

## Framework Acceptance Criteria

The Testing Framework documentation baseline may be accepted when:

* all required EPIC documents exist;
* documents contain substantive content;
* architecture is internally consistent;
* testing terminology is coherent;
* testing levels are clearly defined;
* execution principles are defined;
* reporting requirements are defined;
* automation architecture is defined;
* testing gates are defined;
* governance is defined;
* framework lifecycle is defined;
* roadmap exists;
* validation requirements exist;
* implementation requirements are trackable.

---

## Implementation Acceptance

Implementation acceptance is stronger than documentation acceptance.

It requires evidence that applicable framework requirements are operational in the repository.

This distinction is important:

```text
Framework Documented
        ≠
Framework Implemented
        ≠
Framework Validated
```

The desired lifecycle is:

```text
Documented
    │
    ▼
Implemented
    │
    ▼
Validated
    │
    ▼
Operational
```

---

## Validation Ownership

Framework validation requires ownership.

Responsibilities include:

* maintaining validation criteria;
* reviewing failed validation;
* updating validation when architecture changes;
* ensuring evidence remains meaningful.

Validation rules without ownership eventually become obsolete.

---

## Validation Evolution

Validation must evolve together with the Testing Framework.

When new capabilities become mandatory, corresponding validation should be introduced.

For example:

```text
New Framework Requirement
        │
        ▼
Implementation
        │
        ▼
New Validation Requirement
```

A mandatory framework capability without a way to verify it creates weak governance.

---

## Automation of Validation

Validation should be automated when:

* the rule is objective;
* automation is reliable;
* repeated manual checking provides little value.

Examples include:

* file existence;
* test execution;
* test discovery;
* report generation;
* configuration validation.

Human review remains appropriate for architectural and governance judgments.

---

## Human Validation

Some requirements cannot be reduced responsibly to automated checks.

Examples include:

* whether a test protects meaningful behavior;
* whether a mock accurately represents a dependency;
* whether testing strategy is proportionate to risk;
* whether a framework exception is justified.

Automation supports engineering judgment.

It does not eliminate it.

---

## Validation and Quality

Testing Framework validation contributes to the broader FamilyOS Quality Framework.

It demonstrates that testing itself is sufficiently trustworthy to provide quality evidence.

If the testing system is unreliable, downstream quality decisions are also weakened.

---

## Anti-Patterns

The following validation practices are discouraged or prohibited.

### Documentation Equals Validation

Written requirements alone do not demonstrate implementation.

---

### Test Suite Pass Equals Framework Validation

A passing test suite does not prove that all Testing Framework requirements are implemented.

---

### Only Validating Success

Failure behavior, skip behavior, gates, and reporting should also be validated.

---

### Manual Validation of Everything

Stable objective rules should be automated where practical.

---

### Automating Subjective Judgment

Not every architectural quality question should be converted into a numerical check.

---

### Stale Evidence

Old results must not establish current framework conformance.

---

### Missing Evidence Treated as Pass

Absence of required validation must remain visible.

---

### Validation Without Ownership

Validation mechanisms require maintenance.

---

### Permanent Exceptions

Repeated validation exceptions indicate unresolved implementation or policy problems.

---

## Relationship With Framework Lifecycle

Validation provides the evidence required by:

```text
20-Framework-Lifecycle.md
```

Framework lifecycle decisions should be based on demonstrated implementation state rather than assumption.

---

## Relationship With Roadmap

The roadmap defined in:

```text
21-Roadmap.md
```

identifies future Testing Framework capabilities.

Validation determines when those capabilities have actually reached their intended maturity.

---

## Relationship With Testing Gates

Testing gates defined in:

```text
18-Testing-Gates.md
```

are themselves subjects of framework validation.

A gate cannot be trusted until both its positive and negative behavior have been demonstrated.

---

## Relationship With Governance

Validation findings feed governance defined in:

```text
19-Governance-and-Test-Lifecycle.md
```

Failures may create:

* remediation work;
* testing debt;
* policy changes;
* migration requirements.

---

## Relationship With Implementation Checklist

The detailed operational verification of Testing Framework implementation is defined in:

```text
23-Implementation-Checklist.md
```

This validation document defines what must be demonstrated.

The implementation checklist records whether those requirements have been addressed.

---

## Success Criteria

The FamilyOS Testing Framework validation model is considered effective when:

* documented requirements can be verified;
* validation covers both structure and behavior;
* test isolation can be demonstrated;
* deterministic execution can be assessed;
* automation can be validated;
* reporting can be validated under failure conditions;
* gates can be tested positively and negatively;
* governance requirements remain reviewable;
* security and privacy constraints are protected;
* validation evidence is traceable;
* missing evidence cannot appear as success;
* framework drift can be detected;
* future roadmap capabilities can receive validation as they mature.

---

## Final Principle

FamilyOS must be able to test its testing system.

The governing principle is:

> Trust in testing must itself be supported by evidence.

The Testing Framework defines how FamilyOS creates confidence in software.

Framework validation defines how FamilyOS creates confidence in that confidence.
