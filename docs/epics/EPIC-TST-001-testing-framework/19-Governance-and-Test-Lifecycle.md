# Testing Framework

## 19 Governance and Test Lifecycle

### Overview

Testing is not a static engineering activity.

Tests, test infrastructure, execution policies, coverage expectations, reporting mechanisms, automation, and testing gates all evolve as the FamilyOS platform changes.

The FamilyOS Testing Framework therefore defines governance and lifecycle rules for the complete testing system.

Testing governance establishes:

* who is responsible for testing policy;
* how testing standards are changed;
* how testing exceptions are handled;
* how testing debt is managed;
* how tests are introduced, maintained, reviewed, deprecated, and removed;
* how the framework remains aligned with the wider FamilyOS engineering platform.

The test lifecycle defines how an individual test moves from initial creation through active maintenance and eventual retirement.

Together, governance and lifecycle management ensure that the testing system remains reliable, relevant, maintainable, and aligned with platform evolution.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to define the official FamilyOS governance model for testing and the lifecycle of testing assets.

It establishes principles and requirements for:

* testing ownership;
* testing responsibilities;
* policy governance;
* test lifecycle management;
* test creation;
* test review;
* test maintenance;
* test evolution;
* test deprecation;
* test removal;
* test debt;
* flaky-test governance;
* quarantine governance;
* testing exceptions;
* testing standards;
* framework changes;
* plugin testing governance;
* lifecycle traceability;
* continuous improvement.

The objective is to prevent the FamilyOS testing system from degrading as the platform grows.

---

## Core Principle

The FamilyOS Testing Framework follows this principle:

> Tests are maintained engineering assets and must be governed throughout their lifecycle.

A test is not complete merely because it was written once.

It must continue to provide valid, reliable, relevant evidence for the behavior it protects.

---

## Testing Governance

Testing governance defines how testing decisions are made and maintained across FamilyOS.

Governance applies to:

* testing standards;
* testing architecture;
* execution policies;
* test categories;
* coverage policy;
* CI integration;
* testing gates;
* reporting standards;
* exception handling;
* framework evolution.

Testing governance must remain consistent with broader FamilyOS engineering governance.

---

## Governance Objectives

The testing governance model exists to ensure that:

* testing expectations remain explicit;
* important behavior remains protected;
* test quality remains high;
* obsolete tests are removed safely;
* flaky tests do not become normalized;
* testing policies remain enforceable;
* exceptions remain visible;
* test debt remains manageable;
* framework changes remain controlled;
* testing evidence remains trustworthy.

---

## Governance Model

The FamilyOS testing governance model can be represented as:

```text
Engineering Principles
        │
        ▼
Testing Framework
        │
        ▼
Testing Policies
        │
        ├── Test Design
        ├── Test Execution
        ├── Coverage
        ├── Reporting
        ├── Automation
        └── Testing Gates
        │
        ▼
Engineering Teams and Components
        │
        ▼
Testing Evidence
        │
        ▼
Review and Improvement
```

Governance provides direction.

Execution produces evidence.

Evidence informs further governance.

---

## Governance Scope

Testing governance applies to all FamilyOS engineering areas that produce or depend on software validation.

This includes:

* core platform components;
* official plugins;
* domain implementations;
* runtime infrastructure;
* CLI functionality;
* adapters;
* integrations;
* generated artifacts;
* testing infrastructure itself.

No component is automatically exempt from testing governance.

---

## Testing Ownership

Testing responsibilities must have identifiable ownership.

Ownership may exist at multiple levels.

For example:

```text
Testing Framework
       │
       ├── Framework Ownership
       │
       ├── Component Ownership
       │
       ├── Plugin Ownership
       │
       └── Infrastructure Ownership
```

Different ownership levels serve different responsibilities.

---

## Framework Ownership

Framework-level ownership is responsible for maintaining:

* testing principles;
* testing architecture;
* testing standards;
* execution model;
* reporting requirements;
* automation policy;
* testing gates;
* lifecycle rules.

Framework ownership should protect consistency across the FamilyOS ecosystem.

---

## Component Ownership

Each significant component should own the tests protecting its behavior.

Component ownership includes responsibility for:

* adding appropriate tests;
* maintaining existing tests;
* fixing broken tests;
* addressing regressions;
* reviewing skipped tests;
* resolving flaky tests;
* maintaining test fixtures.

Tests should not become ownerless infrastructure.

---

## Plugin Ownership

Official FamilyOS plugins are responsible for maintaining testing appropriate to their public behavior.

Plugin testing may include:

* capability tests;
* policy tests;
* rule tests;
* contract tests;
* integration tests;
* runtime tests;
* metadata validation.

Plugin ownership must remain compatible with common FamilyOS testing standards.

---

## Infrastructure Ownership

Testing infrastructure also requires ownership.

This includes:

* test configuration;
* fixtures shared across components;
* CI workflows;
* reporting infrastructure;
* test utilities;
* test runners;
* performance infrastructure.

Broken testing infrastructure can compromise validation across the entire repository.

---

## Shared Responsibility

Testing quality is a shared engineering responsibility.

It must not be treated as the responsibility of a separate validation phase alone.

Developers introducing behavior are expected to consider how that behavior will be validated.

---

## Policy Ownership

Every enforced testing policy should have a clear governance source.

For example:

```text
Policy:
Mandatory integration tests for public plugin contracts

Owner:
Testing Framework governance

Enforcement:
CI + Testing Gate
```

Policies without ownership tend to become inconsistent.

---

## Test Lifecycle

Every test has a lifecycle.

A conceptual test lifecycle is:

```text
Need Identified
      │
      ▼
Test Designed
      │
      ▼
Test Implemented
      │
      ▼
Test Reviewed
      │
      ▼
Test Activated
      │
      ▼
Test Maintained
      │
      ▼
Test Evolved
      │
      ▼
Test Deprecated
      │
      ▼
Test Removed
```

Not every test will pass through every state explicitly, but the lifecycle model provides governance for its evolution.

---

## Need Identification

A test should exist because there is a meaningful behavior, risk, or contract to protect.

Test creation may be triggered by:

* new functionality;
* defect correction;
* new contract;
* architectural change;
* integration requirement;
* regression risk;
* specification requirement;
* release risk.

Tests should not be created merely to increase test counts.

---

## Test Design

Before implementation, the intended validation should be understood.

Test design should consider:

* behavior under test;
* appropriate testing level;
* inputs;
* expected outputs;
* relevant boundaries;
* dependencies;
* failure scenarios;
* test data;
* isolation requirements.

Selecting the correct testing level is part of test design.

---

## Test Implementation

Tests should follow the standards defined by the FamilyOS Testing Framework.

Implementation should prioritize:

* clarity;
* determinism;
* maintainability;
* isolation;
* meaningful assertions;
* appropriate scope;
* fast feedback where possible.

---

## Test Review

Tests should be reviewed as engineering code.

Review should consider whether the test:

* protects meaningful behavior;
* uses the correct testing level;
* has understandable intent;
* contains meaningful assertions;
* avoids unnecessary coupling;
* remains deterministic;
* uses appropriate fixtures;
* does not expose sensitive information.

A test should not receive reduced review quality merely because it is not production code.

---

## Review of Test Changes

Changes to existing tests should be reviewed with the same care as application changes.

A modified test may:

* weaken validation;
* hide a regression;
* remove an assertion;
* change contract expectations;
* introduce instability.

Test changes therefore require engineering scrutiny.

---

## Test Activation

Once accepted, a test should become part of the appropriate execution profile.

For example:

```text
New Unit Test
     │
     ▼
Unit Test Suite
     │
     ▼
CI Fast Validation
```

or:

```text
New System Test
     │
     ▼
Extended Validation
     │
     ▼
Release Profile
```

A test that exists but never executes provides no protection.

---

## Execution Assignment

Each test should have an understood execution location.

Possible locations include:

* developer execution;
* pull request CI;
* protected branch CI;
* nightly validation;
* extended validation;
* release validation.

Tests should not become accidentally orphaned from execution.

---

## Test Maintenance

Active tests must be maintained as the system evolves.

Maintenance may be required because of:

* implementation changes;
* API changes;
* dependency changes;
* fixture evolution;
* performance degradation;
* framework changes.

Maintenance should preserve the original validation purpose unless that purpose itself has changed.

---

## Test Evolution

Some tests need to evolve with platform behavior.

For example:

```text
Original Contract
      │
      ▼
Contract Evolution
      │
      ▼
Test Evolution
```

Tests must reflect the intended current contract rather than preserve obsolete behavior accidentally.

---

## Behavioral Change

When intended application behavior changes, related tests may need modification.

The workflow should distinguish:

```text
Test fails because implementation is wrong
```

from:

```text
Test fails because expected behavior intentionally changed
```

Changing tests merely to make failing implementations pass is prohibited.

---

## Test Refactoring

Tests may be refactored to improve:

* clarity;
* reuse;
* performance;
* fixture structure;
* maintainability.

Refactoring must preserve validation semantics unless behavior changes are intentional and governed.

---

## Test Duplication

Duplicate tests may increase maintenance cost without increasing meaningful confidence.

Duplicate or redundant tests should be consolidated where:

* behavior is identical;
* assertions are equivalent;
* additional coverage value is negligible.

However, tests at different levels may legitimately validate the same behavior from different perspectives.

---

## Test Relevance

Active tests should remain relevant to supported behavior.

A test may become obsolete when:

* a feature is removed;
* a contract is retired;
* an architecture is replaced;
* an unsupported platform is dropped;
* the scenario is no longer valid.

Obsolete tests should not remain indefinitely merely because they still execute successfully.

---

## Test Deprecation

A test may enter a deprecated state before removal when immediate deletion would reduce traceability or when related functionality is being phased out.

Deprecation may be appropriate when:

* behavior is scheduled for removal;
* compatibility support is ending;
* replacement tests are being introduced;
* architecture migration is underway.

Deprecated tests should remain clearly identifiable.

---

## Test Removal

A test may be removed when its validation responsibility no longer exists or has been replaced.

Removal requires confidence that:

* protected behavior no longer exists; or
* equivalent or stronger validation exists elsewhere; or
* testing strategy has intentionally changed.

Test removal should not create an accidental validation gap.

---

## Test Removal Review

Before removing a meaningful test, engineers should ask:

* What behavior did this test protect?
* Does that behavior still exist?
* Is another test protecting it?
* Is removal associated with an intentional contract change?
* Could the removal allow a historical regression to return?

This is particularly important for regression tests.

---

## Regression Test Lifecycle

Regression tests have special lifecycle importance.

A regression test documents a previously observed defect.

Conceptually:

```text
Defect
   │
   ▼
Fix
   │
   ▼
Regression Test
   │
   ▼
Permanent Protection
```

Regression tests should normally remain active while the affected behavior remains supported.

---

## Removing Regression Tests

A regression test should only be removed when the underlying behavior is no longer relevant or when equivalent protection is demonstrably provided elsewhere.

Historical context should be preserved when useful.

---

## Test Debt

Testing debt represents weaknesses in the validation system that have accumulated over time.

Examples include:

* missing tests;
* weak assertions;
* outdated fixtures;
* skipped tests;
* flaky tests;
* excessive execution time;
* duplicated tests;
* incomplete coverage;
* obsolete test infrastructure.

Testing debt should be treated as engineering debt.

---

## Test Debt Visibility

Testing debt must remain visible.

It should not be hidden by:

* permanent skips;
* repeated retries;
* broad quarantine;
* disabled CI stages;
* undocumented exceptions.

Invisible testing debt is particularly dangerous because it creates false confidence.

---

## Test Debt Prioritization

Not all testing debt has equal risk.

Prioritization should consider:

```text
Impact
+
Likelihood
+
Affected Scope
+
Validation Gap
=
Testing Debt Priority
```

Critical validation gaps should receive higher priority than minor test-maintenance improvements.

---

## Test Debt Reduction

Testing debt reduction may include:

* adding missing tests;
* repairing flaky tests;
* removing obsolete tests;
* simplifying fixtures;
* improving execution time;
* restoring disabled validation;
* increasing contract coverage.

Debt reduction should be continuous rather than postponed indefinitely.

---

## Flaky Test Governance

Flaky tests require explicit governance.

A flaky test damages trust in the complete testing system.

The lifecycle should be:

```text
Flakiness Detected
        │
        ▼
Recorded
        │
        ▼
Investigated
        │
        ▼
Fixed
        │
        ▼
Validated
        │
        ▼
Restored
```

---

## Flaky Test Ownership

Every known flaky test should have an identifiable responsible area.

Unowned flakiness tends to persist.

---

## Flaky Test Priority

Flaky tests protecting critical behavior should receive high remediation priority.

The cost of a flaky test includes:

* false failures;
* repeated CI runs;
* lost developer time;
* reduced confidence;
* increased temptation to ignore real failures.

---

## Quarantine Governance

Quarantine is a temporary mechanism for isolating unstable tests.

It must be governed.

Every quarantine entry should have:

* test identity;
* reason;
* owner;
* date introduced;
* remediation expectation.

---

## Quarantine Lifecycle

A quarantine lifecycle should follow:

```text
Instability Identified
        │
        ▼
Temporary Quarantine
        │
        ▼
Investigation
        │
        ▼
Repair
        │
        ▼
Validation
        │
        ▼
Quarantine Removal
```

Quarantine must not become a permanent test state.

---

## Quarantine Review

Quarantined tests should be reviewed periodically.

Review should identify:

* age;
* current relevance;
* remediation progress;
* associated risk;
* whether replacement validation exists.

Long-lived quarantine indicates unresolved testing debt.

---

## Skipped Test Governance

Skipped tests also require lifecycle management.

A skip should have a meaningful reason.

Examples include:

* unsupported platform;
* optional capability unavailable;
* temporarily unavailable integration.

Temporary skips should include a path toward resolution.

---

## Permanent Skips

A permanent skip should be questioned.

If a test can never execute under supported conditions, it may be obsolete or incorrectly designed.

Permanent platform-specific skips may remain legitimate where clearly documented.

---

## Skip Review

Skip counts and reasons should be reviewed periodically.

A growing skip population may indicate deterioration in validation quality.

---

## Test Exception Governance

Exceptions to testing policies must remain explicit.

An exception may be necessary when:

* infrastructure is temporarily unavailable;
* an urgent production issue requires expedited handling;
* a test cannot yet run in CI;
* a migration is in progress.

Exceptions must not become informal standard practice.

---

## Exception Requirements

A testing exception should record:

* reason;
* scope;
* owner;
* approver where required;
* risk;
* expiration or remediation condition.

---

## Temporary Nature

Exceptions should normally be temporary.

Where an exception becomes permanent, the underlying policy should be reviewed rather than continuously bypassed.

---

## Emergency Changes

Emergency engineering changes may require reduced validation.

Even then:

* available testing should still execute;
* skipped validation should be explicit;
* risks should be documented;
* full follow-up validation should occur.

Emergency handling must remain governed.

---

## Testing Standards Governance

Testing standards may evolve as FamilyOS matures.

Changes to standards should consider:

* compatibility;
* migration cost;
* existing tests;
* developer experience;
* CI impact;
* plugin impact.

Standards should not change arbitrarily.

---

## Testing Policy Changes

Significant testing policy changes should be reviewed before adoption.

Examples include:

* new mandatory test categories;
* stricter gates;
* changed coverage policy;
* new performance thresholds;
* changed CI requirements;
* new quarantine rules.

Policy changes can affect large parts of the repository.

---

## Progressive Policy Introduction

New testing requirements may be introduced progressively.

For example:

```text
Policy Proposed
      │
      ▼
Measurement
      │
      ▼
Warning
      │
      ▼
Required Review
      │
      ▼
Mandatory Enforcement
```

Progressive adoption can reduce disruption while preserving strategic direction.

---

## Policy Exceptions During Migration

Framework migrations may temporarily require exceptions.

These should be:

* scoped;
* documented;
* temporary;
* tracked until migration completion.

---

## Test Architecture Governance

Changes to common test architecture require broad consideration.

This includes changes to:

* shared fixtures;
* test directory structure;
* markers;
* test utilities;
* execution configuration;
* test naming conventions.

Shared architecture affects repository-wide maintainability.

---

## Shared Fixture Governance

Shared fixtures should be introduced carefully.

A shared fixture can create broad coupling.

Before introducing one, engineers should consider:

* actual reuse;
* lifecycle cost;
* isolation impact;
* ownership;
* compatibility.

Local fixtures should remain preferred when reuse does not justify global scope.

---

## Test Utility Governance

Shared test utilities should provide stable value across multiple test areas.

They should not become uncontrolled collections of unrelated helper functions.

Utilities should have:

* clear purpose;
* ownership;
* tests where appropriate;
* stable interfaces.

---

## Test Data Governance

Test data should remain controlled.

Governance should ensure:

* production secrets are excluded;
* personal production data is not used casually;
* fixtures remain deterministic;
* generated data remains understandable;
* large datasets are justified.

---

## Test Configuration Governance

Test configuration should be version-controlled where practical.

Configuration changes may affect:

* test discovery;
* execution;
* warnings;
* markers;
* plugins;
* parallel behavior.

Such changes require review.

---

## CI Governance

CI testing configuration is part of testing governance.

Changes to:

* mandatory jobs;
* execution profiles;
* matrices;
* test selection;
* reporting;
* caching;
* gate behavior

should be reviewed as engineering infrastructure changes.

---

## Testing Gate Governance

Testing gates are governed according to:

```text
18-Testing-Gates.md
```

Gate changes should be deliberate because they determine whether engineering progression is permitted.

---

## Gate Policy Review

Testing gate policies should be reviewed periodically to ensure they remain:

* useful;
* reliable;
* proportionate;
* aligned with current architecture.

A gate that no longer reflects meaningful risk should be revised.

---

## Coverage Governance

Coverage expectations should evolve according to engineering needs.

Coverage policy may consider:

* criticality;
* component maturity;
* historical risk;
* architecture layer.

A universal numerical target may not be appropriate for all components.

---

## Performance Governance

Test performance should remain governed because slow test suites can damage the development lifecycle.

Governance should monitor:

* suite duration;
* slow tests;
* CI feedback time;
* expensive fixtures;
* scaling trends.

Performance optimizations must preserve validation quality.

---

## Documentation Governance

Testing standards and major testing architecture decisions should remain documented.

Documentation should evolve alongside implementation.

Undocumented testing policy creates inconsistent behavior.

---

## Specification Alignment

Where tests validate normative specifications, changes should remain synchronized with specification evolution.

Conceptually:

```text
Specification Change
        │
        ▼
Implementation Change
        │
        ▼
Test Change
        │
        ▼
Validation
```

Tests should not silently diverge from normative FamilyOS contracts.

---

## Plugin Governance

All official plugins should conform to the Testing Framework.

Plugin-specific testing approaches may exist where domain requirements justify them.

However, plugin-specific practices must not violate common principles such as:

* determinism;
* isolation;
* reporting;
* lifecycle governance;
* CI integration.

---

## New Plugin Lifecycle

When a new official plugin is introduced, testing should evolve alongside it.

Conceptually:

```text
Plugin Architecture
       │
       ▼
Plugin Implementation
       │
       ▼
Plugin Test Strategy
       │
       ▼
Automated Validation
       │
       ▼
Testing Gates
```

Testing must not be postponed until after plugin completion.

---

## Shared Framework Changes

Changes to shared testing infrastructure may affect all official plugins.

Such changes should receive broader review and validation than isolated plugin-local modifications.

---

## Test Framework Self-Validation

The Testing Framework itself must be validated.

Changes to testing infrastructure should include appropriate tests for:

* test helpers;
* fixtures;
* configuration;
* plugins;
* automation scripts;
* reporting logic.

Testing infrastructure is software and can contain defects.

---

## Lifecycle Traceability

Important testing lifecycle events should remain traceable when useful.

Examples include:

* introduction of critical regression tests;
* quarantine decisions;
* gate exceptions;
* major policy changes;
* test removals associated with contract changes.

Traceability should be proportional to engineering risk.

---

## Historical Context

Historical testing information can explain why certain tests or policies exist.

Useful historical context may include references to:

* defects;
* incidents;
* architecture decisions;
* specifications;
* migrations.

Tests should remain understandable even when the original author is no longer involved.

---

## Test Naming and Lifecycle

Stable test naming improves historical analysis.

Unnecessary renaming can make:

* failure history;
* flaky-test tracking;
* performance tracking

more difficult.

Tests should be renamed when clarity requires it, but not arbitrarily.

---

## Ownership Changes

As repository ownership evolves, testing ownership must evolve with it.

A component transfer should include responsibility for:

* component tests;
* test fixtures;
* known testing debt;
* quarantined tests;
* testing exceptions.

---

## Framework Reviews

The Testing Framework should be reviewed periodically.

Reviews may evaluate:

* relevance of current standards;
* execution performance;
* flaky-test trends;
* quarantine status;
* testing debt;
* gate effectiveness;
* CI reliability;
* developer experience.

---

## Review Triggers

Framework review may also be triggered by major events such as:

* significant architecture change;
* new plugin ecosystem requirements;
* major CI migration;
* recurring quality incidents;
* substantial test-suite growth;
* release process evolution.

---

## Continuous Improvement

Testing governance should support continuous improvement.

The improvement cycle is:

```text
Observe
   │
   ▼
Measure
   │
   ▼
Identify Weakness
   │
   ▼
Improve
   │
   ▼
Validate
   │
   ▼
Observe Again
```

Testing quality should evolve based on evidence.

---

## Governance Metrics

Governance may use testing metrics such as:

* flaky-test count;
* quarantine age;
* skipped-test count;
* test-suite duration;
* gate failure frequency;
* testing debt;
* regression frequency;
* CI infrastructure failures.

Metrics should guide decisions rather than become objectives by themselves.

---

## Test Quality Review

Tests themselves may occasionally require quality review.

Review can identify:

* weak assertions;
* unnecessary duplication;
* excessive mocking;
* unstable fixtures;
* poor naming;
* outdated expectations.

Large test suites require maintenance just like production systems.

---

## Lifecycle Automation

Some lifecycle governance may be automated.

For example, tooling may detect:

* long-lived quarantines;
* excessive skips;
* slow-test regressions;
* unused fixtures;
* missing markers.

Automation can support governance but does not replace engineering judgment.

---

## Deprecation of Testing Infrastructure

Testing tools or infrastructure may themselves be deprecated.

Examples include:

* old test runners;
* obsolete helper libraries;
* replaced CI workflows;
* deprecated plugins.

Infrastructure deprecation should include a migration plan.

---

## Migration Strategy

Testing infrastructure migration should generally follow:

```text
Current System
      │
      ▼
New System Introduced
      │
      ▼
Parallel Validation
      │
      ▼
Migration
      │
      ▼
Old System Deprecated
      │
      ▼
Old System Removed
```

Where parallel operation is impractical, equivalent safeguards should be defined.

---

## Backward Compatibility

Testing framework changes should consider compatibility with existing repository tests.

Breaking changes may be justified, but migration impact must be understood.

---

## Governance and Developer Experience

Governance should protect quality without creating unnecessary friction.

Testing policies that are difficult to understand or execute are less likely to be followed correctly.

Good governance should provide:

* clear rules;
* predictable tooling;
* understandable failures;
* documented exceptions;
* reasonable feedback times.

---

## Governance Complexity

Governance should remain proportionate.

Too little governance creates inconsistency.

Too much governance creates bureaucracy.

The preferred model is:

```text
Minimum Necessary Process
+
Maximum Useful Clarity
+
Reliable Enforcement
```

---

## Anti-Patterns

The following governance practices are discouraged or prohibited.

### Ownerless Tests

Important tests must not become nobody's responsibility.

---

### Write Once, Ignore Forever

Tests require maintenance throughout their lifecycle.

---

### Changing Tests to Hide Defects

Tests must not be weakened merely to make implementation failures disappear.

---

### Permanent Quarantine

Quarantine must remain temporary.

---

### Unexplained Skips

Skipped tests require understandable reasons.

---

### Silent Test Removal

Meaningful tests should not be removed without understanding the protection being lost.

---

### Metrics as Targets

Test counts and coverage numbers should not become goals independent of validation quality.

---

### Policy Without Enforcement

Mandatory policies should be automated where practical.

---

### Enforcement Without Documentation

Developers must understand the policies that block progression.

---

### Permanent Exceptions

Long-lived exceptions indicate that either implementation or policy requires review.

---

### Governance Without Ownership

Policies require responsible maintainers.

---

## Relationship With Testing Principles

Governance exists to preserve the principles defined throughout the Testing Framework.

It ensures that properties such as:

* determinism;
* isolation;
* maintainability;
* observability;
* automation;
* appropriate coverage

remain true as the platform evolves.

---

## Relationship With Automation

Testing governance controls the automation model defined in:

```text
17-Automation-and-CI-Integration.md
```

Automation converts testing policy into repeatable engineering behavior.

---

## Relationship With Testing Gates

Testing gate policy is governed according to:

```text
18-Testing-Gates.md
```

Gate thresholds, exceptions, and lifecycle decisions must remain controlled.

---

## Relationship With Framework Lifecycle

This document governs tests and testing policy throughout normal engineering operation.

The lifecycle of the Testing Framework itself is defined further in:

```text
20-Framework-Lifecycle.md
```

That document defines how the overall framework is introduced, evolved, versioned, deprecated, and maintained.

---

## Relationship With Quality Governance

Testing governance operates within the broader FamilyOS Quality Framework.

Testing provides one major source of engineering evidence.

Quality governance may combine testing evidence with:

* architecture;
* security;
* documentation;
* build integrity;
* release readiness.

---

## Success Criteria

FamilyOS testing governance is considered effective when:

* every important testing area has clear ownership;
* tests remain relevant as behavior evolves;
* flaky tests are actively corrected;
* quarantine remains temporary;
* skipped tests remain visible;
* test removal does not create accidental gaps;
* testing debt can be identified and prioritized;
* testing policies are understandable;
* exceptions are explicit and traceable;
* shared testing infrastructure remains maintainable;
* plugin testing remains aligned with framework standards;
* framework changes are reviewed deliberately;
* testing quality improves over time.

---

## Final Principle

The FamilyOS testing system is a living engineering capability.

Its value depends not only on creating tests, but on maintaining the trustworthiness of those tests throughout their entire lifecycle.

The governing principle is:

> Every test must have a reason to exist, an owner while it exists, and a controlled reason when it stops existing.

Testing governance protects the integrity of the testing system.

Lifecycle management ensures that this integrity survives platform evolution.
