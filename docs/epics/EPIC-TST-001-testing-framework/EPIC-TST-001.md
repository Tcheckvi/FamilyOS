# Testing Framework

## EPIC-TST-001

### Testing Framework

### Overview

EPIC-TST-001 establishes the official **Testing Framework** for the FamilyOS engineering platform.

The framework defines how FamilyOS designs, organizes, executes, automates, observes, governs, validates, and evolves software testing across the complete engineering lifecycle.

Testing is treated as a permanent engineering capability.

It is not limited to a final verification phase performed after implementation.

The Testing Framework provides a common foundation for validating:

* FamilyOS core components;
* domain implementations;
* application services;
* runtime infrastructure;
* command-line interfaces;
* official plugins;
* capabilities;
* policies;
* rules;
* recipes;
* integrations;
* public contracts;
* generated artifacts;
* shared engineering infrastructure.

The framework establishes the architecture required to transform software behavior into trustworthy engineering evidence.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of EPIC-TST-001 is to establish a unified testing foundation that enables FamilyOS to evolve safely as the platform grows.

The framework provides the principles and mechanisms required to:

* detect defects early;
* prevent regressions;
* validate architectural boundaries;
* protect public contracts;
* verify plugin behavior;
* maintain deterministic tests;
* isolate test execution;
* automate repeatable validation;
* produce actionable testing evidence;
* enforce testing gates;
* govern testing assets;
* manage testing debt;
* validate the Testing Framework itself.

---

## Problem Statement

As FamilyOS expands, testing complexity increases.

The platform contains multiple interacting architectural layers, including:

```text
Domains
Applications
Capabilities
Plugins
Runtime
CLI
Configuration
Generation
Persistence
Integrations
Engineering Frameworks
```

Without a common Testing Framework, individual components may develop incompatible testing practices.

This can lead to:

* duplicated testing infrastructure;
* inconsistent test organization;
* unreliable tests;
* excessive mocking;
* missing integration coverage;
* weak regression protection;
* slow feedback;
* hidden flaky tests;
* unclear CI expectations;
* inconsistent testing gates;
* ungoverned test removal;
* poor testing observability.

EPIC-TST-001 addresses these risks by defining one coherent testing architecture for FamilyOS.

---

## Vision

FamilyOS should be able to change rapidly without sacrificing confidence.

Every significant engineering change should produce sufficient evidence that:

```text
Expected Behavior
        │
        ▼
Is Implemented
        │
        ▼
Is Protected
        │
        ▼
Remains Compatible
        │
        ▼
Can Progress Safely
```

The Testing Framework enables that evidence to be created consistently.

---

## Core Principle

The governing principle of EPIC-TST-001 is:

> Testing must provide trustworthy engineering evidence at the earliest responsible point in the development lifecycle.

This means FamilyOS does not optimize testing merely for:

* test count;
* coverage percentage;
* execution speed;
* CI success.

The primary objective is trustworthy validation.

---

## Strategic Objectives

EPIC-TST-001 establishes the foundation required to:

1. define official testing principles;
2. establish a common Testing Framework architecture;
3. define responsibilities for every testing level;
4. standardize test design;
5. establish deterministic execution;
6. enforce test isolation;
7. protect important contracts;
8. preserve regression protection;
9. govern test data and fixtures;
10. standardize test doubles;
11. define coverage expectations;
12. optimize execution performance;
13. establish reporting and observability;
14. integrate testing with CI;
15. introduce enforceable testing gates;
16. establish testing governance;
17. define test lifecycle management;
18. govern Testing Framework evolution;
19. establish a progressive maturity roadmap;
20. define framework validation;
21. provide implementation traceability.

---

## Scope

EPIC-TST-001 applies to testing throughout the FamilyOS engineering platform.

The scope includes:

* core platform testing;
* domain testing;
* application testing;
* service testing;
* official plugin testing;
* runtime testing;
* CLI testing;
* configuration testing;
* integration testing;
* contract testing;
* regression testing;
* test infrastructure;
* test execution;
* test reporting;
* testing observability;
* CI integration;
* testing gates;
* testing governance;
* Testing Framework lifecycle.

---

## Out of Scope

EPIC-TST-001 does not independently define:

* the complete FamilyOS Quality Framework;
* build architecture;
* release architecture;
* deployment architecture;
* security architecture;
* production observability architecture;
* domain-specific acceptance policy;
* implementation of every future testing optimization.

Those concerns belong to their respective FamilyOS frameworks.

The Testing Framework integrates with them where testing evidence is required.

---

## Testing Architecture

The FamilyOS Testing Framework follows a layered architecture.

```text
Engineering Change
        │
        ▼
Testing Strategy
        │
        ▼
Testing Levels
        │
        ▼
Test Design
        │
        ▼
Execution
        │
        ▼
Evidence
        │
        ▼
Reporting
        │
        ▼
Automation
        │
        ▼
Testing Gates
        │
        ▼
Engineering Decision
```

Governance and lifecycle management surround the complete system.

---

## Testing Levels

FamilyOS recognizes multiple complementary testing levels.

```text
Unit Testing
     │
     ▼
Integration Testing
     │
     ▼
Contract Testing
     │
     ▼
Functional Testing
     │
     ▼
System Testing
```

Regression testing may exist at any of these levels.

Performance testing introduces an additional validation dimension where execution characteristics matter.

---

## Unit Testing

Unit testing provides the fastest behavioral feedback.

Unit tests should normally:

* validate focused behavior;
* isolate unnecessary dependencies;
* execute quickly;
* remain deterministic;
* contain meaningful assertions;
* provide actionable failures.

Unit tests should not attempt to replace integration testing.

---

## Integration Testing

Integration tests validate meaningful architectural boundaries.

Examples include:

* repositories;
* adapters;
* configuration;
* plugin runtime;
* persistence;
* generation infrastructure;
* service integration.

Integration tests provide evidence that components behave correctly when connected.

---

## Functional Testing

Functional tests validate meaningful capability or workflow behavior.

They focus on externally meaningful outcomes rather than internal implementation details.

---

## System Testing

System tests validate significant FamilyOS behavior across broader platform boundaries.

Because system tests may be more expensive, they belong to appropriate execution profiles rather than necessarily every local feedback cycle.

---

## Contract Testing

Contract testing protects interfaces between independently evolving components.

This is particularly important for FamilyOS because the platform contains:

* plugins;
* capabilities;
* adapters;
* services;
* shared interfaces.

Contract tests help detect incompatible changes before they propagate through the ecosystem.

---

## Regression Testing

Regression tests preserve knowledge about previously corrected defects.

The expected lifecycle is:

```text
Defect
  │
  ▼
Reproduction
  │
  ▼
Regression Test
  │
  ▼
Correction
  │
  ▼
Permanent Protection
```

Significant defects should not be allowed to disappear from engineering memory after correction.

---

## Test Data

Testing should use controlled data.

FamilyOS favors:

* synthetic data;
* deterministic values;
* understandable fixtures;
* isolated resources.

Routine tests should not depend on uncontrolled production personal data.

---

## Fixtures

Fixtures establish controlled testing state.

Fixtures should:

* have clear responsibilities;
* use appropriate lifecycle scopes;
* avoid unnecessary coupling;
* release resources correctly;
* remain understandable.

Shared fixtures should only exist when their reuse provides meaningful value.

---

## Mocks and Test Doubles

Test doubles are useful tools but must not replace meaningful validation.

The framework recognizes:

* mocks;
* stubs;
* fakes;
* spies;
* controlled substitutes.

Test doubles should be selected according to the behavior being validated.

Over-mocking can create false confidence and should be avoided.

---

## Isolation

Tests must not rely on hidden state created by unrelated tests.

Isolation applies to:

* memory;
* filesystems;
* databases;
* environment variables;
* network resources;
* subprocesses;
* temporary directories;
* shared runtime state.

Tests should remain independently executable wherever practical.

---

## Determinism

Equivalent test conditions should produce equivalent results.

Potential sources of nondeterminism include:

* wall-clock time;
* randomness;
* concurrency;
* filesystem ordering;
* uncontrolled external services;
* shared mutable state.

These dependencies should be controlled where practical.

---

## Test Coverage

Coverage is an engineering signal.

It can help identify:

* unexecuted code;
* testing gaps;
* regression risk.

Coverage must not be interpreted as proof of correctness.

A high coverage percentage with weak assertions remains weak testing.

---

## Test Execution

Testing should support multiple execution scopes.

Examples include:

```text
Individual Test
      │
      ▼
Test File
      │
      ▼
Component Suite
      │
      ▼
Plugin Suite
      │
      ▼
Repository Suite
      │
      ▼
Release Validation
```

Developers should receive fast feedback without losing broader validation safety nets.

---

## Execution Profiles

The framework recognizes execution profiles such as:

* developer;
* pull request;
* protected branch;
* full validation;
* release.

Each profile may require different combinations of testing levels and evidence.

---

## Performance

Testing performance matters because slow feedback reduces engineering efficiency.

Optimization may include:

* targeted execution;
* fixture optimization;
* parallel execution;
* CI parallelization;
* selective execution;
* sharding where justified.

Performance optimization must not compromise test reliability.

---

## Reporting

Testing results must be understandable.

Reports should provide sufficient information to identify:

* what executed;
* what passed;
* what failed;
* what was skipped;
* how long execution took;
* why failures occurred.

Failure diagnostics should reduce the time required to understand defects.

---

## Observability

The health of the testing system should itself become observable.

Useful signals may include:

* execution duration;
* failure frequency;
* flaky tests;
* skipped tests;
* quarantined tests;
* slow tests;
* CI reliability;
* testing gate outcomes.

Testing observability should support decisions rather than produce vanity metrics.

---

## Automation

Repeatable validation should be automated where practical.

Automation may operate at:

```text
Local Development
       │
       ▼
Pull Request
       │
       ▼
Protected Branch
       │
       ▼
Scheduled Validation
       │
       ▼
Release
```

The required validation breadth increases according to lifecycle risk.

---

## Continuous Integration

CI provides the primary automated environment for repository-wide testing enforcement.

CI should provide:

* reproducible execution;
* controlled dependencies;
* visible results;
* failure propagation;
* testing evidence;
* gate integration.

Local and CI behavior should remain sufficiently aligned to allow developers to reproduce failures.

---

## Testing Gates

Testing gates convert evidence into progression decisions.

```text
Required Evidence
       │
       ▼
Testing Gate
       │
       ├── PASS
       │      │
       │      ▼
       │   Progress
       │
       └── FAIL
              │
              ▼
            Block
```

Missing required evidence must not produce a normal PASS.

---

## Gate Evidence

Testing gates may consume:

* unit test results;
* integration test results;
* regression results;
* contract results;
* coverage results;
* performance results;
* required validation artifacts.

The exact evidence depends on lifecycle stage and risk.

---

## Governance

Testing requires explicit governance.

Governance covers:

* ownership;
* policy;
* test lifecycle;
* testing debt;
* flaky tests;
* quarantine;
* skips;
* exceptions;
* test removal;
* framework evolution.

Without governance, testing infrastructure gradually degrades.

---

## Test Lifecycle

Tests are maintained engineering assets.

Their lifecycle includes:

```text
Need
 │
 ▼
Design
 │
 ▼
Implementation
 │
 ▼
Review
 │
 ▼
Execution
 │
 ▼
Maintenance
 │
 ▼
Evolution
 │
 ▼
Deprecation
 │
 ▼
Removal
```

Removal should be deliberate, particularly for regression and contract tests.

---

## Testing Debt

Testing debt includes deficiencies such as:

* missing important tests;
* obsolete tests;
* flaky tests;
* excessive test duration;
* fragile fixtures;
* weak assertions;
* excessive mocking;
* long-lived quarantine.

Testing debt should remain visible and prioritized according to risk.

---

## Flaky Tests

Flaky tests are defects in the validation system.

They should not be normalized.

Repeated reruns that eventually produce success do not restore trust.

Known flakiness should be:

* visible;
* owned;
* investigated;
* remediated.

---

## Quarantine

Quarantine may temporarily isolate an unstable test.

It must not become permanent storage for unresolved testing defects.

A quarantine should identify:

* reason;
* ownership;
* introduction context;
* remediation expectation.

---

## Testing Framework Lifecycle

The Testing Framework itself is versioned and governed.

Its lifecycle includes:

```text
Definition
    │
    ▼
Adoption
    │
    ▼
Implementation
    │
    ▼
Operation
    │
    ▼
Evolution
    │
    ▼
Deprecation / Replacement
```

Framework changes must consider compatibility and migration.

---

## Framework Maturity

The Testing Framework roadmap progresses through:

```text
Foundation
    │
    ▼
Standardization
    │
    ▼
Automation
    │
    ▼
Enforcement
    │
    ▼
Observability
    │
    ▼
Optimization
    │
    ▼
Ecosystem Scale
    │
    ▼
Quality Intelligence
```

Advanced capabilities must build upon reliable foundations.

---

## Validation

The Testing Framework must itself be validated.

The framework distinguishes:

```text
Documented
    │
    ▼
Implemented
    │
    ▼
Validated
    │
    ▼
Operational
```

These states must never be treated as equivalent.

---

## Implementation Tracking

Implementation is tracked through:

```text
23-Implementation-Checklist.md
```

The canonical status model is:

```text
[ ] Not Implemented
[~] Partially Implemented
[x] Implemented and Validated
[-] Not Applicable
```

This enables incremental adoption without misrepresenting maturity.

---

## Official Plugin Applicability

EPIC-TST-001 applies to FamilyOS official plugins.

Plugin testing may validate:

* metadata;
* capabilities;
* policies;
* rules;
* recipes;
* contributions;
* contracts;
* runtime integration.

Plugin-specific requirements may extend the framework but must remain compatible with its principles.

---

## Relationship With Engineering Foundation

The Testing Framework builds upon **EPIC-ENG-001 — Engineering Foundation**.

The Engineering Foundation establishes broader requirements for:

* repository architecture;
* development workflow;
* coding standards;
* toolchain;
* engineering governance.

EPIC-TST-001 specializes those foundations for testing.

---

## Relationship With Quality Framework

The Testing Framework contributes evidence to **EPIC-QLT-001 — Quality Framework**.

Conceptually:

```text
Testing Framework
        │
        ▼
Testing Evidence
        │
        ▼
Quality Framework
        │
        ▼
Quality Decision
```

Testing is therefore a major quality capability, but not the complete FamilyOS quality model.

---

## Relationship With Build Framework

Testing integrates with **EPIC-BLD-001 — Build Framework**.

Build outputs may require validation before they are considered suitable for downstream lifecycle stages.

---

## Relationship With Release Framework

Testing evidence contributes to **EPIC-REL-001 — Release Framework**.

Release decisions may require:

* complete test execution;
* regression evidence;
* contract validation;
* system validation;
* compatibility validation;
* testing gate success.

---

* canonical documents exist;
* required documents are substantive;
* naming is consistent;
* architecture is coherent;
* testing levels are clearly differentiated;
* test reliability requirements are defined;
* execution requirements are defined;
* reporting requirements are defined;
* automation architecture is defined;

* testing infrastructure exists;
* required tests execute;
* CI performs required validation;
* reporting operates correctly;
* gates operate where required;
* governance mechanisms are usable;
* framework requirements are validated.

---

## Risks

Key risks addressed by EPIC-TST-001 include:

| Risk                       | Framework Response         |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Regression                 | Regression testing         |
| Interface incompatibility  | Contract testing           |
| Hidden integration defects | Integration testing        |
| Test interference          | Isolation                  |
| Flaky results              | Determinism and governance |
| Slow feedback              | Execution optimization     |
| Missing evidence           | Testing gates              |
| CI drift                   | Automation standards       |
| Test degradation           | Lifecycle governance       |
| Framework drift            | Validation and versioning  |

---

## Non-Goals

EPIC-TST-001 does not attempt to maximize:

* test quantity;
* coverage percentage;
* automation complexity;
* testing tool count;
* CI job count.

The framework optimizes for reliable engineering evidence proportional to risk.

---

## Success Criteria

EPIC-TST-001 succeeds when FamilyOS has a Testing Framework that:

* is understandable;
* is architecturally coherent;
* can be implemented progressively;
* supports fast developer feedback;
* protects important behavior;
* supports official plugins;
* integrates with CI;
* produces actionable evidence;
* supports enforceable gates;
* remains governable;
* can evolve safely;
* can validate its own implementation.

---

## Current Baseline

```text
EPIC: EPIC-TST-001
Framework: Testing Framework
Version: 1.0.0

Documentation:
COMPLETED

Canonical Structure:
VERIFIED

Implementation:
PROGRESSIVE

Repository Validation:
VALIDATED

Final EPIC Validation:
VALIDATED
```

The EPIC must not be marked fully validated until the repository evidence required by `VALIDATION.md` has been collected.

---

## Final Principle

FamilyOS depends on testing to determine whether engineering changes can be trusted.

Testing itself must therefore be trustworthy.

The final principle of EPIC-TST-001 is:

> Build confidence through evidence, protect that evidence through reliable testing, and govern the testing system with the same discipline applied to production architecture.

EPIC-TST-001 establishes that discipline as a permanent FamilyOS engineering capability.
