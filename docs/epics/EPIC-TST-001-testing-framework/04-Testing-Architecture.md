# Testing Framework

## 04 Testing Architecture

### Introduction

The FamilyOS Testing Architecture defines the structural model through which software behavior is validated across the FamilyOS engineering ecosystem.

It establishes how testing responsibilities are separated, how testing levels interact, how test execution produces evidence, and how that evidence is consumed by other engineering frameworks.

The architecture exists to ensure that testing remains:

* deterministic;
* scalable;
* reproducible;
* maintainable;
* observable;
* automation-friendly;
* architecture-aware;
* evidence-driven.

The Testing Architecture is not tied to a specific testing library or continuous integration platform.

Tools implement the architecture.

They do not define it.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of the Testing Architecture is to provide a canonical structural model for FamilyOS testing.

It defines:

* testing layers;
* testing boundaries;
* test execution responsibilities;
* test environment responsibilities;
* test data responsibilities;
* test isolation;
* test discovery;
* test selection;
* test execution;
* test result normalization;
* testing evidence;
* reporting boundaries;
* automation integration;
* plugin testing integration;
* lifecycle integration;
* governance boundaries.

The architecture ensures that testing behavior remains coherent as FamilyOS grows.

---

## Architectural Objective

The primary architectural objective is:

> Provide trustworthy testing evidence through clearly separated testing levels, deterministic execution boundaries, and consistent result semantics.

Testing must answer three fundamental questions:

```text
What behavior is being validated?

Under which conditions is it being validated?

What evidence proves the result?
```

A testing system that cannot answer these questions reliably does not provide sufficient engineering confidence.

---

## Architectural Context

Testing exists inside the wider FamilyOS Engineering Platform.

Conceptually:

│       ┌────────────────┼────────────────┐                   │
│       ▼                ▼                ▼                   │
│   Test Design      Test Execution    Test Evidence          │
│       │                │                │                   │
│       └────────────────┼────────────────┘                   │
│                        ▼                                    │
│                 Lifecycle Consumers                         │
│                                                             │
│      Quality / Compliance / Build / Release / Certification │
│                                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Testing is therefore both:

* an engineering activity;
* an evidence-producing platform capability.

---

## Architectural Scope

The Testing Architecture governs the structure used to validate:

* core platform components;
* domain components;
* application services;
* runtime services;
* plugin infrastructure;
* official plugins;
* third-party plugins where supported;
* configuration behavior;
* persistence behavior;
* integrations;
* public contracts;
* compatibility behavior;
* lifecycle-critical workflows.

It does not redefine the architecture of the systems being tested.

---

## Separation Of Responsibilities

The architecture separates five primary responsibilities:

```text
Test Definition
      │
      ▼
Test Selection
      │
      ▼
Test Execution
      │
      ▼
Result Normalization
      │
      ▼
Evidence Production
```

Each responsibility has a distinct purpose.

This separation prevents testing policy, execution technology, and lifecycle decisions from becoming tightly coupled.

---

## Test Definition Layer

The Test Definition Layer describes executable validation scenarios.

A test definition identifies:

* behavior;
* input;
* setup;
* dependencies;
* action;
* expected result.

Conceptually:

```text
Test Definition
├── Identity
├── Scenario
├── Preconditions
├── Dependencies
├── Input
├── Action
└── Expectations
```

The test definition must remain understandable independently of the execution infrastructure where practical.

---

## Test Selection Layer

The Test Selection Layer determines which tests should execute for a particular validation context.

Selection may depend on:

* testing level;
* component;
* package;
* plugin;
* changed files;
* risk classification;
* lifecycle stage;
* testing profile;
* platform;
* runtime version.

Selection policy must remain explicit.

---

## Test Execution Layer

The Test Execution Layer performs the selected tests.

Its responsibilities include:

* preparing the environment;
* resolving required fixtures;
* initializing dependencies;
* executing test logic;
* capturing outcomes;
* collecting diagnostics;
* enforcing timeouts;
* performing cleanup.

The execution layer must not silently redefine test expectations.

---

## Result Normalization Layer

Different testing tools may expose different native result models.

FamilyOS requires a stable semantic layer above tool-specific output.

Conceptually:

```text
pytest
   │
   ├──────────────┐
   │              │
Other Runner      │
   │              │
   └──────┬───────┘
          ▼
 Result Normalization
          │
          ▼
 Canonical Test Result
```

This enables other FamilyOS frameworks to consume testing results without depending directly on a specific test runner.

---

## Current Canonical Result Implementation

The current Testing Framework implementation provides a concrete structured
pytest execution and normalization path.

The implemented flow is:

```text
pytest
   │
   ▼
PytestRunner
   │
   ▼
PytestExecutionResult
   │
   ▼
PytestResultNormalizer
   │
   ▼
TestExecutionResult
   │
   ▼
PytestValidationGate
   │
   ▼
GateResult
```

`PytestExecutionResult` is runner-specific structured execution state.

It records:

* pytest exit code;
* discovered test count;
* executed test count;
* passed test count;
* failed test count;
* skipped test count;
* execution error count;
* total execution duration;
* an optional diagnostic.

`PytestResultNormalizer` converts that runner-specific state into the
runner-independent `TestExecutionResult`.

The current canonical aggregate execution states are:

```text
PASSED
FAILED
ERROR
```

The normalization boundary deliberately prevents consumers such as canonical
CI validation from depending directly on pytest-specific result semantics.

The current `PytestValidationGate` consumes the canonical result and translates
its status into canonical CI gate status while preserving the native pytest
exit code and available diagnostic.

This is the current implemented result-normalization boundary.

It does not yet constitute the complete Testing Evidence model described by
the Evidence Production Layer.

In particular, the current canonical result does not yet establish a governed
evidence identity containing source revision, execution identity, environment,
effective configuration, tool version, timestamp, or artifact references.

Those concerns remain part of the subsequent Testing Evidence boundary and
must not be inferred merely from the existence of structured canonical test
results.

---

## Evidence Production Layer

Normalized test results become testing evidence.

Testing evidence may contain:

```text
Test Identity
Result
Duration
Source Revision
Environment
Configuration
Tool Version
Timestamp
Diagnostics
Artifact References
```

Evidence must remain traceable to the execution that produced it.

---

## Testing Levels Architecture

FamilyOS defines multiple testing levels.

The canonical progression is:

```text
Unit
 │
 ▼
Integration
 │
 ▼
Contract
 │
 ▼
Functional
 │
 ▼
System
```

These levels represent different scopes of confidence.

They are complementary rather than interchangeable.

---

## Unit Testing Boundary

Unit testing validates isolated behavior.

The typical unit testing boundary is:

```text
┌───────────────────────────┐
│       Unit Under Test     │
│                           │
│   Controlled Inputs       │
│          │                │
│          ▼                │
│       Behavior            │
│          │                │
│          ▼                │
│   Observable Result       │
└───────────────────────────┘
```

External dependencies should normally be absent or controlled.

Unit tests optimize for:

* speed;
* determinism;
* isolation;
* diagnostic precision.

---

## Integration Testing Boundary

Integration testing validates collaboration between real components.

Conceptually:

```text
Component A
     │
     ▼
Component B
     │
     ▼
Infrastructure Boundary
```

Integration testing may include:

* repositories;
* persistence adapters;
* configuration providers;
* runtime services;
* plugin registries;
* event infrastructure.

The relevant integration must remain real.

---

## Contract Testing Boundary

Contract testing validates agreements across architectural boundaries.

Examples include:

* APIs;
* plugin contracts;
* capability interfaces;
* manifests;
* configuration schemas;
* serialization formats;
* event contracts.

Conceptually:

```text
Provider
   │
   ▼
Contract
   │
   ▼
Consumer
```

The contract is the testing boundary.

---

## Functional Testing Boundary

Functional testing validates complete capabilities from an externally meaningful perspective.

Conceptually:

```text
Requested Capability
        │
        ▼
Application Behavior
        │
        ▼
Observable Functional Result
```

Functional testing may cross several internal components.

It should remain focused on capability behavior rather than implementation topology.

---

## System Testing Boundary

System testing validates assembled FamilyOS behavior.

The system boundary may include:

```text
CLI
 │
 ▼
Application
 │
 ▼
Runtime
 │
 ├── Plugins
 │
 ├── Configuration
 │
 ├── Persistence
 │
 └── Integrations
 │
 ▼
Observable System Result
```

System tests provide broad confidence but carry higher execution cost.

---

## Testing Pyramid

The FamilyOS Testing Architecture generally favors a testing pyramid.

```text
             System
            /      \
           /        \
        Functional
       /            \
      /   Contract   \
     /                \
    Integration
   /                  \
  /____________________\
          Unit
```

The exact proportions depend on system risk and architecture.

The principle is not numerical.

It expresses a preference for obtaining confidence from the lowest appropriate testing level.

---

## Testing Architecture Flow

The complete testing flow is:

```text
Source Revision
      │
      ▼
Testing Context
      │
      ▼
Test Selection
      │
      ▼
Environment Preparation
      │
      ▼
Test Execution
      │
      ▼
Native Results
      │
      ▼
Result Normalization
      │
      ▼
Canonical Results
      │
      ▼
Evidence Production
      │
      ▼
Testing Report
      │
      ├────────► Developer
      │
      ├────────► CI
      │
      ├────────► Quality
      │
      ├────────► Compliance
      │
      ├────────► Build
      │
      └────────► Release
```

No downstream consumer should need to reinterpret raw runner internals.

---

## Testing Context

Every governed test execution occurs within a testing context.

The context describes relevant execution conditions.

A conceptual model is:

```text
TestingContext
├── source_revision
├── testing_profile
├── environment
├── platform
├── runtime_version
├── configuration
├── selected_tests
└── execution_identity
```

Not every local test run requires every field.

Higher-assurance workflows require stronger context.

---

## Test Identity

Tests should have stable identities where they participate in governed evidence.

Identity enables:

* historical comparison;
* reporting;
* regression analysis;
* failure tracking;
* compliance evidence;
* lifecycle decisions.

A test identity should not depend unnecessarily on transient execution details.

---

## Test Suite Architecture

Tests are organized into suites.

A suite groups tests that share meaningful validation characteristics.

Examples:

```text
unit
integration
contract
functional
system
```

Additional suites may exist for:

* security;
* performance;
* migration;
* compatibility;
* plugin validation.

Suites should reflect testing semantics rather than arbitrary repository organization.

---

## Test Profile Architecture

A testing profile defines a governed set of testing expectations for a particular context.

Conceptually:

```text
Testing Profile
├── Required Suites
├── Selection Rules
├── Environment Requirements
├── Coverage Expectations
├── Timeout Policy
├── Failure Policy
└── Evidence Requirements
```

Possible future profiles may include:

```text
development
pull-request
integration
release
official-plugin
certification
```

Profiles compose testing policy.

They should not redefine individual tests.

---

## Environment Architecture

Testing environments must be explicit and reproducible where required.

The environment may include:

* operating system;
* Python version;
* runtime dependencies;
* environment variables;
* database services;
* filesystem resources;
* external services;
* plugin configuration.

Environment complexity should increase only when the testing level requires it.

---

## Environment Isolation

Testing environments should minimize interference.

Conceptually:

```text
Test Execution A ──► Environment A

Test Execution B ──► Environment B
```

rather than:

```text
Test Execution A ──┐
                   ├──► Shared Mutable Environment
Test Execution B ──┘
```

Shared infrastructure may be used when safely partitioned.

---

## Test Data Architecture

Test data is a governed input to test execution.

The architecture distinguishes:

```text
Static Test Data
Generated Test Data
Fixture Data
Synthetic Data
Migration Data
Performance Data
```

Test data must remain appropriate to the testing objective.

---

## Fixture Architecture

Fixtures provide controlled setup and reusable state.

Conceptually:

```text
Fixture Definition
       │
       ▼
Fixture Resolution
       │
       ▼
Test Environment
       │
       ▼
Test Execution
       │
       ▼
Fixture Cleanup
```

Fixture lifecycle must remain explicit.

---

## Test Double Architecture

Test doubles exist at dependency boundaries.

The canonical model is:

```text
Unit Under Test
      │
      ▼
Dependency Contract
      │
      ├── Real Implementation
      │
      ├── Fake
      │
      ├── Stub
      │
      └── Mock
```

The dependency contract remains authoritative.

A test double must not redefine the production contract.

---

## Dependency Boundary

Every external dependency used during testing should belong to one of two categories:

```text
Real Dependency
```

or:

```text
Controlled Dependency
```

Uncontrolled dependencies should be avoided in deterministic suites.

---

## Time Boundary

Time is an external dependency.

Tests requiring deterministic time behavior should interact with a controlled time abstraction where practical.

Conceptually:

```text
Test
 │
 ▼
Clock Contract
 │
 ├── System Clock
 └── Test Clock
```

This prevents arbitrary wall-clock dependence.

---

## Randomness Boundary

Randomness is also an external dependency.

A deterministic testing architecture requires reproducibility.

Conceptually:

```text
Test
 │
 ▼
Random Source
 │
 ├── Production Randomness
 └── Seeded Test Randomness
```

Failing randomized cases must be reproducible.

---

## Filesystem Boundary

Tests should access filesystem resources through controlled test locations.

```text
Test Execution
      │
      ▼
Temporary Workspace
      │
      ▼
Filesystem Behavior
```

Tests must not depend unintentionally on developer-specific filesystem state.

---

## Network Boundary

Network access must be explicit.

Testing architecture should distinguish:

```text
No-Network Tests

Controlled-Network Tests

Real-Integration Network Tests
```

Unit tests should normally belong to the first category.

---

## Database Boundary

Persistence testing requires controlled state.

Conceptually:

```text
Test
 │
 ▼
Repository / Persistence Contract
 │
 ▼
Isolated Test Database
```

The database may be:

* transactional;
* disposable;
* containerized;
* schema-isolated;
* otherwise safely partitioned.

---

## Plugin Testing Architecture

Plugins are first-class testing subjects.

Plugin testing must support several boundaries:

```text
Plugin Internal Behavior
        │
        ▼
Plugin Public Contracts
        │
        ▼
Plugin Runtime Integration
        │
        ▼
FamilyOS Platform Integration
```

These boundaries should not be collapsed into one test suite.

---

## Plugin Unit Testing

Plugin unit tests validate plugin-local behavior.

Examples include:

* policies;
* rules;
* models;
* recipes;
* capability behavior.

They should remain independent of the complete FamilyOS runtime where possible.

---

## Plugin Contract Testing

Plugin contract tests validate compatibility with FamilyOS plugin contracts.

Examples include:

* plugin metadata;
* capability declarations;
* contribution declarations;
* manifests;
* runtime interfaces.

These tests protect the platform-plugin boundary.

---

## Plugin Integration Testing

Plugin integration tests validate the plugin inside the actual FamilyOS runtime mechanisms.

Conceptually:

```text
Plugin
  │
  ▼
Plugin Registry
  │
  ▼
Runtime
  │
  ▼
Capability / Contribution Resolution
```

This verifies behavior that unit testing cannot prove.

---

## Official Plugin Testing

Official plugins may require stronger testing profiles.

An official plugin profile may require evidence from:

```text
Unit
Integration
Contract
Functional
Regression
```

and other testing categories depending on risk.

The Testing Framework defines the testing semantics.

The Plugin Compliance Framework determines whether the evidence satisfies a compliance requirement.

---

## Third-Party Plugin Testing

Future third-party plugin support should reuse the same canonical testing model.

Third-party status must not create a separate meaning for test results.

Different profiles may require different evidence.

Result semantics remain consistent.

---

## Test Discovery Architecture

Test discovery determines which executable test definitions are available.

Discovery should be:

* deterministic;
* predictable;
* inspectable.

The same repository state and configuration should produce equivalent discovery results.

---

## Test Selection Architecture

Discovery and selection are different operations.

```text
Available Tests
      │
      ▼
Discovery
      │
      ▼
Discovered Tests
      │
      ▼
Selection Policy
      │
      ▼
Selected Tests
```

This distinction enables targeted testing without changing the canonical test inventory.

---

## Change-Based Selection

FamilyOS may support change-based test selection.

Conceptually:

```text
Changed Components
       │
       ▼
Dependency Knowledge
       │
       ▼
Affected Tests
```

Change-based selection is an optimization.

It must not weaken lifecycle assurance when broader testing is required.

---

## Execution Architecture

A test execution should have an explicit lifecycle.

```text
CREATED
   │
   ▼
PREPARING
   │
   ▼
RUNNING
   │
   ▼
FINALIZING
   │
   ▼
COMPLETED
```

Failures may occur at any stage.

The result model should preserve where failure occurred when useful.

---

## Parallel Execution Architecture

Independent tests may execute concurrently.

```text
              Test Selection
                    │
          ┌─────────┼─────────┐
          ▼         ▼         ▼
       Worker A  Worker B  Worker C
          │         │         │
          └─────────┼─────────┘
                    ▼
              Result Merge
```

Parallel execution must preserve deterministic semantics.

---

## Result Architecture

A canonical test result should identify the outcome of one governed test execution.

Conceptually:

```text
TestResult
├── test_id
├── outcome
├── duration
├── diagnostics
├── execution_id
└── metadata
```

Exact schemas belong to implementation specifications.

---

## Canonical Outcomes

The architecture should distinguish at minimum between meaningful outcome classes such as:

```text
PASS
FAIL
SKIPPED
ERROR
```

Additional states may be introduced where necessary.

Tool-specific result states should map explicitly to canonical semantics.

---

## Failure Versus Error

A behavioral failure and an execution error must remain distinct.

```text
FAIL
```

means that the test executed and an expected behavior was not satisfied.

```text
ERROR
```

means that the test could not provide a valid behavioral determination because execution infrastructure or setup failed.

This distinction is essential for trustworthy evidence.

---

## Skip Semantics

A skipped test is not a passing test.

```text
SKIPPED != PASS
```

A governed testing profile must determine whether skipped tests are acceptable.

---

## Expected Failure Semantics

Expected failures require explicit representation.

They must not silently become equivalent to passing tests.

The architecture must preserve enough information for governance and reporting.

---

## Retry Architecture

Retry may produce additional executions.

Conceptually:

```text
Execution 1
   FAIL
     │
     ▼
Execution 2
   PASS
```

The evidence model must retain both results.

The final presentation may summarize them, but historical evidence must remain intact.

---

## Test Run Architecture

A test run groups executions performed under a common testing context.

Conceptually:

```text
TestRun
├── run_id
├── source_revision
├── profile
├── environment
├── started_at
├── completed_at
├── executions[]
└── summary
```

A test run is not merely a terminal output stream.

It is a governed execution record.

---

## Evidence Architecture

Testing evidence is derived from test execution.

```text
Test Definitions
      │
      ▼
Test Run
      │
      ▼
Test Results
      │
      ▼
Evidence Package
```

Evidence packages may be consumed by other FamilyOS systems.

---

## Evidence Provenance

Evidence provenance answers:

```text
Who or what produced this result?

From which source revision?

Using which environment?

Using which test framework?

Under which testing profile?
```

The required provenance strength depends on lifecycle assurance.

---

## Evidence Integrity

Testing evidence used for governed decisions must be protected against accidental ambiguity or mutation.

Higher-assurance workflows may require:

* artifact identity;
* checksums;
* immutable storage;
* signed provenance;
* trusted runners.

These mechanisms belong to later implementation and security specifications.

---

## Reporting Architecture

Reporting transforms testing evidence into useful representations.

Conceptually:

```text
Canonical Evidence
       │
       ├────────► Human Report
       │
       ├────────► Machine Report
       │
       └────────► Lifecycle Summary
```

Reporting must not alter the underlying evidence semantics.

---

## Human Reporting

Human reports should optimize for diagnosis.

They should answer:

* what failed;
* where;
* why;
* under which context;
* what evidence is available.

---

## Machine Reporting

Machine-readable reports enable automation.

Potential consumers include:

* CI pipelines;
* dashboards;
* Quality Framework;
* Plugin Compliance Framework;
* Build Framework;
* Release Framework;
* certification systems.

Machine reporting requires stable schemas.

---

## Testing Evidence Boundary

Downstream frameworks may consume testing evidence.

They must not rewrite test semantics.

Conceptually:

```text
                 Testing Framework
                       │
                       ▼
                Testing Evidence
                       │
       ┌───────────────┼───────────────┐
       ▼               ▼               ▼
    Quality        Compliance         Build
                                       │
                                       ▼
                                    Release
```

Testing remains authoritative for the meaning of testing evidence.

---

## Quality Integration

The Quality Framework evaluates broader engineering quality.

Testing provides one source of quality evidence.

The boundary is:

```text
Testing Framework
      │
      │ produces
      ▼
Testing Evidence
      │
      │ consumed by
      ▼
Quality Framework
```

Quality must not redefine how a test result was produced.

---

## Compliance Integration

The Plugin Compliance Framework may require specific testing evidence.

For example:

```text
Compliance Requirement
        │
        ▼
Required Testing Evidence
        │
        ▼
Canonical Test Results
```

Compliance determines sufficiency.

Testing determines test semantics.

---

## Build Integration

The Build Framework may require tests before producing or accepting artifacts.

Conceptually:

```text
Source
 │
 ├────► Testing
 │        │
 │        ▼
 │    Test Evidence
 │        │
 ▼        ▼
Build Decision
```

Testing does not own artifact construction.

---

## Release Integration

Release validation may require a governed testing profile.

```text
Release Candidate
       │
       ▼
Release Testing Profile
       │
       ▼
Testing Evidence
       │
       ▼
Release Gate
```

The Release Framework owns the final release decision.

---

## Certification Integration

Certification may consume high-assurance testing evidence.

Certification must not infer test success merely from the existence of a test suite.

It should consume actual evidence associated with the relevant artifact or revision.

---

## Continuous Integration Architecture

CI is an execution environment for testing policy.

It is not the source of testing policy.

Conceptually:

```text
Testing Policy
      │
      ▼
CI Configuration
      │
      ▼
Test Execution
      │
      ▼
Canonical Evidence
```

Required testing rules should remain governable independently of a specific CI vendor.

---

## Local Execution Architecture

Developers should be able to execute relevant tests locally.

```text
Developer
   │
   ▼
Local Test Command
   │
   ▼
Canonical Test Selection
   │
   ▼
Test Runner
```

Local and CI semantics should remain compatible.

---

## Command Architecture

Testing commands should provide stable entry points.

Conceptually:

```text
familyos test
familyos test unit
familyos test integration
familyos test plugin <plugin>
```

These commands are architectural examples, not an implementation commitment.

Actual CLI interfaces must be defined through the relevant specifications.

---

## Repository Architecture

Tests should be organized so that their scope is understandable.

A conceptual repository model may be:

```text
tests/
├── unit/
├── integration/
├── contract/
├── functional/
├── system/
├── fixtures/
└── support/
```

FamilyOS may use variations where repository architecture requires them.

Testing semantics are more important than exact folder names.

---

## Test Support Architecture

Reusable testing infrastructure should be separated from actual test scenarios.

Examples include:

* fixtures;
* factories;
* builders;
* fakes;
* helper assertions;
* environment utilities.

Support code must not obscure test intent.

---

## Configuration Architecture

Testing configuration should be explicit.

Possible configuration domains include:

```text
Runner Configuration
Selection Configuration
Environment Configuration
Timeout Configuration
Coverage Configuration
Reporting Configuration
Parallelization Configuration
```

Configuration precedence must remain predictable.

---

## Testing Policy Architecture

Testing policy defines requirements.

Execution implements those requirements.

```text
Policy
  │
  ▼
Profile
  │
  ▼
Selection
  │
  ▼
Execution
```

This separation allows policy evolution without embedding governance directly into runner code.

---

## Gate Architecture

Testing gates evaluate evidence against lifecycle requirements.

Conceptually:

```text
Testing Evidence
       +
Testing Policy
       +
Lifecycle Context
       │
       ▼
Testing Gate
       │
       ├── PASS
       └── BLOCK
```

Gate behavior must remain deterministic where inputs are deterministic.

---

## Missing Evidence

Missing evidence must be represented explicitly.

```text
Required Evidence
       │
       ▼
Evidence Available?
       │
    ┌──┴──┐
   YES    NO
    │      │
    ▼      ▼
Evaluate  Missing Evidence
```

Missing evidence must never automatically become `PASS`.

---

## Exception Architecture

Governed exceptions exist outside normal test result semantics.

Conceptually:

```text
Requirement
    │
    ▼
Testing Evidence
    │
    ▼
Unsatisfied Requirement
    │
    ├────────► BLOCK
    │
    └────────► Approved Exception
```

An exception does not change the historical test result.

---

## Observability Architecture

The testing system itself must be observable.

Useful operational information includes:

* run duration;
* queue duration;
* test duration;
* failure rates;
* flaky behavior;
* infrastructure errors;
* worker utilization;
* retry frequency.

Observability supports testing-system improvement.

---

## Performance Architecture

Test execution performance should be measurable.

A conceptual model is:

```text
Suite Duration
├── Setup Cost
├── Execution Cost
├── Dependency Cost
├── Synchronization Cost
└── Cleanup Cost
```

Performance problems should be diagnosable rather than accepted as unexplained suite growth.

---

## Failure Diagnostics Architecture

Failure diagnostics should preserve relevant information.

Possible diagnostic elements include:

```text
Test Identity
Failure Category
Expected Value
Observed Value
Stack Trace
Captured Logs
Environment Information
Related Artifact
```

Sensitive information must be filtered appropriately.

---

## Security Boundary

Testing infrastructure interacts with potentially sensitive resources.

Security controls may apply to:

* credentials;
* secrets;
* external services;
* test artifacts;
* logs;
* CI runners;
* plugin execution.

Testing infrastructure must follow the FamilyOS Security Architecture.

---

## Trust Boundary

Not all test evidence has equal trust.

For example:

```text
Developer Local Run
       │
       ▼
Standard CI Run
       │
       ▼
Protected Release Runner
       │
       ▼
Certification Environment
```

The same test semantics may exist across all environments while evidence assurance differs.

Trust level must not redefine behavioral outcome.

---

## Artifact Binding

High-assurance testing evidence may need to bind explicitly to an artifact.

Conceptually:

```text
Artifact
   │
   ├── Identity
   ├── Version
   └── Digest
        │
        ▼
Testing Evidence
```

This prevents evidence from one artifact being incorrectly applied to another.

---

## Architecture Extensibility

The Testing Architecture must support future testing capabilities without breaking its fundamental boundaries.

Possible future extensions include:

* property-based testing;
* mutation testing;
* fuzz testing;
* performance testing;
* resilience testing;
* security testing;
* compatibility matrices;
* distributed system testing;
* hardware-dependent testing.

Extensions should integrate through governed testing semantics.

---

## Architecture Evolution

The architecture should evolve through controlled changes.

Changes affecting fundamental semantics may require:

* documentation revision;
* architecture decision;
* specification update;
* migration guidance;
* compatibility analysis.

Testing infrastructure should not evolve through accidental tool configuration drift.

---

## Architecture Invariants

The FamilyOS Testing Architecture establishes the following invariants:

1. Testing policy and test execution remain separate concerns.
2. Test discovery and test selection remain distinguishable.
3. Testing levels retain distinct semantic responsibilities.
4. Higher testing levels do not replace lower appropriate levels.
5. Test execution produces traceable results.
6. Tool-specific results may be normalized without changing their meaning.
7. A behavioral failure remains distinct from an infrastructure error.
8. A skipped test is never equivalent to a passing test.
9. Missing required evidence is never equivalent to successful evidence.
10. Retries never erase previous execution evidence.
11. Testing evidence remains associated with its execution context.
12. Local and CI execution preserve compatible semantics.
13. Test doubles do not redefine production contracts.
14. External dependencies are explicit.
15. Plugin testing follows the canonical testing architecture.
16. Official plugin status does not redefine test result semantics.
17. Quality consumes testing evidence without owning test semantics.
18. Compliance consumes testing evidence without owning test semantics.
19. Build consumes testing evidence without owning test semantics.
20. Release consumes testing evidence without owning test semantics.
21. Certification may require stronger provenance without changing test semantics.
22. CI implements testing policy but does not become its authoritative definition.
23. Exceptions never rewrite historical testing evidence.
24. Testing evidence used at high-assurance boundaries may require artifact binding.
25. Testing architecture remains independent from individual testing vendors and tools.

## Architectural Responsibility Matrix

The principal responsibility boundaries are:

| Concern                  | Testing Framework       | External Consumer               |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Test definition          | Owns                    | Does not redefine               |
| Testing levels           | Owns                    | Consumes                        |
| Test execution semantics | Owns                    | Consumes                        |
| Result semantics         | Owns                    | Consumes                        |
| Testing evidence         | Produces                | Consumes                        |
| Quality evaluation       | Supplies evidence       | Quality owns                    |
| Plugin compliance        | Supplies evidence       | Compliance owns                 |
| Artifact construction    | Supplies evidence       | Build owns                      |
| Release decision         | Supplies evidence       | Release owns                    |
| Certification decision   | Supplies evidence       | Certification governance owns   |
| Security policy          | Applies requirements    | Security Architecture owns      |
| Documentation governance | Documents testing model | Documentation Framework governs |

This matrix prevents authority from becoming ambiguous.

---

## Reference Execution Architecture

The reference logical execution architecture is:

```text
                         Source Revision
                               │
                               ▼
                        Testing Context
                               │
                               ▼
                        Testing Profile
                               │
                               ▼
                         Test Discovery
                               │
                               ▼
                         Test Selection
                               │

                  Quality   Compliance    Build      Release
```

This architecture represents the target logical separation.

Implementation may evolve while preserving these boundaries.

---

## Architectural Maturity

The Testing Architecture should progress through controlled maturity stages.

```text
Documented
    │
    ▼
Structured
    │
    ▼
Standardized
    │
    ▼
Automated
    │
    ▼
Evidence-Producing
    │
    ▼
Lifecycle-Integrated
    │
    ▼
Continuously Governed
```

The documentation baseline establishes the architectural model.

Operational maturity is achieved through implementation.

---

## Relationship With Testing Principles

`03-Testing-Principles.md` defines the principles governing testing behavior.

This document defines the architecture used to realize those principles.

The relationship is:

```text
Testing Principles
        │
        ▼
Testing Architecture
        │
        ▼
Testing Levels
        │
        ▼
Testing Implementation
```

Architecture must remain consistent with the principles.

---

## Relationship With Testing Levels

`05-Testing-Levels.md` defines the detailed semantic responsibilities of each testing level.

This architecture establishes where those levels exist in the overall testing system.

Testing-level rules must remain compatible with the architectural boundaries defined here.

---

## Relationship With Test Execution

Later framework documents define detailed execution requirements including:

* isolation;
* determinism;
* test data;
* fixtures;
* test doubles;
* coverage;
* execution performance;
* reporting;
* CI automation;
* testing gates.

Those documents refine this architecture.

They must not contradict its core responsibility boundaries.

---

## Architectural Success Criteria

The Testing Architecture is successful when:

* developers understand which testing level should validate a behavior;
* test execution remains reproducible;
* tests can run locally and in CI with compatible semantics;
* infrastructure failures are distinguishable from behavioral failures;
* test evidence is traceable;
* plugin testing follows consistent architecture;
* test results can be consumed by Quality and Compliance;
* Build and Release can consume testing evidence without understanding runner internals;
* testing tools can evolve without redefining testing semantics;
* stronger assurance can be introduced without replacing the fundamental testing model.

---

## Final Architecture Statement

The FamilyOS Testing Architecture establishes testing as a structured evidence-producing engineering capability.

Its canonical flow is:

```text
Behavior
   │
   ▼
Appropriate Testing Level
   │
   ▼
Controlled Execution
   │
   ▼
Canonical Result
   │
   ▼
Traceable Evidence
   │
   ▼
Engineering Confidence
```

The architecture deliberately separates test semantics, execution technology, evidence, and lifecycle decisions.

This separation allows FamilyOS testing to remain deterministic, scalable, governable, and trustworthy as the platform evolves.
