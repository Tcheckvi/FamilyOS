# Testing Framework

## Revision History

### Overview

This document records the revision history of the FamilyOS Testing Framework defined by EPIC-TST-001.

The revision history provides a traceable record of meaningful changes affecting:

* Testing Framework architecture;
* testing principles;
* testing levels;
* execution strategy;
* reporting;
* automation;
* testing gates;
* governance;
* lifecycle;
* validation;
* roadmap;
* implementation requirements.

Its purpose is to preserve historical context as the framework evolves.

---

## Revision Principles

Revision history entries should be created for changes that materially affect the Testing Framework.

Examples include:

* new framework capabilities;
* normative policy changes;
* architectural changes;
* new testing levels;
* modified gate requirements;
* changes to validation expectations;
* framework version changes;
* deprecations;
* compatibility changes;
* major documentation restructuring.

Minor editorial corrections do not necessarily require individual revision entries.

---

## Versioning

Testing Framework revisions should remain aligned with the broader FamilyOS versioning and documentation strategy.

Conceptually:

```text
Major Version
Breaking framework change

Minor Version
Backward-compatible framework capability

Patch Version
Correction, clarification, or non-breaking refinement
```

The exact release version associated with each revision should be recorded when applicable.

## Revision Record

### 1.0.0 — Initial Testing Framework Baseline

**Status:** Initial baseline

**EPIC:** EPIC-TST-001

**Scope:** Complete Testing Framework documentation foundation

#### Added

The initial framework baseline introduced the official FamilyOS testing architecture, including:

* Testing Framework context;
* Testing Framework vision;
* testing principles;
* testing architecture;
* testing levels;
* unit testing;
* integration testing;
* functional and system testing;
* contract testing;
* regression testing;
* test data and fixtures;
* mocks and test doubles;
* test isolation and determinism;
* test coverage;
* test execution and performance;
* test reporting and observability;
* automation and CI integration;
* testing gates;
* governance and test lifecycle;
* Testing Framework lifecycle;
* Testing Framework roadmap;

#### Documentation Structure

The canonical documentation baseline includes:

```text
00-EPIC.md
01-Context.md
02-Vision.md
03-Testing-Principles.md
04-Testing-Architecture.md
05-Testing-Levels.md

#### Architectural Decisions

The initial baseline established that:

* testing is a permanent engineering capability;
* tests must provide trustworthy evidence;
* test reliability takes precedence over execution speed;
* testing levels have distinct responsibilities;
* regression protection is part of normal engineering lifecycle;
* test isolation and determinism are mandatory objectives;
* coverage is a diagnostic signal rather than proof of correctness;
* reporting and observability are first-class testing capabilities;
* repeatable validation should be automated where practical;
* testing gates convert evidence into engineering progression decisions;
* tests and testing infrastructure require lifecycle governance;
* the Testing Framework itself has a governed lifecycle;
* framework implementation must be validated;
* future testing maturity should evolve progressively.

---

## Initial Framework Maturity

The initial Testing Framework baseline establishes the architecture required for future implementation and maturation.

The framework roadmap defines the following maturity progression:

```text
Foundation
    │
    ▼
Standardization
    │
    ▼
Automation
    │
    ▼
Enforcement
    │
    ▼
Observability
    │
    ▼
Optimization
    │
    ▼
Ecosystem Scale
    │
    ▼
Quality Intelligence
```

Not every long-term roadmap capability is required to be operational at the initial documentation baseline.

---

## Validation Baseline

The initial revision introduces an explicit framework validation model.

Validation distinguishes between:

```text
Documented
Implemented
Validated
Operational
```

The framework should not treat those states as equivalent.

---

## Implementation Tracking

The initial revision introduces:

```text
23-Implementation-Checklist.md
```

as the canonical implementation tracking mechanism.

Checklist states distinguish:

```text
[ ] Not Implemented

[~] Partially Implemented

[x] Implemented and Validated

[-] Not Applicable
```

This enables progressive framework adoption without misrepresenting future roadmap capabilities as current implementation.

---

## Governance Baseline

The initial revision establishes testing governance covering:

* framework ownership;
* component ownership;
* plugin ownership;
* testing infrastructure ownership;
* test lifecycle;
* flaky tests;
* quarantine;
* skips;
* test debt;
* testing exceptions;
* framework evolution.

Governance is intended to prevent testing degradation as FamilyOS grows.

---

## Automation Baseline

The framework defines a progressive automation architecture covering:

* local execution;
* pull request validation;
* protected branch validation;
* scheduled validation;
* release validation;
* reporting;
* required checks;
* testing gates.

Specific CI implementation remains governed by repository tooling.

---

## Testing Gate Baseline

The initial revision introduces the formal Testing Gate model.

Gate states may include:

```text
PASS
FAIL
INCOMPLETE
BLOCKED
WAIVED
```

Missing or stale evidence must never be treated as a normal pass.

---

## Plugin Testing Baseline

The Testing Framework applies to official FamilyOS plugins.

Plugin testing may include:

* capability tests;
* policy tests;
* rule tests;
* recipe tests;
* contribution tests;
* contract tests;
* runtime integration tests;
* plugin metadata validation.

Plugin-specific testing practices must remain compatible with framework-wide principles.

---

### 1.0.1 — Canonical Pytest Result Pipeline — 2026-08-24

Status: IMPLEMENTED AND VALIDATED.

This revision records the first concrete canonical Testing Framework result
pipeline implemented in FamilyOS.

The implementation introduces:

* immutable canonical aggregate test-execution result models;
* explicit aggregate `PASSED`, `FAILED`, and `ERROR` semantics;
* structured pytest-native execution results;
* normalization from pytest-specific results into runner-independent canonical
  Testing results;
* a `PytestRunnerPort` application boundary;
* subprocess-backed structured pytest execution;
* pytest hook-based collection of execution outcomes;
* deterministic consolidation of setup, call, and teardown phases;
* preservation of discovered, executed, passed, failed, skipped, and error
  counts;
* preservation of total execution duration and available diagnostics;
* canonical translation of Testing results into the CI pytest validation gate.

The runtime path is:

```text
pytest
   |
   v
PytestRunner
   |
   v
PytestExecutionResult
   |
   v
PytestResultNormalizer
   |
   v
TestExecutionResult
   |
   v
PytestValidationGate
   |
   v
GateResult
```

The canonical CI validation pipeline now consumes this Testing-owned result
boundary instead of invoking pytest through the generic subprocess validation
gate.

Validation confirmed:

* canonical result model invariants;
* pytest result normalization;
* structured passing, failing, skipped, setup-error, and teardown-error
  execution;
* preservation of pytest exit codes;
* repository-wide pytest selection;
* Testing-to-Validation gate status translation;
* CI gate ordering preservation;
* real canonical `familyos validation ci` execution;
* JSON CI output reporting the pytest gate as passed with exit code `0`;
* regression coverage across Testing, Validation, Bootstrap, and CLI CI
  validation.

This revision reconciles the Testing Architecture with the implemented
result-normalization boundary and closes only checklist requirements directly
demonstrated by the current runtime.

The following capabilities remain explicitly outside this revision:

* canonical Testing Evidence identity;
* source-revision-bound testing evidence;
* per-test canonical result identity;
* structured failure reports with assertion details and stack traces;
* governed machine-readable reporting artifacts;
* stale-evidence detection;
* gate-decision traceability;
* broader execution-profile implementation;
* full Testing Framework completion.

Framework version `1.0.0` remains unchanged.

---
## Future Revisions

Future revisions may include:

* stronger automated conformance validation;
* standardized execution profiles;
* expanded CI enforcement;
* formal test-health metrics;
* stronger flaky-test governance;
* testing dashboards;
* dependency-aware test selection;
* advanced sharding;
* compatibility matrices;
* plugin conformance suites;
* performance gates;
* quality intelligence;
* AI-assisted testing support.

These capabilities should only be promoted from roadmap objectives to normative requirements through governed framework evolution.

---

## Revision Entry Template

Future revisions should use a structure similar to:

```text
## X.Y.Z — Revision Title

Status:
Date:
Related EPIC / RFC / ADR:

### Added
...

### Changed
...

### Deprecated
...

### Removed
...

### Validation
...

### Migration
...
```

Only sections relevant to the revision need to be included.

---

## Breaking Changes

A breaking Testing Framework revision should clearly document:

* affected framework contracts;
* affected tests;
* affected CI workflows;
* affected plugins;
* compatibility implications;
* migration requirements;
* deprecation strategy;
* validation requirements.

Breaking changes should not be introduced without a migration path.

---

## Deprecated Capabilities

When a testing capability is deprecated, the revision history should identify:

* deprecated behavior;
* replacement;
* reason;
* migration expectations;
* expected removal version where known.

---

## Removed Capabilities

Removal entries should record:

* what was removed;
* why it was removed;
* which replacement exists;
* whether migration has completed.

This preserves architectural context.

---

## Relationship With Changelog

This revision history records the evolution of the Testing Framework architecture and documentation baseline.

A repository or EPIC-level `CHANGELOG.md` may provide a more concise release-oriented summary.

The two documents serve different purposes:

```text
CHANGELOG
    │
    └── Release-oriented change summary

Revision History
    │
    └── Framework evolution and architectural history
```

---

## Relationship With Framework Lifecycle

Revision history supports:

```text
20-Framework-Lifecycle.md
```

by preserving evidence of how the framework changes across versions.

---

## Relationship With Governance

Revision records support the governance requirements defined in:

```text
19-Governance-and-Test-Lifecycle.md
```

Major testing policy changes should remain historically understandable.

---

## Relationship With Validation

Framework revisions may require updated validation according to:

```text
22-Validation.md
```

A new normative requirement should normally introduce corresponding validation expectations.

---

## Relationship With Implementation Checklist

Framework revisions may require updates to:

```text
23-Implementation-Checklist.md
```

when implementation requirements change.

Checklist changes should remain synchronized with normative framework evolution.

---

## Maintenance Rules

This revision history should be updated when:

* the Testing Framework version changes;
* significant normative requirements change;
* major testing architecture changes;
* new mandatory testing capabilities are introduced;
* framework capabilities are deprecated or removed;
* a substantial migration occurs.

It should not become a detailed commit log.

---

## Historical Integrity

Existing revision records should not be rewritten merely to reflect current terminology.

Historical entries represent the framework as it existed at that point in time.

Corrections may be made where the record itself is factually incorrect, but historical meaning should be preserved.

---

## Current Baseline

The current initial baseline is:

```text
EPIC-TST-001
Testing Framework
Version 1.0.0
```

It establishes the canonical testing architecture upon which future FamilyOS testing implementation and governance can evolve.

---

## Final Principle

Revision history exists to ensure that Testing Framework evolution remains understandable.

The governing principle is:

> Change the framework deliberately, record why it changed, and preserve enough history to understand how the current testing architecture came to exist.

Testing requires traceability.

The Testing Framework requires it too.
