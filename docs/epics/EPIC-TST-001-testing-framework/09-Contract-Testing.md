# Testing Framework

## 09 Contract Testing

### Overview

Contract testing validates the explicit compatibility agreements between FamilyOS components, services, plugins, capabilities, adapters, and other architectural participants.

FamilyOS is designed as a modular and extensible platform. Components frequently evolve independently while continuing to depend on stable interfaces and behavioral expectations.

Contract testing provides automated evidence that these expectations remain compatible.

While integration testing verifies that concrete components collaborate correctly when assembled, contract testing focuses on the agreement that defines how those components are allowed to interact.

A contract may describe:

* accepted inputs;
* produced outputs;
* data structures;
* schemas;
* commands;
* events;
* capability interfaces;
* error semantics;
* lifecycle expectations;
* version compatibility;
* behavioral guarantees.

Contract testing therefore protects architectural boundaries from incompatible change.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of contract testing is to detect compatibility violations before they propagate across the FamilyOS ecosystem.

Contract testing provides confidence that:

* providers continue to satisfy consumer expectations;
* consumers use providers according to supported interfaces;
* capability interfaces remain compatible;
* plugin contributions conform to platform contracts;
* events preserve required schemas;
* adapters implement their ports correctly;
* serialized data remains compatible;
* versioned interfaces evolve safely;
* incompatible changes are detected early.

Contract testing is especially important when components have independent development or release lifecycles.

---

## Contract Definition

A contract is an explicit agreement between architectural participants.

At minimum, a contract identifies:

1. the provider;
2. the consumer or consumer class;
3. the interaction;
4. valid inputs;
5. expected outputs;
6. defined failure behavior.

A conceptual contract can be represented as:

```text
Consumer
   │
   │ Expected Interaction
   ▼
Contract
   │
   │ Required Behavior
   ▼
Provider
```

Both sides must remain compatible with the agreement.

---

## Contract Testing Principles

FamilyOS contract testing follows several fundamental principles.

### Contracts Must Be Explicit

Critical architectural expectations should not exist only as undocumented assumptions.

Contracts should be represented through appropriate artifacts such as:

* Python protocols;
* abstract interfaces;
* schemas;
* typed models;
* specifications;
* capability definitions;
* event definitions;
* plugin metadata schemas;
* repository ports.

Contract tests then provide executable validation of those definitions.

---

### Test Compatibility, Not Implementation

Contract tests must validate externally relevant behavior.

They should not depend on private implementation details.

A provider may change its internal architecture without breaking its contract.

Such changes should not require consumer contract tests to change.

---

### Protect Both Sides

Contract testing should protect providers and consumers.

Providers need confidence that changes do not break supported consumers.

Consumers need confidence that providers continue to satisfy expected behavior.

The contract becomes the stable boundary between them.

---

### Fail Early

Compatibility violations should be detected as close as possible to the change that introduces them.

Contract tests should therefore participate in development and CI workflows before complete system validation.

---

### Prefer Determinism

Contract tests must be deterministic and reproducible.

They should not depend unnecessarily on:

* public networks;
* shared environments;
* production services;
* uncontrolled data;
* execution order.

---

## Provider and Consumer Roles

Contract testing commonly distinguishes between providers and consumers.

### Provider

The provider exposes functionality or data.

Examples include:

* a repository implementation;
* a capability provider;
* a plugin;
* an event publisher;
* a service adapter;
* a runtime service.

---

### Consumer

The consumer depends on the provider's contract.

Examples include:

* application services;
* plugins;
* capability clients;
* event handlers;
* runtime components;
* CLI commands.

A single component may act as a provider in one relationship and a consumer in another.

---

## Types of Contracts

FamilyOS may define multiple categories of contracts.

These include:

* interface contracts;
* repository contracts;
* capability contracts;
* plugin contracts;
* contribution contracts;
* event contracts;
* serialization contracts;
* configuration contracts;
* service contracts;
* lifecycle contracts;
* version compatibility contracts.

Each contract type protects a different architectural boundary.

---

## Interface Contract Testing

Interface contracts define the expected behavior of implementations behind architectural abstractions.

Examples include:

```python
class FamilyRepository(Protocol):
    def save(self, family: Family) -> None:
        ...

    def get(self, family_id: FamilyId) -> Family | None:
        ...
```

Every implementation should satisfy the same observable contract.

A reusable contract suite may validate all implementations:

```python
class RepositoryContract:
    def test_saved_entity_can_be_retrieved(self, repository):
        entity = create_test_entity()

        repository.save(entity)

        assert repository.get(entity.id) == entity
```

Concrete implementations can execute the same suite.

This prevents behavioral differences between adapters that implement the same port.

---

## Repository Contract Testing

Repositories are important architectural boundaries in FamilyOS.

Repository contracts may define expectations for:

* persistence;
* retrieval;
* identity;
* updates;
* deletion;
* missing entities;
* duplicate entities;
* query behavior;
* transaction semantics;
* error behavior.

All repository implementations should satisfy the applicable repository contract suite.

This allows infrastructure implementations to change without changing application expectations.

---

## Capability Contract Testing

Capabilities expose functionality through defined platform interfaces.

Capability contracts should specify:

* capability identity;
* supported operations;
* input models;
* output models;
* validation requirements;
* error semantics;
* lifecycle expectations;
* compatibility rules.

Contract tests should verify that capability implementations conform to these definitions.

A conceptual flow is:

```text
Capability Consumer
        │
        ▼
Capability Contract
        │
        ▼
Capability Provider
```

This is particularly important when capabilities can be provided dynamically by plugins.

---

## Plugin Contract Testing

Plugins interact with the FamilyOS platform through explicit platform contracts.

Plugin contract tests may validate:

* metadata structure;
* plugin identity;
* version declaration;
* dependency declaration;
* entry points;
* capability declarations;
* contribution declarations;
* lifecycle interfaces;
* configuration contracts;
* runtime compatibility.

Official plugins must satisfy all mandatory platform contracts applicable to their plugin type.

---

## Contribution Contract Testing

Plugins may contribute artifacts such as:

* policies;
* rules;
* recipes;
* templates;
* commands;
* services;
* capabilities.

Each contribution type should have an explicit contract.

Contract tests should validate:

* required metadata;
* identifiers;
* schemas;
* supported versions;
* structural requirements;
* references;
* compatibility constraints.

Malformed contributions should fail validation before activation.

---

## Event Contract Testing

Events represent contracts between publishers and consumers.

Event contracts should define:

* event type;
* event identifier;
* schema;
* required fields;
* optional fields;
* field semantics;
* version;
* serialization rules;
* compatibility expectations.

Example:

```text
Publisher
   │
   ▼
Domain Event Contract
   │
   ▼
Event Bus
   │
   ▼
Consumer
```

Contract tests should detect changes that would make existing consumers unable to process an event.

---

## Event Schema Evolution

Event schemas require careful compatibility management.

Potential changes include:

* adding optional fields;
* adding required fields;
* removing fields;
* renaming fields;
* changing types;
* changing semantics.

Not all changes are equally safe.

For example, adding an optional field may be backward compatible, while removing a required field may break existing consumers.

Contract tests should encode the compatibility rules defined by the FamilyOS Event Architecture.

---

## Serialization Contract Testing

FamilyOS components may exchange serialized representations.

Formats may include:

* JSON;
* YAML;
* structured files;
* persisted records;
* message payloads.

Serialization contracts should validate:

* field names;
* field types;
* required fields;
* optional fields;
* default values;
* version markers;
* round-trip behavior;
* backward compatibility where required.

Example:

```python
serialized = serializer.serialize(entity)
restored = serializer.deserialize(serialized)

assert restored == entity
```

Additional tests should validate compatibility with previously supported representations where required.

---

## Configuration Contract Testing

Configuration acts as a contract between configuration producers and consuming components.

Configuration contracts may define:

* keys;
* namespaces;
* types;
* defaults;
* required values;
* validation rules;
* precedence;
* deprecation behavior.

Contract tests should ensure that configuration evolution does not silently invalidate existing supported configurations.

---

## Service Contract Testing

Application or infrastructure services may expose explicit service interfaces.

Service contracts should define:

* operations;
* inputs;
* outputs;
* error behavior;
* side effects;
* idempotency where applicable.

Contract tests should focus on these observable guarantees.

---

## Lifecycle Contract Testing

Components participating in runtime lifecycle management may expose lifecycle contracts.

These may include:

* initialize;
* start;
* ready;
* stop;
* shutdown.

Tests should validate:

* valid lifecycle transitions;
* repeated invocation behavior;
* failure semantics;
* cleanup expectations;
* resource ownership.

Lifecycle contracts are particularly important for plugins and infrastructure services.

---

## CLI Contract Testing

The CLI may expose stable user-facing contracts.

Where CLI compatibility is required, contract tests may validate:

* command names;
* option names;
* argument requirements;
* exit codes;
* machine-readable output;
* error categories.

Human-readable wording should not necessarily be treated as a strict contract unless explicitly defined as one.

Machine-consumed CLI interfaces require stronger compatibility guarantees.

---

## API Contract Testing

Where FamilyOS exposes application or network APIs, their contracts should define:

* endpoints or operations;
* request schemas;
* response schemas;
* status semantics;
* authentication requirements;
* error formats;
* versioning.

Contract tests should ensure that implementations continue to satisfy published API expectations.

---

## Consumer-Driven Contracts

Some contracts may originate from concrete consumer expectations.

In a consumer-driven approach:

1. a consumer defines the interactions it requires;
2. those expectations are represented as executable contracts;
3. the provider verifies itself against those contracts.

The conceptual model is:

```text
Consumer Expectations
          │
          ▼
   Contract Artifact
          │
          ▼
 Provider Verification
```

This approach can be valuable when multiple independently evolving consumers depend on a provider.

---

## Provider Contract Suites

FamilyOS should prefer reusable provider contract suites where multiple implementations share the same abstraction.

For example:

```text
Repository Contract Suite
        │
        ├── In-Memory Repository
        ├── SQLite Repository
        └── Future Repository Adapter
```

Every implementation executes the same behavioral expectations.

This reduces duplicated tests and prevents semantic drift.

---

## Contract Fixtures

Contract tests may require reusable fixtures that define canonical inputs and outputs.

Fixtures may include:

* valid payloads;
* invalid payloads;
* serialized representations;
* plugin metadata;
* configuration documents;
* capability requests;
* event payloads.

Contract fixtures should be:

* deterministic;
* minimal;
* version controlled;
* understandable;
* representative.

---

## Golden Contract Fixtures

For stable serialized formats, FamilyOS may use golden fixtures representing known valid contract artifacts.

For example:

```text
tests/
└── contract/
    └── fixtures/
        ├── plugin-v1.yaml
        ├── event-family-created-v1.json
        └── configuration-v1.yaml
```

Golden fixtures are useful when exact structural compatibility matters.

They should not be used indiscriminately for outputs where exact formatting is not part of the contract.

---

## Schema Validation

Machine-readable schemas should be used where appropriate.

Schema validation can detect:

* missing required fields;
* invalid types;
* unsupported values;
* malformed structures;
* unknown versions.

Schema validation alone is not always sufficient.

Behavioral contract tests may still be required to verify semantics that schemas cannot express.

---

## Contract Versioning

Contracts that evolve independently should support explicit versioning where necessary.

Versioning may apply to:

* APIs;
* events;
* capability interfaces;
* plugin metadata;
* serialized data;
* contribution formats.

A contract version should change when compatibility rules require it.

Version numbers must not be used as a substitute for documented compatibility semantics.

---

## Backward Compatibility

Backward compatibility means that newer providers continue to support valid expectations from older supported consumers.

Contract tests may verify:

```text
Current Provider
      │
      ├── Contract v1
      ├── Contract v2
      └── Contract v3
```

The exact compatibility window is defined by platform versioning and lifecycle policies.

---

## Forward Compatibility

Forward compatibility may be required for selected contracts.

Examples include consumers tolerating:

* unknown optional fields;
* newer non-breaking metadata;
* additional event information.

Forward compatibility should be intentional rather than accidental.

Tests should verify it where it forms part of the contract.

---

## Breaking Changes

A breaking change is a modification that invalidates a supported contract.

Examples may include:

* removing required operations;
* removing required fields;
* changing field types;
* changing identifiers;
* changing required semantics;
* renaming public capability operations;
* removing supported configuration keys.

Breaking changes must follow applicable FamilyOS governance and versioning rules.

They must not be introduced silently.

---

## Contract Deprecation

Contracts may evolve through controlled deprecation.

A typical lifecycle is:

```text
Supported
   │
   ▼
Deprecated
   │
   ▼
Migration Period
   │
   ▼
Removed
```

Contract tests should preserve deprecated behavior for the defined support period.

Removal should occur only when governance permits it.

---

## Negative Contract Testing

Contract suites must validate invalid behavior as well as valid behavior.

Examples include:

* malformed payloads;
* missing required fields;
* unsupported versions;
* invalid capability requests;
* incompatible plugin metadata;
* invalid event schemas;
* invalid configuration.

Providers should reject invalid interactions predictably.

---

## Error Contracts

Errors may themselves form part of an architectural contract.

Error contracts may define:

* error categories;
* typed exceptions;
* error codes;
* structured payloads;
* recoverability;
* retry semantics.

Tests should avoid depending on incidental error wording unless exact wording is explicitly part of the public contract.

---

## Contract Test Isolation

Contract tests should remain independent from one another.

Each test must establish the state required to validate its contract.

Tests should not rely on:

* execution order;
* previous test artifacts;
* shared mutable registries;
* external production state.

Contract suites should be executable repeatedly and independently.

---

## Directory Organization

Contract tests should be clearly classified.

A canonical structure is:

```text
tests/
├── unit/
├── integration/
├── functional/
├── system/
├── contract/
└── regression/
```

Contract tests may be organized by contract category:

```text
tests/contract/
├── repositories/
├── capabilities/
├── plugins/
├── contributions/
├── events/
├── serialization/
├── configuration/
├── lifecycle/
└── cli/
```

Contract fixtures may reside under:

```text
tests/contract/fixtures/
```

The exact structure may evolve while preserving clear classification.

---

## Naming Conventions

Contract tests should clearly identify the contract being protected.

Examples include:

```text
test_repository_contract_preserves_identity
test_capability_contract_rejects_invalid_input
test_plugin_metadata_contract_requires_identifier
test_event_contract_accepts_supported_version
test_configuration_contract_preserves_default_behavior
```

Reusable contract suites should also use descriptive names.

For example:

```python
class CapabilityContract:
    ...
```

or:

```python
class RepositoryContract:
    ...
```

---

## Test Markers

Contract tests may use explicit markers.

Example:

```python
@pytest.mark.contract
def test_plugin_metadata_satisfies_schema():
    ...
```

Contract suites may then be executed using:

```bash
pytest tests/contract
```

or:

```bash
pytest -m contract
```

Exact commands remain governed by the FamilyOS testing toolchain.

---

## Execution Strategy

Contract tests should execute early enough to detect compatibility problems before expensive higher-level validation.

A representative pipeline may be:

```text
Static Validation
       │
       ▼
Unit Tests
       │
       ▼
Contract Tests
       │
       ▼
Integration Tests
       │
       ▼
Functional Tests
       │
       ▼
System Tests
```

The exact ordering may vary according to dependency and execution cost.

---

## Continuous Integration

Contract tests should be integrated into FamilyOS CI.

They may run:

* during local development;
* during pull request validation;
* when public interfaces change;
* when plugin contracts change;
* during plugin certification;
* during release validation.

Contract failures affecting supported interfaces must block incompatible promotion.

---

## Change Impact Detection

Changes to contract-bearing artifacts should trigger relevant contract suites.

Examples include changes to:

* protocols;
* schemas;
* public models;
* capability definitions;
* plugin metadata schemas;
* event definitions;
* serialization models;
* configuration models.

Future FamilyOS tooling may automate contract impact analysis.

---

## Plugin Certification

Contract testing is a core component of official plugin certification.

Certification may verify:

* plugin metadata contracts;
* capability contracts;
* contribution contracts;
* lifecycle contracts;
* configuration contracts;
* runtime compatibility.

A plugin that violates mandatory platform contracts cannot be considered certified.

---

## Contract Testing and Architecture

Contract tests reinforce architectural boundaries.

They transform architectural expectations from documentation-only statements into executable constraints.

For example:

```text
Architecture Definition
        │
        ▼
Explicit Contract
        │
        ▼
Contract Test
        │
        ▼
Automated Enforcement
```

This strengthens FamilyOS architecture governance.

---

## Relationship With Unit Testing

Unit tests validate isolated behavior.

Contract tests validate boundary expectations.

A unit test may prove that a provider's implementation behaves internally as expected without proving that it remains compatible with consumers.

Both testing levels are therefore necessary.

---

## Relationship With Integration Testing

Integration testing answers:

> Do these concrete components work together?

Contract testing answers:

> Do these components satisfy the agreement that allows them to work together?

Contract tests can often detect incompatibility without assembling the complete integration environment.

This can provide faster and more precise feedback.

---

## Relationship With Functional Testing

Functional tests validate meaningful behaviors.

Contract tests validate the interfaces enabling those behaviors.

A functional test may prove that one workflow succeeds, while contract tests provide broader confidence that all supported consumers can continue using the interface correctly.

---

## Relationship With Regression Testing

Contract tests provide natural regression protection for architectural boundaries.

When a compatibility defect is discovered, the relevant contract suite should be extended so that the defect cannot silently reappear.

---

## Relationship With Versioning

Contract compatibility is closely related to versioning.

Versioning decisions should consider whether a change:

* preserves existing contracts;
* extends existing contracts compatibly;
* deprecates behavior;
* breaks supported behavior.

Contract tests provide evidence for these decisions.

---

## Contract Testing Anti-Patterns

The following practices should be avoided.

### Implicit Contracts

Relying on undocumented assumptions makes compatibility impossible to govern reliably.

---

### Testing Private Implementation

Contract tests should not encode provider internals.

---

### Overspecified Contracts

A contract that specifies irrelevant implementation details unnecessarily restricts evolution.

Only externally meaningful behavior should be protected.

---

### Schema-Only Confidence

Schema validation does not necessarily prove behavioral compatibility.

Semantic behavior may require executable tests.

---

### Ignoring Consumers

Provider-defined contracts that ignore actual consumer requirements may provide false confidence.

---

### Unversioned Breaking Changes

Breaking contract changes must never be introduced silently.

---

### Exact Error Message Coupling

Tests should not depend on incidental wording unless the wording is explicitly contractual.

---

## Performance Expectations

Contract tests should generally remain relatively fast.

They should avoid unnecessary:

* platform startup;
* external services;
* network calls;
* large databases;
* complete system environments.

Fast contract feedback allows compatibility validation to occur frequently.

---

## Reliability Requirements

Contract tests must be:

* deterministic;
* isolated;
* reproducible;
* maintainable;
* explicit;
* architecture-aware;
* version-aware.

A flaky contract test weakens confidence in compatibility guarantees and should be treated as a test defect.

---

## Quality Gates

Mandatory contract suites may participate in FamilyOS quality gates.

Potential gates include:

* public interface changes;
* plugin validation;
* plugin certification;
* protected branch validation;
* release candidate validation;
* compatibility validation.

A mandatory contract violation must block promotion until resolved or explicitly governed as a breaking change.

---

## Governance

Contract testing is governed by the FamilyOS Testing Framework and the architectural contracts defined across the platform.

Relevant governance sources include:

* Engineering Foundation;
* Testing Framework;
* Quality Framework;
* Plugin Architecture;
* API Architecture;
* Event Architecture;
* Runtime Architecture;
* Configuration Architecture;
* applicable ADRs;
* applicable RFCs;
* specifications.

Changes to critical contracts must follow the appropriate architectural governance process.

---

## Evolution Strategy

FamilyOS contract testing is expected to evolve as the ecosystem becomes more distributed and extensible.

Future improvements may include:

* automated schema compatibility analysis;
* reusable contract test libraries;
* consumer-driven contract registries;
* capability compatibility matrices;
* plugin contract certification tooling;
* event compatibility verification;
* API contract generation;
* contract change detection;
* automated semantic version recommendations;
* compatibility reports;
* historical contract fixture validation;
* cross-version certification.

Evolution should strengthen compatibility guarantees without unnecessarily restricting architectural development.

---

---

## Final Principle

Contract testing protects the agreements that allow independently evolving FamilyOS components to remain compatible.

The fundamental rule is:

> Architectural boundaries remain stable not because implementations never change, but because externally meaningful contracts are explicit, versioned when necessary, and continuously verified.

By turning architectural agreements into executable tests, FamilyOS can evolve its runtime, plugins, capabilities, events, persistence, APIs, and infrastructure while preserving compatibility across the ecosystem.
