# Testing Framework

## 23 Implementation Checklist

### Overview

The FamilyOS Testing Framework defines the architecture, principles, execution model, automation strategy, governance, lifecycle, and validation requirements for testing across the FamilyOS engineering platform.

This implementation checklist translates those framework requirements into concrete verification points.

Its purpose is to make implementation progress observable and reviewable.

The checklist must not be interpreted as a substitute for engineering judgment.

A checked item indicates that the corresponding capability has been implemented and sufficiently validated according to the applicable framework requirements.

The checklist supports:

* implementation tracking;
* framework adoption;
* repository validation;
* governance reviews;
* migration planning;
* release readiness;
* future framework evolution.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to provide the operational implementation checklist for EPIC-TST-001.

It verifies implementation across:

* framework documentation;
* testing architecture;
* test organization;
* unit testing;
* integration testing;
* functional and system testing;
* contract testing;
* regression testing;
* test data;
* fixtures;
* mocks and test doubles;
* isolation;
* determinism;
* coverage;
* test execution;
* performance;
* reporting;
* observability;
* automation;
* continuous integration;
* testing gates;
* governance;
* framework lifecycle;
* validation.

The checklist provides the final traceability layer between framework requirements and implementation evidence.

---

## Checklist Status Model

Each item may use the following states:

```text
[ ] Not Implemented

[~] Partially Implemented

[x] Implemented and Validated

[-] Not Applicable
```

A capability should only be marked `[x]` when sufficient implementation and validation evidence exists.

---

## Completion Principle

The governing checklist principle is:

> An item is complete only when the intended capability exists, is usable, and has sufficient evidence demonstrating that it behaves as required.

Documentation alone is not sufficient for implementation-oriented items.

### Canonical Pytest Result Pipeline — Implementation Evidence

Status: IMPLEMENTED AND VALIDATED.

The current Testing Framework now provides a concrete canonical pytest result
pipeline.

Implementation evidence includes:

```text
pytest
   |
   v
PytestRunner
   |
   v
PytestExecutionResult
   |
   v
PytestResultNormalizer
   |
   v
TestExecutionResult
   |
   v
PytestValidationGate
   |
   v
Canonical CI Validation
```

The implemented contracts establish:

* structured pytest execution through a Testing-owned infrastructure adapter;
* canonical runner-independent aggregate result semantics;
* explicit passed, failed, skipped, error, discovered, and executed counts;
* aggregate execution duration;
* available diagnostic propagation;
* pytest-to-canonical status normalization;
* canonical Testing-to-Validation gate translation;
* repository-wide pytest execution in canonical CI validation.

The implementation is validated by dedicated unit tests for:

* canonical result invariants;
* pytest result normalization;
* structured pytest execution;
* setup and teardown failure classification;
* skip handling;
* gate PASS, FAIL, and ERROR translation;
* repository-wide test-selection preservation.

Real canonical CI validation also confirms that the structured pytest gate
participates in the existing six-gate CI order and produces a successful
machine-facing CI gate result.

This evidence supports only the checklist items explicitly marked implemented
in the current revision.

It does not establish complete Testing Evidence, per-test structured reporting,
stale-evidence protection, full reporting observability, or completion of the
Testing Framework as a whole.

## 77. Framework Baseline Acceptance

The Testing Framework documentation baseline may be accepted when all of the following are true:

* [ ] Framework purpose is clear.
* [ ] Testing principles are explicit.
* [ ] Testing architecture is coherent.
* [ ] Testing levels are defined.
* [ ] Test design expectations are defined.
* [ ] Test execution model is defined.
* [ ] Reporting and observability are defined.
* [ ] CI integration is defined.
* [ ] Testing gates are defined.
* [ ] Governance is defined.
* [ ] Framework lifecycle is defined.
* [ ] Roadmap is defined.
* [ ] Validation requirements are defined.
* [ ] Implementation requirements are trackable.

---

## 78. Operational Acceptance

The Testing Framework implementation may be considered operational when:

* [ ] applicable framework requirements are implemented;
* [ ] core tests execute successfully;
* [ ] CI executes required validation;
* [ ] test evidence is visible;
* [ ] failures are actionable;
* [ ] testing gates operate where required;
* [ ] exceptions remain governed;
* [ ] framework validation succeeds;
* [ ] ownership exists;
* [ ] documentation matches current implementation.

---

## 79. Future Maturity Items

The following capabilities may remain future roadmap objectives until repository scale justifies them:

* [ ] advanced dependency-aware test selection;
* [ ] large-scale test sharding;
* [ ] sophisticated compatibility matrices;
* [ ] automated testing dashboards;
* [ ] predictive test prioritization;
* [ ] advanced performance gates;
* [ ] third-party plugin conformance testing;
* [ ] plugin certification suites;
* [ ] AI-assisted test analysis;
* [ ] risk-based validation orchestration.

These items should not block the initial Testing Framework baseline unless explicitly promoted to mandatory requirements.

---

## 80. Final EPIC Completion Review

Before declaring EPIC-TST-001 complete, perform a final review confirming:

```text
Documentation
     │
     ▼
Complete

Architecture
     │
     ▼
Coherent

Requirements
     │
     ▼
Traceable

Validation
     │
     ▼
Defined

Implementation
     │
     ▼
Trackable

Lifecycle
     │
     ▼
Governed
```

Final review should confirm that there are no known structural gaps that prevent the framework from serving as the official FamilyOS testing foundation.

---

## Recommended Final Validation Commands

The exact commands depend on repository tooling, but the final framework review should normally include checks equivalent to:

```bash
find docs/epics/EPIC-TST-001-testing-framework -type f | sort
```

```bash
find docs/epics/EPIC-TST-001-testing-framework -type f -empty
```

```bash
pytest
```

```bash
ruff check .
```

```bash
mypy src
```

Where repository-specific validation scripts exist, they should also be executed.

---

## Final Validation Evidence

The final EPIC completion evidence should include, where applicable:

```text
Documentation Structure
+
Non-Empty File Check
+
Test Suite Result
+
Static Analysis Result
+
Type Validation Result
+
Framework Review
=
EPIC-TST-001 Validation Evidence
```

---

## Completion Record

When the Testing Framework baseline is accepted, the project should record:

* completion state;
* relevant source revision;
* validation result;
* framework version;
* known future roadmap items;
* known accepted exceptions, if any.

This creates a stable baseline for future framework evolution.

---

## Success Criteria

This implementation checklist is effective when:

* framework requirements can be mapped to concrete implementation work;
* missing capabilities remain visible;
* partial implementation cannot be confused with completion;
* validation evidence can support checklist status;
* future roadmap items remain distinguishable from baseline requirements;
* testing governance can use the checklist during review;
* implementation progress can be measured consistently;
* EPIC completion can be demonstrated objectively.

---

## Final Principle

The Testing Framework is complete only when its architecture can be translated into real, observable engineering behavior.

The governing principle is:

> Define the requirement, implement the capability, validate the behavior, record the evidence, and only then mark the work complete.

The checklist is not the framework.

It is the final mechanism that proves the framework can move from intention to implementation.
