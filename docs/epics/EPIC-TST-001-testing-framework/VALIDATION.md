# Testing Framework

## VALIDATION

### Overview

This document records the formal validation state of **EPIC-TST-001 — Testing Framework**.

It provides the EPIC-level validation record used to determine whether the Testing Framework baseline is:

* structurally complete;
* internally coherent;
* consistent with the repository;
* aligned with its machine-readable contract;
* validated against current repository quality gates;
* suitable to remain the official FamilyOS Testing Framework baseline.

This document is intentionally distinct from:

```text
22-Validation.md
```

`22-Validation.md` defines the Testing Framework validation architecture and explains how Testing Framework capabilities should be validated.

`VALIDATION.md` records the actual validation evidence and validation state of EPIC-TST-001.

---

## EPIC Identification

```text
EPIC ID: EPIC-TST-001
Title: Testing Framework
Framework Version: 1.0.0
EPIC Status: COMPLETED
Validation Type: Framework Baseline Validation
Validation Status: VALIDATED
Historical Publication Tag: v4.2.0-testing-framework
Current Revalidation Date: 2026-08-11
```

---

## Validation Objective

The objective of this validation is to demonstrate that EPIC-TST-001 provides a complete, coherent, traceable, and repository-aligned Testing Framework baseline.

Validation covers:

* canonical structure;
* deliverable completeness;
* document presence;
* document naming;
* machine-readable metadata;
* architectural coherence;
* framework relationships;
* cross-reference integrity;
* testing-level completeness;
* roadmap completeness;
* governance completeness;
* implementation traceability;
* repository quality evidence;
* current baseline consistency.

This validation does not claim that every future capability described in the roadmap is already operational.

Roadmap capabilities remain future work until separately implemented, validated, and promoted through framework governance.

---

## Validation Principle

The governing validation principle is:

> EPIC completion must be demonstrated through objective evidence rather than inferred from documentation intent.

The required progression is:

```text
Documented
    │
    ▼
Structurally Verified
    │
    ▼
Reviewed
    │
    ▼
Repository Validated
    │
    ▼
Validated
```

EPIC-TST-001 has completed this progression.

---

## Canonical Validation Contract

The canonical Testing Framework structure is:

```text
Numbered documents: 24
Canonical range:     00-23
Control documents:   7
Canonical files:    31
```

The canonical relationship is:

```text
24 + 7 = 31
```

The machine-readable contract is maintained in:

```text
EPIC.yaml
```

The human-readable structural contract is maintained in:

```text
MANIFEST.md
```

These two files MUST agree with the repository filesystem.

---

## Validation Scope

The validation baseline includes all 31 canonical Testing Framework files.

## Validation Categories

EPIC-TST-001 validation is organized into the following categories:

```text
1. Structural Validation
2. File Completeness
3. Naming Validation
4. EPIC Contract Validation
5. Architectural Validation
6. Testing-Level Validation
7. Cross-Reference Validation
8. Governance Validation
9. Roadmap Validation
10. Implementation Traceability
11. Repository Quality Validation
12. Historical Evidence
13. Current Revalidation
14. Final Acceptance
```

---

## 1. Structural Validation

Structural validation confirms the canonical Testing Framework repository structure.

Current expected structure:

```text
24 numbered documents
7 control documents
31 canonical files
```

Validation result:

```text
VERIFIED
```

---

### Required File Validation

All 31 canonical files are present.

Result:

```text
Expected: 31
Actual:   31
Missing:  0
Unexpected canonical files: 0
```

Status:

```text
VERIFIED
```

---

### Numbered Document Validation

The numbered sequence is:

```text
00 through 23
```

Current repository result:

```text
24 numbered documents
```

First canonical numbered file:

```text
00-EPIC.md
```

Last canonical numbered file:

```text
23-Implementation-Checklist.md
```

Status:

```text
VERIFIED
```

---

### Control Document Validation

Required control documents:

```text
EPIC-TST-001.md
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

Result:

```text
7 / 7 present
```

Status:

```text
VERIFIED
```

---

## 2. File Completeness

No required canonical file is unintentionally empty.

Validation command:

```bash
find docs/epics/EPIC-TST-001-testing-framework \
  -maxdepth 1 \
  -type f \
  -empty \
  -print
```

Observed result:

```text
No files returned
```

Status:

```text
VERIFIED
```

---

## 3. Naming Validation

Canonical filenames were checked against the Testing Framework manifest.

Requirements:

* numbered filenames follow `NN-Document-Name.md`;
* numbering is continuous from `00` through `23`;
* control filenames match the canonical control set;
* no duplicate canonical numbered responsibility exists;
* no unexpected canonical filename is present.

Status:

```text
VERIFIED
```

---

## 4. EPIC Contract Validation

The original published `EPIC.yaml` contained invalid YAML syntax and an incomplete deliverable inventory.

The published file nevertheless expressed the intended state:

```text
id: EPIC-TST-001
version: 1.0.0
status: completed
```

The machine-readable contract has now been normalized.

Current validated identity:

```yaml
id: EPIC-TST-001
title: Testing Framework
version: 1.0.0
status: completed
```

Current validated structure:

```yaml
structure:
  numbered_documents: 24
  canonical_document_range: "00-23"
  control_documents: 7
  canonical_files: 31
```

Current deliverable count:

```text
31
```

Current filesystem count:

```text
31
```

Current relationship:

```text
declared deliverables = filesystem files
31 = 31
```

Status:

```text
VERIFIED
```

---

## 5. Architectural Validation

The Testing Framework defines a coherent testing architecture covering:

* testing principles;
* testing architecture;
* testing levels;
* unit testing;
* integration testing;
* functional testing;
* system testing;
* contract testing;
* regression testing;
* test data;
* fixtures;
* mocks and test doubles;
* isolation;
* determinism;
* coverage;
* execution;
* performance;
* reporting;
* observability;
* automation;
* CI integration;
* testing gates;
* governance;
* lifecycle;
* roadmap;
* validation.

Architectural responsibilities remain separated across the canonical documents.

Status:

```text
VERIFIED
```

---

## 6. Testing-Level Validation

The canonical Testing Framework defines the following testing levels:

```text
unit
integration
functional
system
contract
regression
performance
```

The framework also defines execution profiles including:

```text
developer
pull-request
protected-branch
full-validation
release
```

Testing-level responsibilities are explicit and traceable.

Status:

```text
VERIFIED
```

---

## 7. Cross-Reference Validation

Internal Testing Framework references are expected to resolve to canonical files or governed external framework references.

The canonical structure is aligned with:

* `MANIFEST.md`;
* `README.md`;
* `EPIC.yaml`;
* `EPIC-TST-001.md`;
* `CHANGELOG.md`;
* `Revision-History.md`;
* `VALIDATION.md`.

No unresolved structural reference defect has been identified during current revalidation.

Status:

```text
VERIFIED
```

---

## 8. Governance Validation

Testing Framework governance is explicitly represented through:

* testing principles;
* testing gates;
* governance and test lifecycle;
* framework lifecycle;
* implementation checklist;
* validation architecture;
* EPIC-level validation;
* machine-readable governance metadata.

`EPIC.yaml` currently defines:

```yaml
governance:
  owner: FamilyOS Engineering
  change_control: governed
  breaking_changes_require_migration: true
  exceptions_must_be_traceable: true
  deprecated_capabilities_require_replacement_guidance: true
```

Status:

```text
VERIFIED
```

---

## 9. Roadmap Validation

The Testing Framework roadmap defines progression through stages including:

```text
foundation
standardization
automation
enforcement
observability
optimization
ecosystem-scale
quality-intelligence
```

Roadmap items remain distinguishable from the current validated baseline.

Status:

```text
VERIFIED
```

---

## 10. Implementation Traceability

Implementation status is tracked through:

```text
23-Implementation-Checklist.md
```

The checklist provides capability-level implementation and validation tracking.

The Testing Framework baseline is not invalidated merely because future roadmap capabilities remain incomplete.

Current baseline implementation traceability:

```text
VERIFIED
```

---

## 11. Repository Quality Validation

The current FamilyOS repository quality gates were executed during Testing Framework revalidation.

Repository root:

```text
/Volumes/990 PRO/Project_OS/FamilyOS/familyos-cli
```

Branch:

```text
feature/foundation-engineering-docs
```

Current repository validation was performed on 2026-08-11.

---

### Ruff

Canonical command:

```bash
ruff check .
```

Current result:

```text
All checks passed!
```

Exit status:

```text
0
```

Status:

```text
PASS
```

---

### MyPy

Canonical command:

```bash
mypy src
```

Current result:

```text
Success: no issues found in 527 source files
```

Exit status:

```text
0
```

Status:

```text
PASS
```

---

### Pytest

Canonical command:

```bash
pytest -q
```

Current result:

```text
1243 passed
```

Observed execution time during revalidation:

```text
1.04s
```

Execution time is informational and may vary between runs.

Exit status:

```text
0
```

Status:

```text
PASS
```

---

### Diff Validation

Canonical command:

```bash
git diff --check
```

Observed result:

```text
PASS
```

No whitespace errors or conflict markers were reported.

Status:

```text
PASS
```

---

## 12. Historical Validation Evidence

EPIC-TST-001 was historically completed and published under:

```text
v4.2.0-testing-framework
```

The annotated tag records:

```text
EPIC-TST-001 Testing Framework completed and validated
```

Historical publication commit:

```text
05c3a6576c942745e8b6a726e8b7cad21a2a1120
```

Historical repository-quality evidence recorded in the original validation document included:

```text
Pytest:
1047 passed in 1.13s

Ruff:
All checks passed!

MyPy:
Success: no issues found in 511 source files
```

This historical evidence is preserved because it represents the repository state at the time of the original framework validation.

It MUST NOT be interpreted as the current repository test or source-file count.

---

## 13. Current Revalidation Evidence

Current revalidation performed on 2026-08-11 produced:

```text
Ruff:
PASS

MyPy:
PASS — 527 source files

Pytest:
PASS — 1243 tests

DiffCheck:
PASS
```

This demonstrates that the Testing Framework remains compatible with the current FamilyOS repository state.

Current repository validation result:

```text
VALIDATED
```

---

## Historical Versus Current Evidence

The Testing Framework now has two distinct validation evidence sets.

### Historical Publication Evidence

```text
Tag:
v4.2.0-testing-framework

Pytest:
1047 passed

MyPy:
511 source files

Ruff:
PASS
```

This evidence belongs to the historical publication baseline.

---

### Current Revalidation Evidence

```text
Date:
2026-08-11

Pytest:
1243 passed

MyPy:
527 source files

Ruff:
PASS

git diff --check:
PASS
```

This evidence represents the current repository state.

Both evidence sets are valid within their respective historical contexts.

---

## 14. Machine-Readable Baseline State

Current `EPIC.yaml` baseline state:

```yaml
baseline:
  framework_version: 1.0.0
  documentation_status: completed
  repository_validation_status: validated
  final_validation_status: validated
```

Current release metadata:

```yaml
release:
  historical_tag: v4.2.0-testing-framework
  publication_status: published
```

Status:

```text
VERIFIED
```

---

## Manifest Alignment

`MANIFEST.md` defines:

```text
Numbered documents: 24
Control documents:   7
Canonical files:    31
```

`EPIC.yaml` defines the same structure.

The repository filesystem contains the same structure.

Current relationship:

```text
MANIFEST
   =
EPIC.yaml
   =
Filesystem
```

Result:

```text
PASS
```

---

## README Alignment

`README.md` remains the primary human navigation artifact.

The README does not redefine the machine-readable structural contract.

Where future changes affect canonical inventory, README navigation MUST remain aligned with `MANIFEST.md` and `EPIC.yaml`.

Current state:

```text
VERIFIED
```

---

## CHANGELOG Alignment

`CHANGELOG.md` records the Testing Framework release-oriented history.

The historical `1.0.0` Testing Framework baseline remains valid.

The current structural normalization does not rewrite the historical release tag.

Current state:

```text
VERIFIED
```

---

## Revision History Alignment

`Revision-History.md` preserves deeper Testing Framework evolution.

Historical architecture and baseline evolution remain separate from the current machine-readable metadata correction.

Current state:

```text
VERIFIED
```

---

---

## Acceptance Criteria

The EPIC-TST-001 baseline may be declared validated when:

* all canonical documents exist;
* all seven control documents exist;
* no required document is unintentionally empty;
* canonical naming is correct;
* canonical numbering is continuous;
* architecture is internally coherent;
* testing levels are clearly defined;
* cross-references are valid;
* governance is complete;
* framework lifecycle is complete;
* roadmap is complete;
* validation architecture is complete;
* implementation requirements are traceable;
* machine-readable metadata is valid;
* `EPIC.yaml` and `MANIFEST.md` agree;
* repository validation succeeds according to applicable project policy;
* unresolved exceptions are explicitly documented.

All current baseline acceptance criteria are satisfied.

---

## Validation Failure Model

If future validation fails, the Testing Framework SHOULD classify the failure as appropriate:

```text
Documentation Defect
Structural Defect
Reference Defect
Architecture Defect
Metadata Defect
Repository Validation Failure
Governance Gap
Implementation Traceability Gap
```

The affected area SHOULD be corrected and validation repeated.

---

## Validation With Exceptions

A future baseline MAY only be marked:

```text
VALIDATED WITH DOCUMENTED EXCEPTIONS
```

when remaining exceptions:

* are explicitly identified;
* do not invalidate the framework architecture;
* have clear ownership;
* have an understood remediation path;
* are accepted according to FamilyOS governance.

Exceptions MUST NOT be hidden.

---

## Relationship With `22-Validation.md`

The distinction between the two validation documents is intentional:

```text
22-Validation.md
        │
        └── Defines Testing Framework validation architecture

VALIDATION.md
        │
        └── Records EPIC-TST-001 validation evidence and status
```

This separation prevents validation architecture from being confused with a specific validation result.

---

## Relationship With `23-Implementation-Checklist.md`

`23-Implementation-Checklist.md` tracks individual Testing Framework capabilities.

`VALIDATION.md` determines whether the EPIC baseline as a whole satisfies its acceptance requirements.

Together:

```text

---

## Final Principle

The validation record must never claim more than the available evidence proves.

The governing principle remains:

> Define the baseline, verify the repository, preserve historical evidence, record current evidence, and only then declare the framework validated.

EPIC-TST-001 satisfies this principle.
