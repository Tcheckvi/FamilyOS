# Testing Framework

## MANIFEST

### Overview

This manifest defines the canonical document set, structure, ownership expectations, validation relationships, and completeness requirements for **EPIC-TST-001 — Testing Framework**.

It is the authoritative structural inventory of the Testing Framework baseline.

The manifest exists to ensure that the EPIC remains:

* complete;
* structurally consistent;
* traceable;
* reviewable;
* governed;
* machine-readable where required;
* resistant to accidental omission, duplication, or structural drift.

The canonical Testing Framework consists of:

```text
24 numbered documents
7 control documents
31 canonical files
```

---

## EPIC Identification

```text
EPIC ID: EPIC-TST-001
Title: Testing Framework
Framework Version: 1.0.0
Status: COMPLETED
Validation Status: VALIDATED
Manifest Type: Canonical Documentation Manifest
Historical Publication Tag: v4.2.0-testing-framework
```

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this manifest is to define:

* the canonical Testing Framework document set;
* the intended order of numbered documents;
* the required control documents;
* canonical structural counts;
* document responsibilities;
* ownership expectations;
* completeness rules;
* normative hierarchy;
* lifecycle relationships;
* validation responsibilities;
* change-control expectations.

This document should be used during:

* EPIC review;
* framework validation;
* repository restructuring;
* migration;
* release preparation;
* publication verification;
* future framework revisions.

---

## Canonical Directory

The canonical directory is:

```text
docs/epics/EPIC-TST-001-testing-framework/
```

All canonical EPIC-TST-001 files MUST be maintained under this directory unless broader FamilyOS documentation governance explicitly defines otherwise.

---

## Canonical Structure Summary

The canonical Testing Framework structure is:

```text
Numbered documents: 24
Canonical range:     00-23
Control documents:   7
Canonical files:    31
```

The relationship is:

```text
24 + 7 = 31
```

This structure is authoritative for the current `1.0.0` Testing Framework baseline.

---

## Canonical Numbered Document Set

The canonical numbered Testing Framework sequence is:

```text
00-EPIC.md
01-Context.md
02-Vision.md
03-Testing-Principles.md
04-Testing-Architecture.md
05-Testing-Levels.md
06-Unit-Testing.md
07-Integration-Testing.md
08-Functional-and-System-Testing.md
09-Contract-Testing.md
10-Regression-Testing.md
11-Test-Data-and-Fixtures.md
12-Mocks-and-Test-Doubles.md
13-Test-Isolation-and-Determinism.md
14-Test-Coverage.md
15-Test-Execution-and-Performance.md
16-Test-Reporting-and-Observability.md
17-Automation-and-CI-Integration.md
18-Testing-Gates.md
19-Governance-and-Test-Lifecycle.md
20-Framework-Lifecycle.md
21-Roadmap.md
22-Validation.md
23-Implementation-Checklist.md
```

The numbered sequence defines the canonical reading and architectural progression of the framework.

---

## Canonical Control Documents

The baseline includes exactly seven control documents:

```text
EPIC-TST-001.md
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

These files are part of the canonical EPIC-TST-001 baseline.

They are not optional metadata.

Their responsibilities are distinct from the numbered framework chapters.

---

## Complete Canonical File Set

The complete canonical file inventory is:

```text
00-EPIC.md
01-Context.md
02-Vision.md
03-Testing-Principles.md
04-Testing-Architecture.md
05-Testing-Levels.md
06-Unit-Testing.md

```

Total:

```text
31 canonical files
```

## Normative Hierarchy

Where Testing Framework documents differ in abstraction level, the following hierarchy should guide interpretation:

```text
FamilyOS Engineering Foundation
        │
        ▼
FamilyOS Architecture / Governance Standards
        │
        ▼
EPIC-TST-001
        │
        ▼
Testing Principles
        │
        ▼
Testing Architecture
        │
        ▼
Testing-Level and Practice Documents
        │
        ▼
Automation / Gates / Governance
        │
        ▼
Validation Evidence
```

A more specific testing rule MAY refine a broader principle.

It MUST NOT silently contradict the broader FamilyOS engineering contract.

---

## Normative Versus Informational Content

Testing Framework documentation may contain:

* normative requirements;
* architectural guidance;
* examples;
* rationale;
* roadmap material;
* implementation guidance.

Normative statements use language such as:

```text
MUST
MUST NOT
SHOULD
SHOULD NOT
MAY
```

Examples and roadmap descriptions MUST NOT be interpreted as already implemented mandatory behavior unless explicitly promoted through framework governance.

---

## Completeness Requirements

The Testing Framework baseline is structurally complete only when:

* every canonical numbered document exists;
* every required control document exists;
* all required files are non-empty;
* document names match this manifest;
* canonical numbering is continuous;
* document responsibilities are represented;
* cross-references are coherent;
* `EPIC.yaml` agrees with the filesystem;
* no unresolved duplicate canonical files remain.

Current result:

```text
Structural Completeness: VERIFIED
```

---

## Non-Empty Requirement

No required completed canonical file may remain unintentionally empty.

Canonical validation command:

```bash
find docs/epics/EPIC-TST-001-testing-framework \
  -maxdepth 1 \
  -type f \
  -empty \
  -print
```

Expected result:

```text
No files returned
```

Current result:

```text
PASS
```

---

## Naming Requirements

Canonical filenames MUST match this manifest.

The numbered naming model is:

```text
NN-Document-Name.md
```

The control-document naming model is explicitly defined by the canonical control-document inventory.

Renaming canonical files requires coordinated updates to:

* `EPIC.yaml`;
* `MANIFEST.md`;
* `README.md`;
* internal references;
* `VALIDATION.md`;
* `CHANGELOG.md` where appropriate;
* `Revision-History.md` where appropriate.

---

## Sequence Integrity

The numbered sequence MUST remain continuous from:

```text
00
```

through:

```text
23
```

Current sequence:

```text
00-23
```

Current result:

```text
24 / 24 numbered documents present
PASS
```

Accidental duplicate numbers or missing sequence entries are structural defects.

---

## Duplicate Document Policy

Documents that duplicate canonical responsibilities SHOULD NOT remain indefinitely.

During migration, temporary duplicates MAY exist.

They MUST be:

* identifiable;
* reviewed;
* migrated;
* removed or explicitly retained.

A duplicate MUST NOT create ambiguity about which file is authoritative.

Current canonical inventory contains no unresolved duplicate numbered responsibility.

---

## Legacy File Policy

Legacy files may exist temporarily during governed restructuring.

They should be classified as:

```text
Active Canonical
Transitional
Deprecated
Obsolete
```

Obsolete files SHOULD be removed after migration and historical-preservation requirements are satisfied.

Historical information belongs in version history or revision history rather than through structurally ambiguous duplicate files.

---

## Ownership

The Testing Framework requires explicit ownership at multiple levels.

### Framework Ownership

FamilyOS Engineering owns the Testing Framework baseline.

Responsibilities include:

* canonical architecture;
* documentation coherence;
* testing principles;
* testing-level responsibilities;
* framework lifecycle;
* testing governance;
* validation expectations.

---

### Document Ownership

Each canonical document SHOULD have a clear maintenance responsibility even where explicit per-file owner metadata is not used.

---

### Implementation Ownership

Implementation teams own concrete:

* test suites;
* fixtures;
* test infrastructure;
* CI integration;
* reporting infrastructure;
* testing utilities;
* testing gates.

Implementation ownership MUST remain consistent with Testing Framework requirements.

---

## Review Responsibilities

Review of EPIC-TST-001 should confirm:

* structural completeness;
* architectural coherence;
* terminology consistency;
* correct file responsibilities;
* absence of accidental duplicates;
* current validation status;
* roadmap alignment;
* machine-readable metadata consistency;
* repository quality evidence.

---

## Validation Relationship

The manifest defines **what must exist**.

`VALIDATION.md` records **whether the baseline has been verified**.

`22-Validation.md` defines **how Testing Framework capabilities should be validated**.

`23-Implementation-Checklist.md` records **which framework capabilities have been implemented and validated**.

Conceptually:

```text
MANIFEST
   │
   ▼
Required Baseline
   │
   ▼
VALIDATION.md
   │
   ▼
Baseline Verification

22-Validation.md
   │
   ▼
Validation Architecture

23-Implementation-Checklist.md
   │
   ▼
Implementation Evidence
```

---

## EPIC Contract Relationship

`EPIC.yaml` is the machine-readable structural and lifecycle contract.

`MANIFEST.md` is the authoritative human-readable canonical inventory.

The two MUST agree on:

* EPIC identifier;
* version;
* status;
* deliverables;
* numbered-document count;
* canonical range;
* control-document count;
* canonical-file count.

Current synchronized contract:

```text
EPIC ID:              EPIC-TST-001
Version:              1.0.0
Status:               completed
Numbered documents:   24
Canonical range:      00-23
Control documents:    7
Canonical files:      31
Declared deliverables: 31
```

---

## README Relationship

`README.md` is the primary human navigation document.

`MANIFEST.md` is the authoritative structural inventory.

If the README and manifest disagree about the canonical document set, the discrepancy MUST be resolved.

---

## Changelog Relationship

`CHANGELOG.md` records meaningful framework changes.

When a change modifies:

* canonical structure;
* framework contract;
* validation state;
* publication metadata;

the changelog SHOULD record the change.

---

## Revision History Relationship

`Revision-History.md` preserves deeper architectural and structural evolution of the Testing Framework.

Canonical restructuring SHOULD be recorded when it materially changes the framework architecture or documentation model.

---

## Roadmap Relationship

Future documents or structural extensions SHOULD NOT be added merely because they appear useful.

They SHOULD correspond to:

* an identified roadmap requirement;
* a framework-evolution decision;
* a real architectural need;
* explicit governance approval.

This prevents uncontrolled documentation expansion.

---

## Framework Lifecycle Relationship

Changes to the canonical manifest are governed by:

```text
20-Framework-Lifecycle.md
```

Significant structural changes SHOULD consider:

* compatibility;
* migration;
* cross-reference updates;
* machine-readable metadata;
* release implications;
* historical traceability.

---

## Versioning

The canonical Testing Framework document version is:

```text
1.0.0
```

The historical repository publication tag is:

```text
v4.2.0-testing-framework
```

The EPIC document version and repository release tag represent distinct version identities.

Historical tags MUST remain immutable.

---

## Structural Validation Commands

Recommended validation:

```bash
EPIC_DIR="docs/epics/EPIC-TST-001-testing-framework"

printf '\n=== CANONICAL FILES ===\n'
find "$EPIC_DIR" \
  -maxdepth 1 \
  -type f \
  -exec basename {} \; \
  | sort

printf '\n=== EMPTY FILES ===\n'
find "$EPIC_DIR" \
  -maxdepth 1 \
  -type f \
  -empty \
  -print

printf '\n=== FILE COUNT ===\n'
find "$EPIC_DIR" \
  -maxdepth 1 \
  -type f \
  | wc -l

printf '\n=== NUMBERED DOCUMENTS ===\n'
find "$EPIC_DIR" \
  -maxdepth 1 \
  -type f \
  -name '[0-9][0-9]-*.md' \
  -exec basename {} \; \
  | sort
```

Expected results:

```text
Canonical files:     31
Numbered documents:  24
Control documents:    7
Empty files:           0
```

---

## Canonical Numbered File Count

The canonical numbered sequence contains:

```text
24 documents
```

covering:

```text
00 through 23
```

Any result other than 24 MUST be investigated.

---

## Control Document Count

The canonical Testing Framework defines seven required control documents:

```text
EPIC-TST-001.md
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

Control-document count:

```text
7
```

---

## Canonical File Count

The complete baseline therefore contains:

```text
24 numbered documents
+
7 control documents
=
31 canonical files
```

Current filesystem result:

```text
31 files
```

Current declared deliverables:

```text
31
```

Result:

```text
PASS
```

---

## Manifest Status

Current manifest state:

```text
Canonical Structure:
VERIFIED

Numbered Documents:
24 / 24

Control Documents:
7 / 7

Canonical Files:
31 / 31

Documentation Baseline:
COMPLETED

Repository Verification:
VALIDATED

Manifest Status:
VERIFIED
```

---

## Repository Quality Context

The Testing Framework repository has been revalidated against the current FamilyOS repository state.

Current repository evidence:

```text
Ruff:
PASS

MyPy:
PASS — 527 source files

Pytest:
PASS — 1243 tests

git diff --check:
PASS
```

Detailed validation evidence belongs in `VALIDATION.md`.

The manifest records these results only as structural validation context.

---

## Change Control

Any future modification to the canonical manifest SHOULD evaluate:

* reason for change;
* architectural impact;
* affected references;
* compatibility;
* migration requirements;
* `EPIC.yaml` updates;
* validation updates;
* changelog implications;
* release implications.

The manifest MUST NOT drift independently from the repository contract.

---

## Manifest Integrity

This file SHOULD remain focused on structural governance.

Detailed testing guidance belongs in the numbered framework chapters.

Detailed validation results belong in:

```text
VALIDATION.md
```

Detailed implementation tracking belongs in:

```text
23-Implementation-Checklist.md
```

Machine-readable structural metadata belongs in:

```text
EPIC.yaml
```

---

## Acceptance Criteria

The manifest is considered verified when:

* the repository contains all 31 declared canonical files;
* the 24 numbered documents exist;
* the numbered sequence is continuous from `00` through `23`;
* all seven control documents exist;
* required files are non-empty;
* `EPIC.yaml` and the filesystem agree;
* the manifest and machine-readable structure agree;
* no unresolved structural duplication exists;
* repository evidence has been recorded;
* the baseline remains traceable.

All current manifest acceptance criteria are satisfied.

---

## Canonical Structural Contract

The authoritative Testing Framework structure is:

```yaml
structure:
  numbered_documents: 24
  canonical_document_range: "00-23"
  control_documents: 7
  canonical_files: 31
```

The declared deliverable count is:

```text
31
```

The filesystem contains:

```text
31
```

Relationship:

```text
declared deliverables = canonical files = filesystem files
31 = 31 = 31
```

Result:

```text
PASS
```

---

## Final Principle

The Testing Framework cannot be governed reliably if its canonical structure is ambiguous.

The manifest therefore follows this principle:

> One framework must have one clearly defined canonical structure, one authoritative inventory, one machine-readable contract, and no ambiguity about what constitutes the baseline.

`MANIFEST.md` defines the human-readable structural baseline.

`EPIC.yaml` defines the corresponding machine-readable contract.

Together they establish the canonical structure of EPIC-TST-001.

---
