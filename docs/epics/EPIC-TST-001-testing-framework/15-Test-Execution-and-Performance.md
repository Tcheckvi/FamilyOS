# Testing Framework

## 15 Test Execution and Performance

### Overview

Test execution is the operational process through which the FamilyOS Testing Framework transforms test definitions into measurable evidence about the state of the platform.

A comprehensive testing strategy is not sufficient if its tests cannot be executed reliably, efficiently, repeatedly, and at the appropriate stages of the engineering lifecycle.

FamilyOS therefore treats test execution as an engineered capability.

The execution model must ensure that tests remain:

* deterministic;
* reproducible;
* observable;
* appropriately isolated;
* efficiently scheduled;
* scalable with repository growth;
* compatible with local and automated environments;
* capable of producing actionable failure information.

Performance of the test system itself is also an important engineering concern.

As the FamilyOS codebase, plugin ecosystem, specifications, integrations, and supported environments expand, uncontrolled test execution time can become a significant constraint on development velocity.

The Testing Framework therefore defines principles for balancing test coverage, confidence, execution cost, and feedback speed.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to define the official FamilyOS approach to test execution and testing performance.

It establishes expectations for:

* test execution environments;
* execution ordering;
* test isolation;
* parallel execution;
* selective execution;
* execution determinism;
* timeout management;
* resource management;
* performance monitoring;
* slow-test management;
* failure handling;
* local developer feedback;
* continuous integration execution;
* full-suite execution;
* execution optimization.

The objective is not simply to make tests run quickly.

The objective is to provide the fastest reliable feedback compatible with the level of confidence required by each engineering activity.

---

## Test Execution Principles

FamilyOS test execution follows several fundamental principles.

### Reliability Before Speed

Execution performance must never be improved by reducing test reliability.

Optimizations that introduce:

* nondeterministic behavior;
* hidden dependencies;
* execution-order dependencies;
* incomplete validation;
* race conditions;
* unstable shared resources

are unacceptable.

A slower deterministic test suite is more valuable than a faster unreliable one.

---

### Fast Feedback

Developers should receive relevant feedback as early as possible.

Tests closest to the modified behavior should generally execute before broader and more expensive validation layers.

Fast feedback reduces:

* debugging time;
* context switching;
* integration risk;
* defective commits;
* unnecessary CI consumption.

---

### Reproducibility

The same test executed against the same code, configuration, fixtures, and dependencies should produce the same result.

Execution behavior must not depend unnecessarily on:

* machine-specific state;
* previous test runs;
* test ordering;
* local user configuration;
* uncontrolled external services;
* wall-clock timing;
* network availability.

---

### Isolation

Tests should execute independently whenever technically possible.

A test must not rely on another test having executed before it.

Tests must not intentionally leave persistent state that modifies the behavior of subsequent tests.

---

### Observable Execution

Test execution must produce enough information to understand:

* what was executed;
* what passed;
* what failed;
* what was skipped;
* how long execution required;
* where failures occurred;
* whether failures indicate product defects or infrastructure problems.

---

### Proportional Execution

Not every engineering action requires execution of every test.

The scope of execution should be proportional to the risk and lifecycle stage.

A small local change may require targeted tests.

A release candidate requires significantly broader validation.

---

## Execution Model

The FamilyOS test execution model is organized around progressively broader validation scopes.

```text
Developer Change
       │
       ▼
Targeted Tests
       │
       ▼
Component / Package Tests
       │
       ▼
Relevant Integration Tests
       │
       ▼
Repository Test Suite
       │
       ▼
Extended Validation
       │
       ▼
Release Validation
```

Each stage increases confidence while generally increasing execution cost.

This layered execution model prevents expensive validation from becoming the only available feedback mechanism.

---

## Local Test Execution

Developers must be able to execute tests locally.

Local execution provides the shortest feedback loop and should be used continuously during implementation.

Typical local execution includes:

* tests for the modified module;
* tests for the modified capability;
* tests for the affected plugin;
* relevant integration tests;
* regression tests associated with the change.

Before submitting significant changes, developers should execute the broader validation required by the repository workflow.

Local execution must remain sufficiently close to automated execution to avoid situations where tests consistently pass locally but fail in CI because of unnecessary environmental differences.

---

## Targeted Test Execution

Targeted execution is the preferred mechanism during active development.

Instead of repeatedly executing the entire repository suite, developers should select the smallest meaningful test scope covering the behavior being modified.

Examples include execution by:

* test file;
* test class;
* test function;
* module;
* package;
* plugin;
* marker;
* test category.

Targeted execution accelerates the development feedback loop without replacing broader validation.

---

## Full Test Suite Execution

The complete applicable test suite provides repository-level confidence.

Full-suite execution should occur at lifecycle points where broad validation is required.

These may include:

* pull request validation;
* integration into protected branches;
* major refactoring;
* dependency upgrades;
* framework modifications;
* release preparation;
* release candidate validation.

The complete suite must remain executable as a coherent validation mechanism even when selective execution strategies are available.

---

## Test Execution Order

Tests must not depend on a specific execution order unless an exceptional test scenario explicitly requires ordered behavior.

In general:

```text
Test A ── independent
Test B ── independent
Test C ── independent
Test D ── independent
```

The following model is prohibited:

```text
Test A
  │
  ▼
creates hidden state
  │
  ▼
Test B depends on Test A
```

Order-dependent tests are fragile and interfere with:

* parallel execution;
* targeted execution;
* debugging;
* test sharding;
* reproducibility.

Where workflows require multiple sequential operations, those operations should normally be represented as steps within one coherent test scenario rather than separate tests with hidden dependencies.

---

## Deterministic Execution

Deterministic execution is a mandatory objective.

Sources of nondeterminism must be controlled whenever practical.

Common sources include:

* random values;
* timestamps;
* time zones;
* locale configuration;
* filesystem ordering;
* concurrency;
* generated identifiers;
* network behavior;
* external APIs;
* asynchronous processing.

Tests using randomness should use controlled seeds when reproducibility is required.

Time-dependent tests should use controllable time abstractions rather than relying unnecessarily on real waiting.

---

## Test Isolation

Every test should establish the state it requires.

Tests should cleanly isolate:

* filesystem state;
* database state;
* configuration;
* environment variables;
* temporary resources;
* caches;
* process state;
* external integrations.

Isolation may be implemented using:

* fixtures;
* temporary directories;
* isolated repositories;
* transaction boundaries;
* dependency substitution;
* controlled test configuration;
* disposable resources.

Shared mutable state should be avoided.

---

## Parallel Test Execution

Parallel execution may be used to reduce total test-suite duration.

However, parallelism is an optimization and must not compromise correctness.

Tests intended for parallel execution must avoid unsafe sharing of:

* files;
* ports;
* databases;
* mutable global state;
* environment variables;
* temporary directories;
* external resources.

Parallel execution should be introduced only where the suite demonstrates sufficient isolation.

---

## Test Sharding

Large test suites may be divided into independently executable groups.

```text
Complete Test Suite
        │
   ┌────┼────┬────┐
   ▼    ▼    ▼    ▼
Shard 1 Shard 2 Shard 3 Shard 4
   │    │    │    │
   └────┴────┴────┘
        │
        ▼
Aggregated Result
```

Sharding can improve CI scalability when execution capacity is available.

Shard design should seek reasonably balanced execution time rather than simply equal numbers of tests.

---

## Selective Test Execution

Selective execution reduces unnecessary validation cost by identifying tests relevant to a change.

Selection strategies may consider:

* modified files;
* affected modules;
* dependency relationships;
* plugin boundaries;
* test markers;
* architecture layers;
* historical failure relationships.

Selective execution is an optimization.

It must not eliminate mandatory full-suite validation at lifecycle stages requiring repository-wide confidence.

---

## Test Markers and Categories

Tests may be categorized to support execution policies.

Possible categories include:

```text
unit
integration
functional
system
contract
regression
slow
external
performance
```

Markers must have clearly defined semantics.

They must not become arbitrary labels used only to bypass inconvenient tests.

Execution policies should determine which categories are required for each lifecycle stage.

---

## Fast Test Suite

A fast validation suite should provide high-value feedback for normal development activities.

It should prioritize tests that:

* execute quickly;
* are highly deterministic;
* require minimal infrastructure;
* cover common behavior;
* detect common regressions.

The fast suite may include primarily unit tests and lightweight integration tests.

It should be possible to execute frequently without significantly interrupting development.

---

## Extended Test Suite

Some tests inherently require more execution time or infrastructure.

Examples may include:

* system tests;
* large integration scenarios;
* external service validation;
* migration validation;
* compatibility matrices;
* performance tests;
* long-running regression scenarios.

These tests may execute less frequently while remaining part of the overall validation strategy.

They must not simply disappear from the engineering lifecycle because they are expensive.

---

## Slow Test Management

Slow tests must be visible.

A test that becomes significantly slower over time should be investigated.

Possible causes include:

* unnecessary I/O;
* repeated initialization;
* oversized fixtures;
* excessive data generation;
* real waiting;
* uncontrolled network access;
* inefficient implementation;
* redundant test setup.

Slow tests should not automatically be removed.

The first question should be whether the execution cost can be reduced while preserving the test's validation value.

---

## Execution Time Budgets

The Testing Framework may define execution-time expectations for different validation layers.

Conceptually:

| Test Scope                | Expected Feedback      |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Individual unit test      | Immediate              |
| Targeted developer suite  | Very fast              |
| Plugin or component suite | Fast                   |
| Repository validation     | Reasonable CI feedback |
| Extended validation       | Longer-running         |
| Release validation        | Confidence prioritized |

Exact thresholds may evolve with repository size, infrastructure capacity, and platform maturity.

The important requirement is that execution duration remains measurable and governed.

---

## Performance Baselines

Test-suite performance should be evaluated against historical baselines.

Useful measurements include:

* total execution duration;
* duration by test category;
* duration by package;
* duration by plugin;
* slowest tests;
* setup duration;
* fixture initialization cost;
* CI queue time;
* parallel efficiency.

Performance regressions should be investigated when they materially affect engineering feedback loops.

---

## Test Duration Tracking

Execution duration should be observable at multiple levels.

```text
Repository
   │
   ├── Test Category
   │      ├── Unit
   │      ├── Integration
   │      └── System
   │
   ├── Plugin
   │
   └── Individual Tests
```

Tracking allows the project to identify where execution cost accumulates.

Without measurement, test-suite performance degradation can remain unnoticed until it becomes a major development constraint.

---

## Timeout Management

Tests that interact with asynchronous operations, processes, infrastructure, or external systems should use bounded execution where appropriate.

Timeouts protect the suite from indefinitely blocked execution.

Timeout values must be realistic.

A timeout should not be used to hide unreliable behavior.

Repeated timeout failures indicate that the underlying test or system behavior requires investigation.

---

## Avoiding Real Waiting

Tests should avoid real-time waiting whenever possible.

Patterns such as:

```text
sleep(...)
```

should not be used as the default mechanism for coordinating test behavior.

Preferred approaches include:

* controllable clocks;
* explicit synchronization;
* polling with bounded conditions;
* event-based coordination;
* mocked scheduling;
* deterministic asynchronous execution.

Real waiting increases suite duration and frequently introduces flaky behavior.

---

## Resource Management

Tests may consume resources such as:

* CPU;
* memory;
* disk space;
* filesystem handles;
* network ports;
* database connections;
* subprocesses.

Resource-intensive tests must manage these resources explicitly.

Tests must release resources after execution.

Resource leaks can create failures that appear unrelated to the test responsible for them.

---

## Temporary Resources

Temporary test resources should be created in isolated locations and removed automatically.

This applies particularly to:

* files;
* directories;
* databases;
* generated configuration;
* repositories;
* sockets;
* process artifacts.

Tests should use framework-provided temporary-resource mechanisms whenever available.

---

## External Dependency Execution

Tests depending on external systems require special execution policies.

External dependencies may introduce:

* network latency;
* service outages;
* rate limits;
* authentication requirements;
* changing external behavior;
* nondeterministic responses.

Normal repository validation should minimize uncontrolled external dependencies.

Tests requiring real external systems should be explicitly categorized and executed in appropriate controlled environments.

---

## CI Test Execution

Continuous integration is a primary execution environment for the FamilyOS Testing Framework.

CI execution should provide consistent validation independent of individual developer machines.

A conceptual pipeline may follow:

```text
Source Change
     │
     ▼
Static Validation
     │
     ▼
Fast Tests
     │
     ▼
Integration Tests
     │
     ▼
Broader Test Suite
     │
     ▼
Quality Gates
```

The exact pipeline may evolve, but test execution should preserve progressively increasing confidence.

---

## Fail-Fast Strategy

Fail-fast execution can reduce wasted computation when an early failure invalidates subsequent stages.

For example:

```text
Lint Failure
    │
    └── Stop

Type Validation Failure
    │
    └── Stop

Fast Test Failure
    │
    └── Stop

Integration Failure
    │
    └── Stop
```

However, fail-fast behavior must be balanced against diagnostic value.

In some contexts, executing additional independent tests after a failure may provide useful information.

The pipeline should choose the appropriate behavior according to validation cost and diagnostic needs.

---

## Failure Reproduction

CI failures must be reproducible locally whenever practical.

Failure output should provide sufficient information to identify:

* failing test;
* failure reason;
* relevant environment;
* execution parameters;
* important fixture state;
* relevant logs.

A CI-only failure that cannot be reproduced should be treated as an engineering problem requiring investigation.

---

## Retry Policy

Automatic retries must be used cautiously.

Retries can hide:

* race conditions;
* nondeterministic tests;
* infrastructure instability;
* real product defects.

A test that passes only after retrying is not equivalent to a consistently passing test.

If retries are used for infrastructure-related reasons, retry behavior must remain visible in execution results.

---

## Flaky Test Execution

Flaky tests damage confidence in the complete test system.

A flaky test is one whose result changes without a meaningful change to the code or intended environment.

Flaky tests should be:

1. identified;
2. recorded;
3. investigated;
4. corrected;
5. restored to normal execution.

Permanent acceptance of flaky tests is not compatible with the FamilyOS quality model.

---

## Quarantine

Temporary quarantine may be used when a test is known to be unstable and its instability would otherwise block unrelated development.

Quarantine must be exceptional and traceable.

A quarantined test requires:

* a documented reason;
* an owner;
* a remediation path;
* visibility in validation reporting.

Quarantine must never become a permanent alternative to repairing tests.

---

## Execution Reporting

Every significant test execution should produce a clear result.

At minimum, reporting should make visible:

```text
Executed
Passed
Failed
Skipped
Expected Failures
Unexpected Passes
Duration
```

Where relevant, reports may also include:

* test category;
* coverage information;
* retry count;
* quarantined tests;
* slowest tests;
* environment metadata.

---

## Skipped Tests

Skipped tests must remain visible.

A growing number of skipped tests may indicate:

* unsupported behavior;
* incomplete implementation;
* unavailable dependencies;
* obsolete tests;
* hidden validation gaps.

Skip reasons should therefore be explicit.

Unexplained or permanent skips should be reviewed.

---

## Performance Optimization Strategy

Test execution optimization should follow a disciplined sequence.

```text
Measure
   │
   ▼
Identify Bottleneck
   │
   ▼
Understand Cause
   │
   ▼
Optimize
   │
   ▼
Validate Reliability
   │
   ▼
Measure Again
```

Optimization should be evidence-based rather than speculative.

---

## Optimization Techniques

Appropriate optimization techniques may include:

* reducing redundant setup;
* improving fixture scopes;
* eliminating unnecessary I/O;
* replacing real waits;
* isolating expensive tests;
* parallel execution;
* test sharding;
* selective execution;
* dependency caching;
* optimized test-data generation;
* avoiding repeated environment initialization.

Every optimization must preserve test correctness and independence.

---

## Fixture Performance

Fixtures can become a major source of execution cost.

Fixture design should consider:

* initialization cost;
* reuse safety;
* isolation requirements;
* cleanup cost;
* dependency hierarchy.

Expensive fixtures should not be recreated unnecessarily.

However, unsafe fixture sharing must not be introduced solely for performance reasons.

Isolation remains the primary requirement.

---

## Test Data Performance

Large test datasets should be used only where they contribute meaningful validation value.

Most tests should use the smallest dataset capable of demonstrating the intended behavior.

Large datasets are appropriate for scenarios such as:

* scalability validation;
* migration testing;
* performance testing;
* boundary testing;
* realistic system scenarios.

Using production-scale data for ordinary unit tests creates unnecessary execution cost.

---

## Performance Tests

Performance tests evaluate characteristics of the FamilyOS platform itself rather than only the speed of the test suite.

They may evaluate:

* latency;
* throughput;
* memory consumption;
* CPU utilization;
* scalability;
* startup time;
* processing capacity.

Performance tests should be separated conceptually from normal correctness tests.

A functional test asks:

> Does the behavior produce the correct result?

A performance test asks:

> Does the behavior meet the required operational characteristics?

Both questions may be important, but they require different validation approaches.

---

## Performance Test Stability

Performance results are sensitive to execution environments.

Meaningful performance tests require controlled conditions.

Variables may include:

* hardware;
* CPU load;
* memory pressure;
* operating system;
* Python version;
* dependency versions;
* background processes;
* storage performance.

Performance comparisons should therefore avoid treating uncontrolled developer-machine measurements as authoritative benchmarks.

---

## Benchmarking

Benchmarks should measure clearly defined operations.

A useful benchmark must identify:

* the operation being measured;
* the input characteristics;
* the environment;
* the number of iterations;
* warm-up behavior where relevant;
* the metric being evaluated.

Benchmark results should be compared against meaningful baselines rather than isolated absolute numbers.

---

## Performance Regression Detection

A performance regression occurs when an operation becomes materially slower or more resource-intensive without an accepted reason.

Detection may compare:

```text
Baseline
   │
   ▼
Current Measurement
   │
   ▼
Allowed Variance
   │
   ├── Within Range → Accept
   │
   └── Outside Range → Investigate
```

Thresholds should account for normal measurement variance.

Performance gates must not be so sensitive that normal environmental noise creates constant false failures.

---

## Execution Profiles

FamilyOS may define standardized execution profiles.

For example:

### Developer Profile

Optimized for rapid local feedback.

May include:

* targeted unit tests;
* relevant integration tests;
* affected regression tests.

### Pull Request Profile

Optimized for change validation.

May include:

* unit tests;
* integration tests;
* contract tests;
* relevant functional tests;
* regression tests.

### Full Validation Profile

Optimized for repository-wide confidence.

May include all mandatory automated test categories.

### Release Profile

Optimized for release confidence.

May additionally include:

* system tests;
* compatibility tests;
* migration tests;
* extended regression tests;
* performance validation where required.

Execution profiles should be explicitly defined rather than relying on informal developer knowledge.

---

## Execution Performance and Quality Gates

Execution performance may itself become part of engineering quality governance.

Examples of possible monitored conditions include:

* repository test duration regression;
* excessive slow-test growth;
* persistent flaky tests;
* repeated timeout failures;
* excessive skipped tests;
* performance benchmark regression.

These signals should support engineering decisions rather than encouraging artificial metric optimization.

---

## Developer Experience

The test system is part of the developer experience.

A well-designed execution model should make it easy to:

* discover relevant tests;
* execute tests;
* understand failures;
* rerun failed tests;
* select test categories;
* identify slow tests;
* reproduce CI behavior.

Complex test execution procedures reduce the likelihood that tests will be used continuously during development.

The preferred interface should therefore remain simple even when the underlying testing architecture becomes sophisticated.

---

## Scaling the Test Suite

FamilyOS is expected to evolve across:

* platform capabilities;
* official plugins;
* integrations;
* specifications;
* runtime services;
* CLI functionality;
* domain models.

The test execution architecture must scale with this growth.

Scaling should rely on:

```text
Isolation
+
Categorization
+
Selective Execution
+
Parallelism
+
Sharding
+
Performance Monitoring
=
Scalable Test Execution
```

The framework must avoid reaching a state where repository validation becomes so expensive that developers routinely bypass it.

---

## Anti-Patterns

The following practices are discouraged or prohibited.

### Always Running Everything Locally

Executing the entire suite after every small modification can unnecessarily slow development.

Use targeted execution during active development and broader validation at appropriate lifecycle stages.

---

### Never Running the Full Suite

Selective testing does not eliminate the need for repository-wide validation.

---

### Hidden Test Dependencies

Tests must not rely on state produced by previously executed tests.

---

### Uncontrolled Parallelism

Increasing worker count without understanding shared resources can introduce nondeterministic failures.

---

### Permanent Retries

Retries must not become a mechanism for accepting flaky tests.

---

### Arbitrary Sleeps

Real waiting should not replace deterministic synchronization.

---

### Ignoring Slow Tests

Execution-time regressions accumulate gradually.

Slow tests must remain measurable.

---

### Disabling Tests for Speed

Performance optimization must not be achieved by silently removing required validation.

---

## Governance

Test execution policies are governed by the FamilyOS Testing Framework.

Changes affecting:

* mandatory execution profiles;
* CI test stages;
* test categorization;
* quarantine policies;
* performance thresholds;
* retry behavior;
* test parallelization;
* release validation

must preserve the principles defined by this framework.

Significant changes should be documented and reviewed through the appropriate FamilyOS engineering governance process.

---

## Relationship With Other Testing Documents

This document complements the other Testing Framework specifications.

It relies particularly on:

* testing principles;
* testing architecture;
* testing levels;
* unit testing;
* integration testing;
* functional and system testing;
* contract testing;
* regression testing;
* test data and fixtures;
* mocks and test doubles;
* test isolation and determinism;
* test automation and CI.

Together these documents define both what FamilyOS tests and how those tests are executed reliably at scale.

---

## Success Criteria

The FamilyOS test execution model is considered effective when:

* developers receive fast relevant feedback;
* tests remain deterministic;
* tests can execute independently;
* CI failures can be reproduced;
* the complete suite remains practical to execute;
* slow tests are visible;
* execution performance is measurable;
* flaky tests are actively controlled;
* parallelism does not reduce reliability;
* selective execution does not create validation gaps;
* performance regressions can be detected;
* release validation provides sufficient confidence.

---

## Final Principle

The FamilyOS Testing Framework treats test execution as part of the engineering architecture rather than as a simple command that runs tests.

The governing principle is:

> Execute the right tests, at the right time, with the highest practical reliability and the shortest responsible feedback loop.

Test performance exists to accelerate confidence.

It must never replace confidence.
