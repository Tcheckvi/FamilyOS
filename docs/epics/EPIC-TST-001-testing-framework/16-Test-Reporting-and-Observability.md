# Testing Framework

## 16 Test Reporting and Observability

### Overview

Test execution produces evidence about the state of the FamilyOS platform.

That evidence becomes useful only when it can be understood, analyzed, retained, and connected to engineering decisions.

The FamilyOS Testing Framework therefore treats test reporting and test observability as first-class engineering capabilities.

A test result must provide more information than a binary pass or fail status.

The testing system should make it possible to understand:

* what was tested;
* what was not tested;
* what passed;
* what failed;
* why a failure occurred;
* where the failure occurred;
* how long execution required;
* which environment was used;
* whether failures are deterministic;
* whether test health is improving or degrading;
* whether validation provides sufficient confidence for the current lifecycle stage.

Test reporting communicates execution outcomes.

Test observability provides the broader information necessary to understand the behavior and health of the testing system over time.

Together they transform individual test executions into actionable engineering evidence.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to define the official FamilyOS approach to test reporting and observability.

It establishes expectations for:

* test result reporting;
* execution summaries;
* failure diagnostics;
* test logs;
* execution metadata;
* test artifacts;
* historical test information;
* test-health metrics;
* flaky-test visibility;
* skipped-test visibility;
* performance visibility;
* CI reporting;
* quality-gate integration;
* trend analysis;
* test dashboards;
* reporting governance.

The objective is to ensure that testing information remains understandable and actionable throughout the FamilyOS engineering lifecycle.

---

## Reporting Principles

FamilyOS test reporting follows several fundamental principles.

### Clarity

Reports must clearly communicate the outcome of test execution.

Developers should not need to inspect large quantities of unrelated output to determine whether validation succeeded.

---

### Actionability

Failure information must help engineers identify the next debugging action.

A report that only states that something failed provides insufficient diagnostic value.

---

### Traceability

Test results should be traceable to the execution context that produced them.

Relevant context may include:

* source revision;
* branch;
* test environment;
* dependency versions;
* execution profile;
* configuration;
* platform;
* runtime version.

---

### Visibility

Important testing conditions must remain visible.

This includes:

* failures;
* skips;
* quarantined tests;
* retries;
* flaky tests;
* slow tests;
* incomplete execution.

---

### Consistency

Reporting conventions should remain consistent across test categories and execution environments.

Developers should not need to learn a completely different reporting model for every FamilyOS subsystem.

---

### Proportionality

Reporting detail should match the execution context.

Local targeted execution may require concise terminal output.

Release validation may require detailed persistent reports and artifacts.

---

## Reporting Model

The FamilyOS test reporting model can be represented as:

```text
Test Execution
      │
      ▼
Raw Test Results
      │
      ▼
Structured Reporting
      │
      ├── Summary
      ├── Failures
      ├── Timing
      ├── Metadata
      ├── Logs
      └── Artifacts
      │
      ▼
Observability Layer
      │
      ├── Metrics
      ├── Trends
      ├── Test Health
      └── Quality Signals
      │
      ▼
Engineering Decisions
```

Reporting therefore acts as the bridge between test execution and engineering governance.

---

## Test Result States

The testing system should distinguish meaningful result states.

Typical states include:

```text
Passed
Failed
Skipped
Expected Failure
Unexpected Pass
Error
Timeout
Quarantined
```

The exact terminology may depend on the test tooling, but the semantic distinction must remain understandable.

A test that was not executed successfully must not be represented as equivalent to a passing test.

---

## Execution Summary

Every significant test execution should produce a concise summary.

At minimum, the summary should communicate:

* total tests discovered;
* tests executed;
* tests passed;
* tests failed;
* tests skipped;
* execution errors;
* total duration.

Where applicable, it should also report:

* expected failures;
* unexpected passes;
* retries;
* quarantined tests;
* warnings;
* coverage results.

A developer should be able to understand the overall execution state from the summary alone.

---

## Failure Reporting

Failure reporting is one of the most important responsibilities of the testing system.

A useful failure report should identify:

* failing test;
* test location;
* failing assertion;
* expected behavior;
* observed behavior;
* relevant exception;
* stack trace;
* captured output where useful;
* relevant fixture or setup failure.

Failure output should minimize unrelated information while preserving diagnostic context.

---

## Assertion Messages

Assertions should communicate meaningful differences between expected and actual behavior.

For example, a failure should ideally communicate:

```text
Expected:
FamilyStatus.ACTIVE

Actual:
FamilyStatus.SUSPENDED
```

rather than only:

```text
Assertion failed
```

Testing tools may generate detailed assertion output automatically.

Custom assertion messages should be used where they materially improve diagnosis.

---

## Failure Context

Some failures require additional contextual information.

Useful context may include:

* input data;
* identifiers;
* configuration values;
* test parameters;
* generated values;
* environment state;
* relevant events;
* dependency responses.

Sensitive information must never be exposed merely to improve diagnostics.

Diagnostic value must remain compatible with FamilyOS security and privacy requirements.

---

## Stack Traces

Stack traces are important diagnostic artifacts.

However, excessive stack-trace verbosity can hide the relevant failure.

Reporting configuration should seek a balance between:

* sufficient debugging information;
* readable output;
* manageable CI logs.

Full diagnostic information should remain accessible when needed.

---

## Setup and Teardown Failures

Failures occurring during fixture setup or resource cleanup must be clearly distinguished from failures in the test behavior itself.

Conceptually:

```text
Test Lifecycle
     │
     ├── Setup
     │     └── possible failure
     │
     ├── Execution
     │     └── possible failure
     │
     └── Teardown
           └── possible failure
```

This distinction helps determine whether the problem exists in:

* the product;
* the test;
* the fixture;
* the environment.

---

## Test Logging

Logs generated during tests should support diagnosis without overwhelming normal output.

Test logging should follow these principles:

* normal successful tests should remain reasonably quiet;
* failures should expose relevant logs;
* log levels should be meaningful;
* logs should include useful context;
* sensitive data must not be logged;
* excessive debug output should not become permanent.

Tests should not rely on manually reading uncontrolled console output as their primary validation mechanism.

---

## Captured Output

Testing frameworks may capture:

* standard output;
* standard error;
* logs.

Captured output can be attached to failures when useful.

This allows successful executions to remain concise while preserving diagnostic information for failed tests.

---

## Structured Test Reports

Automated environments should support machine-readable test reports where appropriate.

Structured reports enable:

* CI integration;
* historical storage;
* test-result aggregation;
* dashboard generation;
* automated analysis;
* failure tracking.

Common structured reporting formats may be used where supported by the FamilyOS toolchain.

The framework should prefer interoperable formats rather than unnecessary proprietary representations.

---

## Test Artifacts

Some tests produce artifacts useful for debugging or validation.

Examples include:

* logs;
* generated files;
* database snapshots;
* command output;
* request-response traces;
* benchmark results;
* coverage reports;
* screenshots where applicable;
* generated configuration.

Artifacts should be retained when they provide meaningful diagnostic value.

Artifact retention must remain proportional to:

* storage cost;
* sensitivity;
* debugging value;
* lifecycle stage.

---

## Artifact Naming

Test artifacts should use predictable naming conventions.

Artifact names should help identify:

* execution;
* test;
* component;
* artifact type.

Names should avoid ambiguous patterns such as:

```text
output.txt
result.log
data.json
```

when multiple artifacts may exist.

Prefer descriptive context.

For example:

```text
communication-contract-test.log
finance-plugin-coverage.xml
migration-validation-report.json
```

---

## Execution Metadata

Test reports should capture enough metadata to reproduce and interpret execution.

Relevant metadata may include:

```text
Commit
Branch
Operating System
Runtime Version
Dependency Set
Execution Profile
Test Tool Version
Timestamp
CI Job
Configuration Profile
```

Not every local test execution requires persistent metadata.

Automated and release-related execution should provide stronger traceability.

---

## Environment Visibility

Environment differences frequently explain inconsistent test behavior.

Reports should make significant execution-environment characteristics visible when relevant.

Examples include:

* Python version;
* operating system;
* architecture;
* dependency versions;
* feature flags;
* database implementation;
* configuration profile.

This information is especially important for compatibility testing and CI-only failures.

---

## Test Observability

Test observability extends beyond individual execution results.

It answers questions such as:

* Is the test suite becoming slower?
* Are failures increasing?
* Which tests fail most frequently?
* Which tests are flaky?
* Which components have the weakest validation?
* Are skipped tests accumulating?
* Are CI failures primarily product failures or infrastructure failures?
* Is test reliability improving?

Observability therefore evaluates the health of the testing system itself.

---

## Observability Dimensions

The FamilyOS Testing Framework recognizes several important observability dimensions.

```text
Test Observability
      │
      ├── Correctness
      ├── Reliability
      ├── Performance
      ├── Coverage
      ├── Stability
      ├── Execution
      └── Trends
```

No single metric can represent overall testing quality.

---

## Test Health Metrics

Useful test-health metrics may include:

* total test count;
* pass rate;
* failure rate;
* flaky-test count;
* skipped-test count;
* quarantined-test count;
* average execution duration;
* full-suite duration;
* slowest tests;
* retry count;
* timeout count;
* coverage trends.

Metrics should support engineering decisions rather than exist solely for reporting.

---

## Test Count

Test count can indicate growth of the validation system.

However, test count alone is not a quality metric.

For example:

```text
10 meaningful tests
```

may provide more confidence than:

```text
100 redundant tests
```

Test quantity must never substitute for validation quality.

---

## Pass Rate

Pass rate provides information about execution outcomes but must be interpreted carefully.

A high pass rate does not necessarily indicate strong quality if:

* important tests are missing;
* tests are skipped;
* flaky tests are retried until passing;
* assertions are weak;
* validation scope is incomplete.

Pass rate is therefore one signal among many.

---

## Failure Rate

Failure-rate trends can identify:

* unstable components;
* problematic integrations;
* recurring regressions;
* infrastructure issues.

Repeated failures in the same subsystem should trigger investigation rather than normalization of failure.

---

## Flaky Test Metrics

Flaky tests must be measurable.

Useful indicators include:

* number of known flaky tests;
* frequency of nondeterministic failures;
* retry frequency;
* affected components;
* average time to remediation.

The objective should be a sustained reduction of flakiness.

---

## Skipped Test Metrics

Skipped tests should be tracked over time.

A growing skipped-test population can indicate hidden validation debt.

Observability should make it possible to distinguish:

* intentional platform-specific skips;
* temporary skips;
* unsupported environments;
* incomplete features;
* obsolete tests.

---

## Quarantine Metrics

Quarantined tests should be visible separately from ordinary skipped tests.

A quarantine mechanism must never make unstable tests invisible.

Useful reporting includes:

* quarantine reason;
* date introduced;
* responsible component;
* remediation status;
* duration in quarantine.

Long-lived quarantine entries should trigger review.

---

## Execution Duration Metrics

Execution performance should be monitored at multiple levels.

Examples include:

```text
Repository Suite
   │
   ├── Unit Tests
   ├── Integration Tests
   ├── Functional Tests
   ├── Contract Tests
   └── System Tests
```

Duration trends help detect gradual degradation before execution time becomes a major development constraint.

---

## Slow Test Reporting

The testing system should make the slowest tests discoverable.

Slow-test reports may identify:

* individual test duration;
* setup duration;
* teardown duration;
* test category;
* owning component.

This information supports targeted optimization.

---

## Performance Test Reporting

Performance-test results require specialized reporting.

Reports may include:

* latency;
* throughput;
* operations per second;
* memory consumption;
* CPU utilization;
* benchmark distribution;
* baseline comparison;
* regression percentage.

Performance results should include enough environmental context to make comparisons meaningful.

---

## Historical Reporting

Persistent test results enable historical analysis.

Historical information may reveal patterns invisible in individual runs.

For example:

```text
Execution Time

Run 1  ███████
Run 2  ████████
Run 3  █████████
Run 4  ██████████
Run 5  ███████████
```

A gradual increase in duration may indicate accumulated test-suite performance debt.

---

## Trend Analysis

Trend analysis should focus on meaningful engineering signals.

Possible trends include:

* suite duration;
* test count;
* failure frequency;
* flaky-test population;
* skip count;
* coverage;
* benchmark performance.

Trends should be interpreted with repository evolution in mind.

An increasing test count, for example, may naturally increase total execution duration.

---

## Regression Visibility

Testing observability should make recurring regressions identifiable.

If the same class of defect repeatedly appears, the testing system should help answer:

* Was a regression test added?
* Is the regression test executing?
* Is the affected component sufficiently covered?
* Does the failure indicate an architectural weakness?

Reporting should therefore support learning from defects rather than merely recording them.

---

## CI Reporting

Continuous integration should present test results prominently.

A CI execution should make it easy to determine:

```text
Did validation run?
        │
        ▼
Did validation pass?
        │
        ├── Yes → continue
        │
        └── No
             │
             ▼
        What failed?
             │
             ▼
        Why did it fail?
```

Developers should not need to inspect unrelated build logs to discover basic test results.

---

## Pull Request Reporting

Where supported by the engineering platform, pull requests may surface test information such as:

* validation status;
* failed test groups;
* coverage changes;
* required quality gates;
* relevant artifacts.

Reporting should remain concise enough to support review without flooding the pull request with unnecessary automated output.

---

## Release Reporting

Release validation requires stronger evidence than ordinary development execution.

Release reports may include:

* complete test-suite results;
* compatibility validation;
* regression validation;
* performance validation;
* unresolved quarantines;
* known skips;
* quality-gate status;
* relevant test artifacts.

Release decisions should be based on explicit validation evidence.

---

## Quality Gate Integration

Test reporting feeds FamilyOS quality gates.

Conceptually:

```text
Test Execution
      │
      ▼
Test Report
      │
      ▼
Quality Evaluation
      │
      ├── Required tests passed?
      ├── Critical failures?
      ├── Coverage acceptable?
      ├── Performance acceptable?
      └── Known risks?
      │
      ▼
Gate Decision
```

Quality gates should use structured evidence whenever possible.

---

## Dashboarding

As FamilyOS grows, dashboards may provide aggregated visibility into test health.

Potential dashboard information includes:

* current suite status;
* execution trends;
* flaky tests;
* quarantined tests;
* coverage;
* performance;
* component-level health.

Dashboards should complement detailed reports rather than replace them.

A dashboard identifies where attention is needed.

Detailed execution evidence explains why.

---

## Alerting

Some test-observability conditions may justify automated alerts.

Examples include:

* repeated failure on a protected branch;
* major test-suite performance regression;
* critical performance benchmark regression;
* sudden increase in flaky tests;
* required validation no longer executing.

Alerting should focus on actionable conditions.

Excessive alerts reduce their value.

---

## Ownership

Important testing signals should have identifiable ownership.

When reporting reveals:

* persistent failures;
* flaky tests;
* slow tests;
* quarantined tests;
* coverage gaps;
* benchmark regressions,

the responsible engineering area should be identifiable.

Observability without ownership creates information without remediation.

---

## Test Failure Classification

Failures may be classified to improve analysis.

Possible categories include:

```text
Product Defect
Test Defect
Infrastructure Failure
Configuration Failure
Dependency Failure
Environment Failure
Flaky Behavior
Unknown
```

Classification should not delay immediate debugging but can improve long-term trend analysis.

---

## Infrastructure Failure Visibility

Infrastructure failures must be distinguishable from product failures.

Examples include:

* CI worker failure;
* unavailable dependency;
* network outage;
* corrupted environment;
* storage failure.

Treating infrastructure failures as ordinary test failures can distort product-quality metrics.

---

## Warning Reporting

Warnings generated during test execution should remain visible.

Warnings may indicate:

* deprecated APIs;
* unsafe behavior;
* configuration issues;
* future compatibility problems;
* resource leaks.

A test suite that passes while continuously emitting ignored warnings may still contain significant engineering debt.

---

## Coverage Reporting

Coverage reports may be integrated into testing observability.

Coverage reporting should identify:

* overall coverage;
* component coverage;
* uncovered areas;
* coverage changes.

Coverage is a diagnostic metric rather than proof of correctness.

High coverage cannot compensate for weak assertions or missing scenarios.

---

## Reporting Retention

Not every report needs indefinite retention.

Retention policy may depend on:

* execution type;
* branch;
* release status;
* debugging requirements;
* storage constraints;
* governance requirements.

Release validation evidence may require longer retention than routine local or feature-branch execution.

---

## Privacy and Security

Test reports and artifacts must respect FamilyOS security and privacy principles.

Reports must avoid exposing:

* credentials;
* authentication tokens;
* personal information;
* production secrets;
* private user data;
* sensitive configuration.

Sensitive values should be:

* excluded;
* masked;
* anonymized;
* replaced with synthetic test data.

Debugging convenience does not justify leaking protected information.

---

## Machine Readability

Where test results feed automation, reports should provide machine-readable representations.

Machine-readable reports enable:

* automated quality gates;
* trend collection;
* dashboard generation;
* test-result aggregation;
* historical analysis.

Human-readable output should still be available for debugging.

The preferred model is therefore:

```text
Test Results
    │
    ├── Human-Readable Output
    │
    └── Machine-Readable Output
```

---

## Reporting Reliability

Reporting mechanisms themselves must be reliable.

A test execution must not appear successful because the reporting system failed to record failures.

Likewise, reporting infrastructure should not unnecessarily invalidate otherwise valid test execution unless the missing report is itself a mandatory validation artifact.

Critical reporting failures must remain visible.

---

## Local Reporting

Local test output should optimize developer feedback.

It should prioritize:

* concise execution status;
* immediate failures;
* useful assertion differences;
* short execution summaries;
* optional access to detailed diagnostics.

Developers should be able to increase verbosity when deeper investigation is required.

---

## Automated Reporting

Automated environments require stronger persistence and traceability.

CI reporting may include:

```text
Terminal Output
+
Structured Results
+
Artifacts
+
Coverage
+
Execution Metadata
```

The exact combination depends on the execution profile.

---

## Reporting Profiles

FamilyOS may define reporting profiles aligned with execution profiles.

### Developer Reporting Profile

Optimized for immediate feedback.

Includes:

* concise terminal output;
* detailed failures;
* duration summary.

### Pull Request Reporting Profile

Optimized for review and integration.

Includes:

* test summary;
* failed test details;
* quality-gate status;
* relevant artifacts.

### Full Validation Reporting Profile

Optimized for repository-level assessment.

Includes:

* complete structured results;
* coverage;
* timing;
* skipped and quarantined tests;
* execution metadata.

### Release Reporting Profile

Optimized for auditable release confidence.

Includes:

* complete validation evidence;
* regression status;
* compatibility results;
* performance results where applicable;
* unresolved test risks.

---

## Observability Maturity

Test observability may evolve progressively.

```text
Level 1
Basic pass/fail reporting

Level 2
Structured test reports

Level 3
Historical metrics

Level 4
Trend analysis

Level 5
Integrated quality intelligence
```

FamilyOS should evolve toward higher maturity without introducing unnecessary operational complexity before it provides meaningful value.

---

## Anti-Patterns

The following reporting and observability practices are discouraged or prohibited.

### Pass/Fail Only

A binary status without useful diagnostic information creates unnecessary debugging effort.

---

### Hidden Skips

Skipped tests must not disappear from reporting.

---

### Silent Retries

Retries must remain visible.

---

### Log Flooding

Excessive output reduces diagnostic clarity.

---

### Metrics Without Purpose

Collecting large numbers of metrics without engineering use creates observability noise.

---

### Permanent Quarantine Without Visibility

Quarantined tests must remain visible and actionable.

---

### Sensitive Data in Reports

Test diagnostics must never expose protected information.

---

### Dashboard-Only Diagnostics

Dashboards summarize health but must not replace detailed failure evidence.

---

### Ignored Historical Degradation

Slow deterioration in execution reliability or performance should not be accepted simply because individual runs still succeed.

---

## Reporting Governance

Reporting conventions and observability policies are governed by the FamilyOS Testing Framework.

Changes affecting:

* mandatory report formats;
* test-result retention;
* CI reporting;
* quality-gate integration;
* observability metrics;
* test-health thresholds;
* artifact handling;
* failure classification;
* dashboarding;
* release evidence

must preserve the principles established by this framework.

---

## Relationship With Test Execution

Test reporting and test execution are closely related but represent different responsibilities.

Test execution answers:

> What happened when the tests ran?

Test reporting answers:

> How do we communicate what happened?

Test observability answers:

> What does this execution tell us about the health and evolution of the testing system?

Together:

```text
Execution
   │
   ▼
Reporting
   │
   ▼
Observability
   │
   ▼
Understanding
   │
   ▼
Action
```

---

## Relationship With Quality Engineering

Testing observability contributes directly to the FamilyOS Quality Framework.

Testing signals may inform:

* quality gates;
* engineering reviews;
* release decisions;
* technical-debt prioritization;
* reliability initiatives;
* performance optimization.

Testing information therefore participates in broader engineering governance.

---

## Success Criteria

The FamilyOS test reporting and observability model is considered effective when:

* test outcomes are immediately understandable;
* failures provide actionable diagnostics;
* execution context is traceable;
* skipped tests remain visible;
* flaky tests are measurable;
* quarantined tests are traceable;
* slow tests can be identified;
* execution trends can be analyzed;
* CI results are easy to interpret;
* release validation produces explicit evidence;
* quality gates consume reliable testing information;
* reports do not expose sensitive information;
* historical degradation can be detected;
* testing health can be evaluated over time.

---

## Final Principle

The FamilyOS Testing Framework does not consider a test complete merely because it has executed.

Its result must become usable engineering evidence.

The governing principle is:

> Every test execution must produce enough trustworthy evidence to understand the result, diagnose failures, evaluate testing health, and support the next engineering decision.

Testing creates confidence.

Reporting makes that confidence visible.

Observability makes that confidence measurable over time.
