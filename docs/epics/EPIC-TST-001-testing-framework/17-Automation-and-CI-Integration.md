# Testing Framework

## 17 Automation and CI Integration

### Overview

Automated testing is a core capability of the FamilyOS engineering platform.

Tests provide the greatest value when they are executed consistently as part of the engineering workflow rather than depending exclusively on manual developer action.

The FamilyOS Testing Framework therefore integrates test execution directly into continuous integration and automated validation processes.

Automation ensures that important validation occurs:

* consistently;
* repeatedly;
* independently of individual developer machines;
* at predictable lifecycle stages;
* with reproducible environments;
* with visible results;
* with enforceable outcomes.

Continuous integration provides the operational mechanism through which testing becomes a permanent part of software delivery.

The objective is not simply to run tests automatically.

The objective is to create an automated validation system that protects FamilyOS engineering quality while preserving practical developer feedback loops.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to define the official FamilyOS approach to automated test execution and continuous integration integration.

It establishes principles and requirements for:

* automated testing;
* continuous integration;
* validation pipelines;
* test execution stages;
* test selection;
* test environments;
* dependency preparation;
* caching;
* parallelization;
* failure handling;
* reporting;
* quality gate integration;
* branch protection;
* pull request validation;
* scheduled validation;
* release validation;
* CI reliability;
* automation governance.

The objective is to ensure that testing becomes an integral and enforceable part of the FamilyOS engineering lifecycle.

---

## Core Principle

The FamilyOS Testing Framework follows this principle:

> Validation that is important enough to protect the platform should be automated whenever practical.

Manual testing remains valuable for scenarios requiring human judgment.

However, repeatable engineering validation should not depend unnecessarily on individual memory or discipline.

---

## Automation Principles

FamilyOS test automation follows several fundamental principles.

### Repeatability

Automated tests should execute consistently whenever the same validation conditions are provided.

---

### Reproducibility

CI environments should make failures reproducible locally whenever practical.

---

### Determinism

Automated validation must minimize nondeterministic behavior.

Unreliable automation weakens confidence in the complete engineering process.

---

### Fast Feedback

Validation should detect problems as close as possible to the change that introduced them.

---

### Progressive Confidence

Automation should execute increasingly comprehensive validation as changes progress through the lifecycle.

---

### Visibility

Automation results must remain visible and understandable.

---

### Enforcement

Mandatory validation must be enforceable where engineering policy requires it.

---

### Efficiency

Automation should use compute resources responsibly without sacrificing necessary validation.

---

## Automation Model

The FamilyOS automated validation model can be represented as:

```text
Source Change
      │
      ▼
Automated Trigger
      │
      ▼
Validation Pipeline
      │
      ├── Static Validation
      ├── Fast Tests
      ├── Integration Tests
      ├── Extended Tests
      └── Quality Evaluation
      │
      ▼
Result
      │
      ├── Accept
      └── Reject
```

The exact stages may vary according to execution context.

---

## Continuous Integration

Continuous integration is the practice of validating changes frequently as they are integrated into the repository.

CI should detect problems before they propagate through the engineering lifecycle.

FamilyOS CI should support validation of:

* source changes;
* pull requests;
* protected branches;
* dependency changes;
* framework modifications;
* release candidates.

CI provides a shared validation environment independent of individual developer workstations.

---

## CI Responsibilities

The CI system may be responsible for:

* preparing execution environments;
* installing dependencies;
* validating source formatting;
* running static analysis;
* performing type validation;
* executing tests;
* collecting test reports;
* producing coverage reports;
* evaluating quality gates;
* generating artifacts;
* publishing validation results.

The exact responsibilities depend on the pipeline and lifecycle stage.

---

## CI Pipeline Architecture

A conceptual FamilyOS CI pipeline may follow:

```text
Repository Change
       │
       ▼
Environment Preparation
       │
       ▼
Static Validation
       │
       ▼
Fast Test Suite
       │
       ▼
Integration Validation
       │
       ▼
Extended Validation
       │
       ▼
Reporting
       │
       ▼
Testing Gates
```

Pipeline stages should reflect increasing validation cost and confidence.

---

## Validation Stages

CI pipelines should organize validation into meaningful stages.

Typical stages may include:

```text
Stage 1
Repository and syntax validation

Stage 2
Static analysis

Stage 3
Type validation

Stage 4
Unit tests

Stage 5
Integration tests

Stage 6
Contract and functional tests

Stage 7
Extended system validation

Stage 8
Quality gates
```

Not every pipeline requires every stage.

Execution scope should reflect the purpose of the pipeline.

---

## Early Validation

Cheap validation should generally execute before expensive validation.

For example:

```text
Syntax
   │
   ▼
Lint
   │
   ▼
Type Check
   │
   ▼
Unit Tests
   │
   ▼
Integration Tests
   │
   ▼
System Tests
```

This allows obvious problems to terminate validation before expensive resources are consumed.

---

## Static Validation Integration

Testing automation operates alongside other engineering validation capabilities.

CI may perform:

* formatting checks;
* lint validation;
* type checking;
* architecture validation;
* dependency validation.

These checks complement runtime testing.

A successful test suite does not compensate for failed mandatory static validation.

---

## Test Execution Profiles

CI should use explicitly defined test execution profiles.

Possible profiles include:

* fast validation;
* pull request validation;
* protected branch validation;
* scheduled full validation;
* release validation.

Each profile should define:

* required test categories;
* environment;
* execution options;
* reporting requirements;
* applicable gates.

---

## Fast Validation Profile

The fast validation profile provides rapid feedback.

It may include:

* static validation;
* unit tests;
* lightweight integration tests;
* targeted regression tests.

This profile should execute frequently.

---

## Pull Request Validation

Pull requests should automatically execute validation appropriate to integration risk.

A typical pull request flow may include:

```text
Pull Request
     │
     ▼
Static Checks
     │
     ▼
Unit Tests
     │
     ▼
Integration Tests
     │
     ▼
Relevant Extended Tests
     │
     ▼
Testing Gates
     │
     ▼
Merge Eligibility
```

Required validation must succeed before merge when repository policy demands it.

---

## Protected Branch Validation

Protected branches require strong confidence.

Validation may include:

* complete fast suite;
* integration tests;
* regression tests;
* contract tests;
* functional tests;
* applicable system tests.

Protected branch failures should be visible and investigated promptly.

---

## Full Validation Profile

A complete validation profile may execute a broader test set than routine pull request validation.

It may include:

* all unit tests;
* all integration tests;
* contract tests;
* functional tests;
* system tests;
* regression tests;
* selected compatibility validation.

Full validation may be triggered:

* before releases;
* on protected branches;
* on schedule;
* after significant framework changes.

---

## Release Validation Profile

Release validation should provide the strongest automated confidence required by the FamilyOS lifecycle.

It may include:

```text
Static Validation
+
Complete Automated Test Suite
+
Regression Validation
+
Compatibility Validation
+
Performance Validation
+
Testing Gates
```

Release validation results should be retained as engineering evidence.

---

## Automated Triggers

CI validation may be triggered by repository events.

Examples include:

* commit push;
* pull request creation;
* pull request update;
* merge;
* protected branch update;
* tag creation;
* release candidate creation;
* manual workflow request;
* scheduled execution.

Triggers should correspond to meaningful engineering events.

---

## Push Validation

Push-based validation may provide early feedback before pull request integration.

The scope may be smaller than protected-branch validation to preserve fast feedback.

---

## Pull Request Triggers

Pull request validation should rerun when relevant source changes occur.

A pull request should not remain approved based on validation performed against obsolete source state.

---

## Merge Validation

Where repository architecture requires it, merged source may be validated again after integration.

This can identify interaction problems that did not exist on an isolated feature branch.

---

## Scheduled Validation

Some validation may execute on a schedule.

Scheduled testing can detect problems caused by:

* dependency evolution;
* environment changes;
* external service changes;
* long-running regression scenarios;
* compatibility drift.

Examples may include:

```text
Nightly Validation
Weekly Extended Validation
Periodic Compatibility Validation
```

Scheduled validation complements change-triggered CI.

---

## Manual CI Triggers

Some workflows may support manually triggered validation.

Manual triggers are useful for:

* release preparation;
* debugging CI configuration;
* extended validation;
* performance testing;
* environment-specific validation.

Manual workflows must not replace mandatory automated triggers.

---

## Change-Based Test Selection

CI may select tests based on changed code.

For example:

```text
Changed Component
       │
       ▼
Dependency Analysis
       │
       ▼
Relevant Tests
```

Selection can reduce execution time.

However, selective CI testing must remain conservative enough to avoid hidden validation gaps.

---

## Dependency-Aware Selection

More advanced test selection may consider:

* package dependencies;
* plugin relationships;
* architecture layers;
* changed interfaces;
* affected contracts.

A change in a shared framework component may require significantly broader validation than a change inside an isolated leaf module.

---

## Full-Suite Safety Net

Selective execution must never permanently eliminate complete validation.

FamilyOS should preserve regular full-suite execution as a safety mechanism against:

* incorrect dependency analysis;
* hidden coupling;
* incomplete test mapping;
* unexpected cross-component effects.

---

## CI Environment

CI environments should be predictable and reproducible.

Environment configuration should define:

* runtime version;
* operating system where relevant;
* dependencies;
* required services;
* environment variables;
* test configuration.

Uncontrolled CI environment drift increases test instability.

---

## Environment Isolation

CI jobs should avoid relying on mutable shared state.

Each execution should establish its required environment independently where practical.

Isolation reduces:

* order dependencies;
* cross-job interference;
* hidden state;
* nondeterministic failures.

---

## Environment Parity

Local and CI environments should remain sufficiently aligned to support failure reproduction.

Exact machine parity is not always required.

However, differences affecting application behavior should be documented and controlled.

---

## Dependency Installation

Dependency installation should be deterministic.

CI should use the repository's official dependency definitions.

Uncontrolled installation of latest dependency versions can create unrelated failures.

---

## Dependency Caching

Caching may reduce CI execution time.

Common cache candidates include:

* package downloads;
* dependency environments;
* build artifacts;
* tool caches.

Caching should improve performance without compromising correctness.

---

## Cache Safety

Caches must be invalidated when their underlying inputs change.

Unsafe caching can produce false validation results.

Cache keys should consider relevant inputs such as:

* dependency files;
* runtime version;
* platform;
* build configuration.

---

## Test Data Preparation

CI should generate or provision required test data predictably.

Test data should use:

* fixtures;
* factories;
* synthetic datasets;
* controlled snapshots.

CI should not depend on uncontrolled production data.

---

## Service Dependencies

Integration and system tests may require services such as:

* databases;
* message systems;
* APIs;
* storage services.

These dependencies should be provisioned in controlled test configurations.

---

## External Services

Real external services should be minimized in normal CI validation.

External services introduce:

* latency;
* outages;
* quotas;
* authentication requirements;
* changing behavior.

Where real external integration is necessary, tests should be explicitly categorized.

---

## Secrets in CI

Some integration tests may require credentials.

Secrets must be provided using secure CI mechanisms.

They must not be:

* committed to the repository;
* printed in logs;
* included in reports;
* exposed through artifacts.

Testing requirements do not override FamilyOS security principles.

---

## Parallel Execution

CI may execute tests in parallel to reduce total validation duration.

Parallelization may occur:

```text
Pipeline
   │
   ├── Unit Tests
   ├── Integration Tests
   ├── Contract Tests
   └── Static Validation
```

or within individual test suites.

Parallelism requires reliable test isolation.

---

## Pipeline Parallelism

Independent CI stages may execute simultaneously.

For example:

```text
             ┌── Lint
Source ──────┼── Type Check
             ├── Unit Tests
             └── Documentation Validation
```

Dependent stages should begin only after required predecessors succeed.

---

## Test Sharding

Large test suites may be divided across multiple CI workers.

```text
Full Suite
    │
    ├── Shard A
    ├── Shard B
    ├── Shard C
    └── Shard D
```

Results are then aggregated.

Sharding should seek balanced execution time.

---

## Matrix Testing

CI matrices may validate multiple supported environments.

Examples include:

* multiple Python versions;
* multiple operating systems;
* multiple dependency configurations.

Conceptually:

```text
                 ┌── Python A / Linux
Test Matrix ─────┼── Python B / Linux
                 ├── Python A / macOS
                 └── Python B / macOS
```

Matrix scope should reflect officially supported compatibility requirements.

---

## Compatibility Cost

Compatibility matrices can multiply execution cost quickly.

Matrix expansion should therefore be governed.

Not every combination requires validation on every commit.

Different compatibility scopes may be assigned to:

* pull requests;
* nightly validation;
* release validation.

---

## Fail-Fast Behavior

CI may stop dependent validation after critical earlier failures.

For example:

```text
Dependency Installation
       │
       └── Failure
              │
              ▼
        Stop Test Execution
```

or:

```text
Static Validation
       │
       └── Failure
              │
              ▼
        Skip Expensive Tests
```

Fail-fast behavior can reduce unnecessary compute consumption.

---

## Diagnostic Completeness

Fail-fast must not eliminate useful independent diagnostics when broader information would materially reduce debugging time.

The appropriate strategy depends on:

* stage cost;
* independence;
* debugging value;
* CI capacity.

---

## CI Failure Classification

CI failures should be distinguishable by type.

Possible categories include:

```text
Source Validation Failure
Test Failure
Infrastructure Failure
Dependency Failure
Environment Failure
Timeout
Configuration Failure
```

This distinction improves diagnosis and historical observability.

---

## Infrastructure Failures

Infrastructure failures should not automatically be interpreted as application defects.

Examples include:

* unavailable CI runner;
* network outage;
* corrupted worker;
* provider outage;
* storage failure.

CI infrastructure reliability is part of the automated testing system.

---

## Retry Policy

CI-level retries should be used carefully.

Automatic retries may be appropriate for clearly transient infrastructure conditions.

They should not be used to normalize unreliable tests.

A test that fails and succeeds only after retry must remain observable as unstable.

---

## Timeout Policy

CI jobs and test stages should use reasonable timeout limits.

Timeouts protect against indefinitely blocked automation.

Timeouts should be defined according to expected execution behavior rather than arbitrary values.

---

## Test Reporting Integration

CI should preserve test reporting requirements defined by:

```text
16-Test-Reporting-and-Observability.md
```

Automation should make results easy to discover.

CI reports may include:

* execution summary;
* failed tests;
* skipped tests;
* duration;
* structured results;
* coverage;
* artifacts.

---

## Artifact Collection

CI may retain test artifacts for diagnosis.

Useful artifacts include:

* structured test reports;
* logs;
* coverage reports;
* benchmark results;
* generated debugging output.

Artifact collection should remain controlled.

---

## Artifact Upload on Failure

Some diagnostic artifacts may only need retention when validation fails.

This reduces storage consumption while preserving debugging evidence.

---

## Quality Gate Integration

Automated test execution feeds Testing Gates.

Conceptually:

```text
Automated Tests
      │
      ▼
Structured Results
      │
      ▼
Gate Evaluation
      │
      ├── Pass
      │
      └── Fail
      │
      ▼
Engineering Action
```

Testing gates are defined further in:

```text
18-Testing-Gates.md
```

---

## Required Status Checks

Repository governance may designate specific CI validations as required status checks.

A protected operation may require:

```text
Lint          PASS
Type Check    PASS
Unit Tests    PASS
Integration   PASS
Testing Gate  PASS
```

Only after all required checks succeed may progression be permitted.

---

## Branch Protection

CI testing can participate directly in repository branch protection.

Protected branches may require:

* successful validation;
* required reviews;
* current test results;
* successful quality gates.

Testing therefore becomes enforceable repository policy rather than optional developer convention.

---

## Stale Validation

Validation should correspond to the current source state.

If source changes after successful testing, previous results may no longer be sufficient.

CI systems should ensure that required validation applies to the revision being integrated.

---

## Merge Queue Integration

Repositories using merge queues may require validation against the prospective integrated state.

This helps detect conflicts between independently successful changes.

---

## Automation and Regression Testing

Regression tests should automatically execute at appropriate lifecycle stages.

When defects are fixed and regression tests are added, those tests should become part of future automated validation.

This ensures that known defects remain protected against recurrence.

---

## Contract Testing Automation

Contract tests are particularly suitable for CI automation.

They can detect compatibility problems between:

* plugins;
* services;
* APIs;
* adapters;
* interfaces.

Contract failures should block incompatible changes according to governance policy.

---

## Plugin Validation

FamilyOS official plugins should participate in automated validation.

Plugin validation may include:

* plugin-specific unit tests;
* capability tests;
* policy tests;
* rule tests;
* contract tests;
* plugin metadata validation;
* integration tests.

A plugin change should trigger the validation necessary to protect its supported contracts.

---

## Shared Framework Validation

Changes to shared framework components may affect many plugins and domains.

Automation should therefore broaden validation when changes affect shared infrastructure.

For example:

```text
Shared Runtime Change
        │
        ▼
Broad Plugin Validation
```

A narrow test selection may be insufficient for high-impact framework changes.

---

## Documentation-Driven Validation

Where documentation or specifications define executable contracts, CI may verify consistency between:

* implementation;
* specification;
* generated artifacts;
* validation rules.

This supports FamilyOS specification-driven engineering principles.

---

## Generated Artifact Validation

CI should validate generated artifacts where they form part of the repository contract.

Possible checks include:

* generation succeeds;
* generated output is deterministic;
* generated output matches committed artifacts where required;
* generated output passes relevant tests.

---

## Database Migration Automation

If FamilyOS introduces persistent data migrations, CI should validate migration behavior.

This may include:

* migration application;
* upgrade paths;
* rollback behavior where supported;
* schema compatibility;
* data preservation.

Migration tests may belong to extended or release validation profiles.

---

## Performance Test Automation

Performance testing may be integrated into CI selectively.

Routine pull requests may use lightweight performance checks.

More expensive benchmarks may execute:

* nightly;
* before release;
* on dedicated infrastructure.

Performance automation must account for environment variability.

---

## Performance Regression Gates

Stable benchmarks may eventually support performance-related gates.

Such gates must use realistic tolerances.

Normal execution noise must not cause frequent false failures.

---

## Scheduled Full Validation

A scheduled full validation pipeline provides a safety net against validation gaps.

For example:

```text
Nightly
   │
   ▼
Full Repository Suite
   │
   ▼
Compatibility Validation
   │
   ▼
Extended Regression
```

This is particularly useful when pull request validation uses selective execution.

---

## Dependency Update Validation

Automated dependency updates should trigger appropriate testing.

Dependency changes may affect behavior even when application source code is unchanged.

CI should validate supported dependency modifications before integration.

---

## Toolchain Update Validation

Changes to testing tools, linters, type checkers, build systems, or runtime versions should receive broad validation.

Toolchain updates may affect:

* test discovery;
* execution semantics;
* dependency behavior;
* static checks;
* CI infrastructure.

---

## CI Configuration as Code

CI configuration should be version-controlled where supported.

This provides:

* reviewability;
* traceability;
* reproducibility;
* history;
* controlled evolution.

Automation configuration is part of the engineering system and should be treated as code.

---

## CI Configuration Testing

Significant CI logic should itself be validated where practical.

Broken automation can disable critical engineering safeguards.

Validation may include:

* syntax checks;
* workflow validation;
* reusable automation tests;
* local simulation where supported.

---

## Automation Ownership

CI pipelines require clear ownership.

Ownership should exist for:

* pipeline configuration;
* failing infrastructure;
* required test stages;
* shared test tooling;
* quality gate integration.

Without ownership, automation degradation can persist indefinitely.

---

## CI Reliability

A reliable CI system should produce trustworthy results.

Important reliability properties include:

* low infrastructure failure rate;
* predictable execution;
* reproducible environments;
* stable test results;
* clear diagnostics.

Engineers should not routinely need to rerun pipelines simply to obtain a valid result.

---

## CI Health Metrics

Useful CI health indicators may include:

* pipeline success rate;
* infrastructure failure rate;
* median validation duration;
* queue duration;
* retry frequency;
* cancellation frequency;
* flaky test frequency.

These metrics can help distinguish product problems from automation problems.

---

## Pipeline Duration

CI duration affects developer productivity.

Long pipelines increase:

* feedback latency;
* merge delay;
* context switching.

Pipeline performance should therefore be monitored.

---

## Pipeline Optimization

Optimization may include:

* caching;
* parallelization;
* sharding;
* selective execution;
* early failure detection;
* reduced environment setup;
* reuse of safe artifacts.

Optimization must not create validation gaps.

---

## Queue Time

Total feedback time includes more than test execution.

Conceptually:

```text
Feedback Time
=
Queue Time
+
Environment Setup
+
Validation Execution
+
Reporting
```

A fast test suite can still produce slow developer feedback if CI infrastructure is heavily queued.

---

## Cancellation Strategy

Obsolete CI executions may be cancelled when newer revisions make them irrelevant.

For example, if several updates are pushed rapidly to a pull request, earlier validation runs may no longer provide useful integration evidence.

Cancellation can conserve CI capacity.

---

## Automation Security

CI environments must follow FamilyOS security standards.

Automation must protect:

* credentials;
* secrets;
* tokens;
* signing material;
* protected environments.

Untrusted source changes must not gain inappropriate access to protected credentials.

---

## Least Privilege

CI workflows should receive only the permissions required for their responsibilities.

Testing jobs generally should not receive production-level privileges.

---

## Untrusted Contributions

Where external or untrusted contributions are supported, CI must account for the security risks of executing untrusted code.

Sensitive credentials must not be exposed to such executions.

---

## Supply Chain Considerations

CI dependencies and automation actions form part of the software supply chain.

FamilyOS should prefer:

* controlled dependencies;
* pinned or governed automation versions;
* reviewed CI integrations.

Testing automation must not become an uncontrolled execution path into the repository.

---

## CI Cost Management

Automated validation consumes compute resources.

FamilyOS should balance:

```text
Validation Confidence
        │
        ▼
Execution Cost
```

The goal is not minimal compute cost.

The goal is efficient confidence.

---

## Cost Optimization Principles

Automation cost may be controlled through:

* selective execution;
* stage ordering;
* cancellation of obsolete runs;
* safe caching;
* scheduled extended validation;
* matrix optimization.

Cost reduction must not compromise mandatory validation.

---

## Local and CI Consistency

Developers should have local commands corresponding closely to CI validation.

For example, the repository should make it practical to execute locally:

```text
Fast validation
Full tests
Lint
Type checking
Targeted plugin validation
```

This improves failure reproduction and reduces CI-only debugging.

---

## Single Source of Validation Logic

Where practical, local and CI execution should reuse the same underlying validation commands.

Duplicating validation logic between local scripts and CI configuration increases drift risk.

---

## Automation Failure Response

When automated validation fails:

1. the failure should be visible;
2. the failure should be classified where possible;
3. diagnostic evidence should be available;
4. the responsible change should not progress through protected gates;
5. the failure should be corrected or explicitly resolved through governance.

Repeated blind reruns are not an acceptable long-term response.

---

## Bypassing CI

Mandatory CI validation should not be bypassed casually.

Emergency bypass mechanisms, if supported, should require appropriate governance and traceability.

Bypasses should remain exceptional.

---

## Automation Exceptions

Some tests may not be suitable for normal CI execution.

Examples include:

* extremely expensive system tests;
* hardware-dependent tests;
* highly specialized compatibility tests;
* manual usability testing.

Such exceptions must be explicit.

Tests excluded from normal CI must have an alternative lifecycle location.

---

## Manual Testing Relationship

Automation does not eliminate manual testing.

Manual validation remains appropriate for:

* exploratory testing;
* usability evaluation;
* visual inspection;
* scenarios requiring human judgment.

Automated and manual testing are complementary.

---

## CI as Engineering Infrastructure

Continuous integration should be treated as engineering infrastructure.

It requires:

* architecture;
* maintenance;
* monitoring;
* ownership;
* performance management;
* security;
* governance.

A CI pipeline is not merely a collection of shell commands.

---

## Automation Maturity Model

FamilyOS test automation may evolve progressively.

```text
Level 1
Manual test execution

        │
        ▼

Level 2
Basic CI test execution

        │
        ▼

Level 3
Structured validation pipelines

        │
        ▼

Level 4
Selective and parallel validation

        │
        ▼

Level 5
Integrated quality gates and observability
```

FamilyOS should evolve automation maturity according to platform needs.

---

## Anti-Patterns

The following automation practices are discouraged or prohibited.

### CI Only After Merge

Testing exclusively after integration detects defects too late.

---

### Manual-Only Validation

Repeatable mandatory validation should not depend entirely on manual execution.

---

### Running Expensive Tests First

Cheap validation should normally execute before expensive validation.

---

### Hidden CI Failures

Failures must remain visible.

---

### Blind Retries

Repeated reruns must not replace diagnosis.

---

### Unlimited Matrices

Compatibility matrices must be governed to prevent uncontrolled cost growth.

---

### Unsafe Caching

Caching must not produce stale or incorrect validation results.

---

### Environment Drift

CI environments must not evolve unpredictably.

---

### Secrets in Logs

Automation must never expose protected credentials through test diagnostics.

---

### Permanent Disabled Jobs

Mandatory validation must not be silently disabled because it is inconvenient or unreliable.

---

### CI Configuration Without Ownership

Automation must have responsible maintainers.

---

## Governance

Automation and CI integration are governed by the FamilyOS Testing Framework and the broader FamilyOS Engineering Platform.

Significant changes affecting:

* required CI stages;
* validation profiles;
* branch protection;
* required status checks;
* execution environments;
* test matrices;
* automation security;
* testing gates;
* release validation

must follow appropriate engineering governance.

---

## Relationship With Test Execution

This document operationalizes the execution model defined in:

```text
15-Test-Execution-and-Performance.md
```

That document defines how tests should execute efficiently and reliably.

This document defines how those execution principles are embedded into automated workflows.

---

## Relationship With Reporting

Automated validation depends directly on the reporting requirements defined in:

```text
16-Test-Reporting-and-Observability.md
```

CI must produce sufficient evidence for engineers and automated gates to interpret validation results.

---

## Relationship With Testing Gates

Automation provides the execution mechanism used by:

```text
18-Testing-Gates.md
```

Testing gates convert validation evidence into explicit engineering progression decisions.

---

## Relationship With Governance and Lifecycle

Automation evolves together with the FamilyOS Testing Framework.

Changes to:

* validation requirements;
* supported environments;
* release policies;
* quality thresholds

may require corresponding CI evolution.

This relationship is further defined in:

```text
19-Governance-and-Test-Lifecycle.md
```

and:

```text
20-Framework-Lifecycle.md
```

---

## Success Criteria

FamilyOS automation and CI integration is considered effective when:

* important validation executes automatically;
* developers receive timely feedback;
* pull requests are validated before integration;
* required checks can be enforced;
* CI environments are reproducible;
* failures provide useful diagnostics;
* selective execution does not create hidden validation gaps;
* full-suite validation remains available;
* automation remains secure;
* CI performance remains practical;
* flaky automation is actively controlled;
* release validation produces reliable evidence;
* local and CI workflows remain sufficiently aligned;
* CI configuration remains governed and maintainable.

## Final Principle

The FamilyOS Testing Framework treats automated validation as a permanent part of the engineering lifecycle.

The governing principle is:

> Every meaningful change should encounter the appropriate automated evidence before it is allowed to become trusted platform state.

Automation makes testing consistent.

Continuous integration makes testing continuous.

Governance makes automated testing enforceable.
