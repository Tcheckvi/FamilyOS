# EPIC-TST-001 — Testing Framework

## Overview

This directory contains the official **FamilyOS Testing Framework** documentation.

EPIC-TST-001 establishes the principles, architecture, standards, execution model, automation strategy, governance, lifecycle, and validation model used to test the FamilyOS engineering platform.

The framework defines how FamilyOS creates and maintains trustworthy software validation across:

* core platform components;
* official plugins;
* domain implementations;
* runtime infrastructure;
* command-line interfaces;
* integrations;
* generated artifacts;
* shared engineering frameworks.

Testing is treated as a permanent engineering capability rather than a final verification phase.

---

## Purpose

The Testing Framework exists to ensure that FamilyOS engineering changes can be validated:

* consistently;
* deterministically;
* efficiently;
* automatically;
* observably;
* at the appropriate level;
* throughout the complete engineering lifecycle.

The framework establishes a common testing model for the entire FamilyOS ecosystem.

---

## Framework Objectives

EPIC-TST-001 provides the foundation required to:

* define official testing principles;
* establish testing architecture;
* define testing levels;
* standardize unit and integration testing;
* define functional and system validation;
* protect contracts;
* prevent regressions;
* govern test data and fixtures;
* standardize mocks and test doubles;
* enforce isolation and determinism;
* define coverage expectations;
* optimize execution and feedback;
* establish reporting and observability;
* integrate testing into CI;
* create enforceable testing gates;
* govern test lifecycle;
* evolve the Testing Framework safely;
* provide an implementation roadmap;
* define framework validation;
* track implementation readiness.

---

## Core Testing Principle

The Testing Framework is based on the following principle:

> Testing must produce trustworthy engineering evidence at the earliest responsible point in the development lifecycle.

The objective is not maximum test quantity.

The objective is sufficient, reliable, maintainable evidence.

---

## Documentation Structure

The Testing Framework is organized as a progressive architecture.

## Framework Architecture

The Testing Framework can be viewed as several connected layers.

```text
Testing Principles
        │
        ▼
Testing Architecture
        │
        ▼
Testing Levels
        │
        ▼
Test Design Practices
        │
        ▼
Execution
        │
        ▼
Reporting
        │
        ▼
Automation
        │
        ▼
Testing Gates
        │
        ▼
Governance
        │
        ▼
Framework Lifecycle
```

Each layer depends on the reliability of the previous layers.

---

## Testing Levels

The framework recognizes multiple complementary testing levels.

```text
Unit
  │
  ▼
Integration
  │
  ▼
Contract
  │
  ▼
Functional
  │
  ▼
System
```

Regression testing spans these levels and protects previously corrected defects.

Performance testing provides an additional validation dimension where operational characteristics matter.

No single testing level is sufficient for all FamilyOS behavior.

---

## Testing Strategy

FamilyOS favors a layered testing strategy.

Fast, deterministic validation should occur close to the code being modified.

Broader and more expensive tests should provide progressively stronger confidence at later lifecycle stages.

Conceptually:

```text
Developer Change
      │
      ▼
Targeted Tests
      │
      ▼
Unit Tests
      │
      ▼
Integration Tests
      │
      ▼
Contract / Functional Tests
      │
      ▼
System Validation
      │
      ▼
Release Validation
```

---

## Reliability

Reliability is the primary requirement of the Testing Framework.

Tests should be:

* deterministic;
* isolated;
* reproducible;
* independently executable;
* understandable;
* maintainable.

A fast but unreliable test suite does not provide trustworthy engineering evidence.

---

## Automation

Repeatable validation should be automated whenever practical.

FamilyOS testing automation may operate through:

* local validation commands;
* pull request workflows;
* protected branch workflows;
* scheduled validation;
* release pipelines.

Automation must remain reproducible and observable.

---

## Continuous Integration

Continuous integration converts testing from an optional activity into a permanent engineering process.

CI should progressively validate:

```text
Source
  │
  ▼
Static Validation
  │
  ▼
Automated Tests
  │
  ▼
Reporting
  │
  ▼
Testing Gates
```

The exact pipeline may evolve with repository maturity.

---

## Testing Gates

Testing gates translate validation evidence into explicit engineering decisions.

A gate evaluates whether required validation is sufficient to permit progression.

```text
Testing Evidence
       │
       ▼
Testing Gate
       │
       ├── PASS → Progress
       │
       └── FAIL → Block
```

Missing or stale evidence must never be interpreted as successful validation.

---

## Observability

The framework treats testing-system health as observable engineering information.

Important signals may include:

* failure rates;
* flaky tests;
* skipped tests;
* quarantine;
* execution duration;
* slow tests;
* CI reliability;
* gate outcomes.

Metrics exist to support engineering judgment, not replace it.

---

## Test Lifecycle

Tests are maintained engineering assets.

A typical lifecycle is:

```text
Need
 │
 ▼
Design
 │
 ▼
Implementation
 │
 ▼
Review
 │
 ▼
Execution
 │
 ▼
Maintenance
 │
 ▼
Evolution
 │
 ▼
Deprecation
 │
 ▼
Removal
```

Tests should have a reason to exist and an understood lifecycle.

---

## Governance

Testing governance defines:

* ownership;
* testing policy;
* exceptions;
* quarantine;
* testing debt;
* lifecycle responsibilities;
* framework evolution.

Testing standards should be enforceable where practical but remain proportionate to engineering risk.

---

## Official Plugin Integration

The Testing Framework applies to FamilyOS official plugins.

Plugin validation may include:

* capability tests;
* policy tests;
* rule tests;
* recipe tests;
* contribution tests;
* contract tests;
* integration tests;
* runtime validation.

Plugin-specific testing strategies may exist, but they must remain compatible with common FamilyOS testing principles.

---

## Relationship With the Quality Framework

The Testing Framework provides one major source of evidence for the FamilyOS Quality Framework.

Conceptually:

```text
Testing Framework
        │
        ▼
Testing Evidence
        │
        ▼
Quality Framework
        │
        ▼
Quality Evaluation
```

Testing does not represent the entire quality model.

It contributes validated evidence to broader engineering governance.

---

## Relationship With Engineering Foundation

The Testing Framework builds upon the FamilyOS Engineering Foundation.

The Engineering Foundation defines common expectations for:

* repository organization;
* engineering workflow;
* coding standards;
* tooling;
* configuration;
* governance.

The Testing Framework specializes those principles for software validation.

---

## Relationship With Build and Release

Testing also participates directly in future FamilyOS Build and Release Frameworks.

Conceptually:

```text
Source
  │
  ▼
Build
  │
  ▼
Test
  │
  ▼
Quality Gates
  │
  ▼
Release
```

Testing evidence is therefore part of release confidence.

---

## Normative Intent

The documents in this EPIC establish the official Testing Framework architecture.

Individual documents may contain:

* principles;
* requirements;
* recommendations;
* future roadmap capabilities.

Future roadmap items must not automatically be interpreted as already mandatory implementation requirements.

`23-Implementation-Checklist.md` distinguishes baseline and future maturity expectations.

---

## Framework Maturity

The Testing Framework is intended to evolve progressively through:

```text
Foundation
    │
    ▼
Standardization
    │
    ▼
Automation
    │
    ▼
Enforcement
    │
    ▼
Observability
    │
    ▼
Optimization
    │
    ▼
Ecosystem Scale
    │
    ▼
Quality Intelligence
```

Higher maturity must build on reliable lower-level capabilities.

---

## Validation

Framework validation is defined in:

```text
22-Validation.md
```

Validation establishes whether documented framework requirements have been translated into operational engineering behavior.

The expected progression is:

```text
Documented
    │
    ▼
Implemented
    │
    ▼
Validated
    │
    ▼
Operational
```

---

## Implementation Tracking

Implementation progress is tracked through:

```text
23-Implementation-Checklist.md
```

The checklist must be evaluated using real evidence.

Unchecked items do not necessarily indicate defects when they correspond to future roadmap capabilities.

They indicate capabilities that have not yet reached validated implementation status.

---

## Recommended Validation

A documentation-level framework review should verify at least:

```bash
find docs/epics/EPIC-TST-001-testing-framework -type f | sort
```

```bash
find docs/epics/EPIC-TST-001-testing-framework -type f -empty
```

Repository-level engineering validation should additionally execute the project's official testing and static-analysis commands.

Typical examples include:

```bash
pytest
ruff check .
mypy src
```

Exact commands remain governed by the repository toolchain.

---

## Change Management

Significant changes to the Testing Framework should consider:

* architectural impact;
* compatibility;
* repository migration;
* official plugin impact;
* CI impact;
* documentation changes;
* validation requirements.

Breaking framework changes require deliberate migration planning.

---

## Deprecation

Deprecated testing practices should remain identifiable until migration completes.

New engineering work should generally avoid adopting deprecated framework mechanisms.

Compatibility layers should not become permanent architecture without explicit governance.

---

## Contributing

Changes to this Testing Framework should:

* preserve internal consistency;
* follow FamilyOS documentation conventions;
* update affected cross-references;
* maintain terminology consistency;
* include implementation implications where applicable;
* include validation changes when requirements evolve.

A change to testing architecture is an engineering architecture change and should be reviewed accordingly.

---

## Completion Criteria

The EPIC-TST-001 documentation baseline is complete when:

* all required documents exist;
* required documents contain substantive content;
* testing architecture is internally coherent;
* cross-references are valid;
* terminology is consistent;
* roadmap is defined;
* validation is defined;
* implementation is traceable.

Operational Testing Framework maturity requires additional implementation evidence according to `22-Validation.md` and `23-Implementation-Checklist.md`.

---

## Status

EPIC-TST-001 establishes the official FamilyOS Testing Framework baseline.

The framework is designed to support progressive implementation and maturation as the FamilyOS engineering platform evolves.

---

## Final Principle

FamilyOS testing exists to create engineering confidence.

That confidence must be based on reliable evidence.

The Testing Framework therefore follows one final principle:

> Test what matters, execute it reliably, make the evidence visible, and govern how that evidence protects the platform.

This directory defines how FamilyOS turns that principle into a sustainable engineering system.
