# Testing Framework

## 11 Test Data and Fixtures

### Overview

Test data and fixtures provide the controlled inputs, state, environments, and reusable setup required to execute FamilyOS tests reliably.

Testing quality depends not only on assertions and test logic, but also on the quality of the data and environments used during validation.

Poorly designed fixtures can introduce:

* nondeterminism;
* hidden coupling;
* unnecessary complexity;
* slow execution;
* fragile tests;
* misleading failures.

FamilyOS therefore treats test data and fixtures as first-class engineering assets.

The objective is to provide tests with the minimum deterministic context required to validate behavior while preserving clarity, isolation, maintainability, and security.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of the FamilyOS test data and fixture strategy is to ensure that tests are supported by consistent, controlled, and reusable validation environments.

This strategy provides confidence that:

* tests receive predictable inputs;
* test state is isolated;
* fixtures do not hide important behavior;
* test data does not depend on production systems;
* persistent state can be recreated;
* complex environments can be provisioned automatically;
* test execution remains reproducible;
* sensitive information does not leak into test assets.

Fixtures should simplify test setup without obscuring what the test is actually validating.

---

## Test Data Principles

FamilyOS test data follows several fundamental principles.

### Deterministic

Given the same test and configuration, the same test data should produce the same expected result.

Test data should not depend on uncontrolled randomness or mutable external sources.

---

### Minimal

Test data should contain only what is necessary to exercise the behavior under test.

Large datasets should not be used when a small representative dataset provides equivalent validation.

---

### Explicit

Important test inputs should be visible from the test or clearly identifiable through well-named fixtures.

Fixtures must not hide critical behavioral conditions.

---

### Synthetic

Synthetic data should be preferred over copied production data.

This reduces:

* privacy risk;
* security risk;
* maintenance complexity;
* accidental dependency on real-world mutable state.

---

### Representative

Synthetic does not mean unrealistic.

Test data should model the relevant characteristics of actual FamilyOS usage where those characteristics affect behavior.

---

### Isolated

Each test should control the state it depends on.

Data created by one test must not become an implicit dependency of another.

---

## Fixture Principles

Fixtures provide reusable setup and teardown behavior.

FamilyOS fixtures should be:

* focused;
* composable;
* deterministic;
* easy to understand;
* cheap enough for their testing level;
* safe to reuse;
* automatically cleaned up.

Fixtures should support tests rather than becoming a second hidden application framework.

---

## Fixture Scope

Fixture scope should match the lifetime required by the test.

Possible scopes include:

* test function;
* test class;
* test module;
* test session.

The narrowest practical scope should generally be preferred.

Broader fixture scopes can improve performance but introduce greater risk of shared mutable state.

---

## Function-Scoped Fixtures

Function-scoped fixtures provide the strongest default isolation.

Example:

```python
@pytest.fixture
def family():
    return Family(
        id=FamilyId("family-001"),
        name="Example Family",
    )
```

A fresh instance is created for each test.

This should be the default for mutable domain objects.

---

## Module and Session Fixtures

Broader fixtures may be appropriate for expensive immutable resources.

Examples include:

* compiled schemas;
* static metadata;
* read-only test catalogs;
* immutable application configuration;
* expensive infrastructure initialization that can be safely shared.

Shared fixtures must not allow tests to modify state in ways that affect other tests.

---

## Fixture Composition

Fixtures should be composable.

For example:

```python
@pytest.fixture
def repository():
    return InMemoryFamilyRepository()


@pytest.fixture
def family():
    return create_family()


@pytest.fixture
def stored_family(repository, family):
    repository.save(family)
    return family
```

Each fixture should have a clear responsibility.

Deep and difficult-to-understand dependency chains should be avoided.

---

## Fixture Naming

Fixture names should communicate what they provide.

Preferred:

```text
family
configured_runtime
empty_repository
registered_plugin
temporary_config_dir
event_bus
```

Avoid vague names such as:

```text
data
setup
obj
context
thing
```

Names should reflect role and state.

---

## Fixture Factories

Factories are preferable when tests need multiple variants of similar objects.

Example:

```python
@pytest.fixture
def family_factory():
    def create_family(
        *,
        name: str = "Example Family",
        identifier: str = "family-001",
    ) -> Family:
        return Family(
            id=FamilyId(identifier),
            name=name,
        )

    return create_family
```

A test can then construct only the variation it requires.

---

## Builder Patterns

For complex domain objects, builders may improve readability.

Example:

```python
family = (
    FamilyBuilder()
    .with_name("Example Family")
    .with_member("Alice")
    .with_member("Bob")
    .build()
)
```

Builders should be used only when object construction would otherwise become noisy or repetitive.

They must not hide domain rules that the test should explicitly validate.

---

## Default Test Objects

Default test objects should represent simple valid states.

A default object should not contain unnecessary attributes or hidden assumptions.

For example, a default family fixture should not silently create:

* multiple plugins;
* persistence state;
* configuration overrides;
* events;
* unrelated entities.

Tests requiring those conditions should request them explicitly.

---

## Valid Test Data

Valid test data should satisfy the normal domain or schema constraints.

Typical valid-data fixtures may include:

* domain entities;
* configuration documents;
* plugin metadata;
* capability inputs;
* event payloads;
* serialized objects.

Valid fixtures should serve as known-good references.

---

## Invalid Test Data

Invalid test data is equally important.

It may represent:

* missing required values;
* malformed identifiers;
* unsupported versions;
* invalid relationships;
* conflicting configuration;
* invalid schemas;
* duplicate registrations.

Invalid data should be intentionally invalid in one clearly identifiable way whenever practical.

This improves failure diagnosis.

---

## Boundary Test Data

Boundary test data should represent significant limits and edge conditions.

Examples include:

* empty values;
* minimum allowed values;
* maximum allowed values;
* one item;
* many items;
* duplicate values;
* missing optional values;
* Unicode input;
* long strings;
* zero values.

Boundary data should be created purposefully rather than accidentally.

---

## Random Test Data

Uncontrolled random data should not be used as a default testing strategy.

For example, this is risky:

```python
identifier = uuid4()
```

when the random identifier is unnecessary for the behavior being tested.

Deterministic identifiers are easier to diagnose:

```python
identifier = FamilyId("family-001")
```

Randomized testing may still be useful for specialized property-based or fuzz testing, provided failures can be reproduced through recorded seeds or generated examples.

---

## Time-Based Test Data

Tests that depend on current time should use controlled clocks.

Avoid:

```python
datetime.now()
```

inside tests where time affects behavior.

Prefer an injected or fixed clock:

```python
clock = FixedClock(
    datetime(2026, 8, 7, 12, 0, 0)
)
```

This makes expected behavior reproducible.

---

## Date and Time Zones

Where date or time behavior matters, test data should explicitly include timezone information.

Tests should cover relevant scenarios such as:

* UTC;
* local timezone conversions;
* daylight-saving transitions;
* date boundaries;
* midnight transitions.

Timezone-sensitive tests must not depend implicitly on the host machine timezone.

---

## Identifier Strategy

Test identifiers should be deterministic and meaningful.

Examples:

```text
family-001
person-001
plugin-test
capability-test
event-001
```

Identifiers should avoid collisions when tests execute concurrently.

When isolation requires uniqueness, deterministic namespaces or temporary resource identifiers should be used.

---

## Personal Data

FamilyOS may process sensitive family information.

Test data must therefore follow strict privacy expectations.

Normal test fixtures must not contain:

* real names tied to real user records;
* actual addresses;
* production identifiers;
* real financial information;
* health records;
* authentication credentials;
* private communications.

Synthetic examples should be used instead.

---

## Production Data

Production data must not be copied into routine automated test suites.

If production-like data is required for specialized analysis, it must follow applicable security, privacy, and governance controls.

Such datasets must remain separate from normal source-controlled fixtures unless formally approved and fully sanitized.

---

## Secrets

Test fixtures must never contain real secrets.

This includes:

* API keys;
* passwords;
* authentication tokens;
* private keys;
* database credentials;
* production certificates.

Tests requiring credentials should use dedicated test credentials, ephemeral secrets, or controlled secret injection.

---

## Filesystem Fixtures

Tests interacting with files should use temporary directories.

For example:

```python
def test_configuration_can_be_loaded(tmp_path):
    config_file = tmp_path / "familyos.yaml"
    config_file.write_text("enabled: true")

    result = load_configuration(config_file)

    assert result.enabled is True
```

Tests should not write into repository directories or user home directories unless explicitly testing those paths within a controlled environment.

---

## Temporary Directories

Temporary directories provide isolation for:

* configuration;
* generated files;
* plugin packages;
* exported artifacts;
* local persistence;
* logs.

Temporary resources should be cleaned automatically after execution.

---

## Database Fixtures

Database tests require strong isolation.

Possible strategies include:

* in-memory databases;
* temporary database files;
* transaction rollback;
* isolated schemas;
* disposable database instances;
* containerized databases.

The chosen strategy should match the realism required by the testing level.

---

## Database Seeding

Database fixtures should seed only the records required by the test.

For example:

```text
Empty Database
      │
      ▼
Seed Required Entities
      │
      ▼
Execute Test
      │
      ▼
Validate
      │
      ▼
Discard Database
```

Large global seed datasets should be avoided because they create hidden dependencies and slow test execution.

---

## Repository Fixtures

Repository fixtures should make state explicit.

Examples:

```text
empty_repository
repository_with_family
repository_with_two_members
```

Avoid generic fixtures that silently preload many unrelated objects.

---

## Runtime Fixtures

Runtime tests may require configured FamilyOS runtime instances.

A runtime fixture may provide:

* configuration;
* service registry;
* plugin registry;
* capability registry;
* event infrastructure;
* repositories.

The runtime should be created fresh for each relevant test unless safe reuse has been explicitly established.

---

## Plugin Fixtures

Plugin testing may require fixtures representing different plugin states.

Examples include:

* valid plugin;
* invalid plugin;
* enabled plugin;
* disabled plugin;
* plugin with capability;
* plugin with malformed metadata;
* plugin with missing dependency.

Fixtures should focus on the specific contract or lifecycle behavior being tested.

---

## Plugin Package Fixtures

Some tests may need temporary plugin package structures.

For example:

```text
temporary_plugin/
├── plugin.yaml
├── __init__.py
└── plugin.py
```

These structures should be generated in temporary directories.

Shared static plugin fixtures may be used when they represent canonical compatibility artifacts.

---

## Capability Fixtures

Capability fixtures may provide:

* capability implementations;
* registered capability providers;
* valid requests;
* invalid requests;
* expected responses.

Capability fixtures should preserve the public capability contract.

---

## Contribution Fixtures

FamilyOS plugins may contribute:

* policies;
* rules;
* recipes;
* templates;
* commands.

Fixtures should include representative valid and invalid contribution definitions.

Contract fixtures should remain versioned where their format evolves.

---

## Event Fixtures

Event testing may require canonical events.

Example:

```python
@pytest.fixture
def family_created_event():
    return FamilyCreated(
        family_id="family-001",
        occurred_at=fixed_datetime(),
    )
```

Events should use fixed timestamps and identifiers unless uniqueness is necessary.

---

## Configuration Fixtures

Configuration tests should use explicit temporary configuration sources.

Examples may include:

```text
valid-default.yaml
valid-overrides.yaml
invalid-type.yaml
missing-required.yaml
deprecated-key.yaml
```

Configuration fixtures should be small enough that their purpose is immediately visible.

---

## Serialization Fixtures

Serialized representations may be maintained when format compatibility matters.

Examples:

```text
tests/fixtures/serialization/
├── family-v1.json
├── family-v2.json
└── plugin-metadata-v1.yaml
```

These fixtures should be treated as contract artifacts when backward compatibility is required.

---

## Golden Files

Golden files represent known expected output.

They may be appropriate for:

* generated structured artifacts;
* serialization;
* schemas;
* machine-readable CLI output;
* canonical documentation generation.

Golden files should be used only where exact output is meaningful.

Minor incidental formatting should not become a contractual requirement accidentally.

---

## Snapshot Testing

Snapshot testing may be used selectively.

Snapshots are useful when:

* outputs are structured;
* changes can be reviewed meaningfully;
* exact representation matters.

Snapshots should not become a substitute for precise assertions.

Large snapshots that reviewers routinely approve without understanding are an anti-pattern.

---

## Fixture Data Files

Static fixture files should be organized clearly.

A possible structure is:

```text
tests/
└── fixtures/
    ├── configuration/
    ├── events/
    ├── plugins/
    ├── serialization/
    ├── contracts/
    └── migrations/
```

Fixtures specific to one testing level may also reside close to that level.

---

## Fixture Ownership

Fixtures should have clear ownership based on their use.

For example:

* generic fixtures may live in shared test support;
* plugin-specific fixtures should remain near plugin tests;
* contract fixtures should remain near contract suites;
* migration fixtures should remain near migration tests.

Global fixture directories should not become dumping grounds.

---

## Shared Fixtures

Shared fixtures should exist only when multiple tests genuinely need the same setup semantics.

A fixture should not be shared merely to reduce a few lines of test code.

Duplication can sometimes be preferable to inappropriate abstraction.

---

## conftest.py Usage

Pytest `conftest.py` files should be scoped carefully.

A broad root-level `conftest.py` affects a large portion of the test suite and can make fixture origins difficult to identify.

Prefer localized fixture definitions where practical.

Example:

```text
tests/
├── conftest.py
├── unit/
│   └── ...
└── integration/
    ├── conftest.py
    └── repositories/
```

Root-level fixtures should provide genuinely universal test infrastructure.

---

## Autouse Fixtures

Autouse fixtures should be used sparingly.

They can create invisible test behavior.

Appropriate use cases may include:

* universally required environment cleanup;
* global prevention of external network access;
* deterministic global test safeguards.

Business or scenario setup should normally remain explicit.

---

## Fixture Side Effects

Fixtures should minimize side effects.

A fixture that:

* modifies environment variables;
* changes working directory;
* installs plugins;
* patches global registries;
* changes time;
* modifies process state

must restore the original state after execution.

Cleanup should occur even when the test fails.

---

## Environment Variable Fixtures

Tests requiring environment variables should use controlled patching.

Example:

```python
def test_environment_override(monkeypatch):
    monkeypatch.setenv("FAMILYOS_MODE", "test")

    config = load_configuration()

    assert config.mode == "test"
```

Tests must not depend on environment variables already present on the developer or CI machine.

---

## Working Directory Fixtures

Tests should avoid implicit dependence on the current working directory.

Where working directory behavior is being tested, it should be changed explicitly and restored automatically.

---

## Network Fixtures

Normal tests should not depend on uncontrolled network resources.

Tests requiring network behavior should use:

* local test servers;
* protocol fakes;
* sandbox services;
* explicit test infrastructure.

External network access may be blocked globally during most automated test execution.

---

## External Service Fixtures

External service fixtures should expose deterministic behavior.

A fake external service may provide:

* expected responses;
* controlled errors;
* timeouts;
* malformed payloads;
* retry scenarios.

The fake should model the contract relevant to the test, not attempt to recreate the entire external service unnecessarily.

---

## Fixture Cleanup

Every fixture that allocates a resource must define a reliable cleanup strategy.

Resources include:

* files;
* directories;
* databases;
* processes;
* ports;
* environment changes;
* global registrations;
* temporary plugins.

Cleanup should occur regardless of test success or failure.

---

## Yield Fixtures

Pytest yield fixtures provide a clear setup and cleanup pattern.

Example:

```python
@pytest.fixture
def runtime():
    instance = create_test_runtime()
    instance.start()

    yield instance

    instance.shutdown()
```

Cleanup logic should remain robust even if partial setup fails.

---

## Resource Leaks

Test suites should detect or prevent resource leaks where practical.

Potential leaks include:

* open files;
* background processes;
* sockets;
* database connections;
* event handlers;
* registered services;
* temporary directories.

Resource leaks can create order-dependent failures and unstable CI behavior.

---

## Parallel Execution

Fixtures must support parallel test execution where possible.

Tests should avoid:

* fixed shared file paths;
* fixed network ports;
* globally shared mutable databases;
* fixed temporary resource names;
* shared mutable registries.

Parallel-safe fixtures should generate isolated resources for each worker.

---

## Stable Ordering

Fixture data should not rely on undefined ordering.

If test results depend on order, the contract should explicitly define that order.

Otherwise assertions should compare order-independent representations when appropriate.

---

## Factory Libraries

FamilyOS may introduce internal factory utilities for frequently created test objects.

Such libraries should remain:

* small;
* domain-aware;
* typed;
* predictable;
* easy to override.

Factories should not become complex alternate constructors that bypass domain invariants.

---

## Object Mother Pattern

A centralized object-mother pattern may simplify complex test data, but it carries risks of hidden assumptions and overly broad defaults.

FamilyOS should prefer focused factories and builders unless a centralized pattern clearly improves maintainability.

---

## Property-Based Data

Property-based testing can generate broad input coverage.

Where used, generated data must be reproducible.

Failure output should include sufficient information to reproduce the generated case.

Property-based strategies should follow domain constraints rather than generate mostly invalid noise unless invalid-data exploration is the test objective.

---

## Fuzz Data

Fuzz testing may use large or random input spaces for parsers, schemas, serialization, security-sensitive surfaces, or resilience validation.

Fuzzing belongs to specialized validation workflows and should not compromise determinism of the standard test suite.

Interesting failures discovered through fuzzing should become deterministic regression tests.

---

## Test Data Versioning

Test fixtures representing public or persistent formats should be versioned appropriately.

Examples include:

* configuration versions;
* event versions;
* plugin metadata versions;
* serialized entity versions;
* migration formats.

Version labels should make historical compatibility explicit.

---

## Historical Fixtures

Historical fixtures protect compatibility with previously supported formats.

A structure may include:

```text
tests/fixtures/history/
├── v1/
├── v2/
└── v3/
```

Historical fixtures should be retained for as long as their corresponding compatibility contract remains supported.

---

## Fixture Documentation

Most fixtures should be understandable through naming and code.

Complex fixtures may require short documentation describing:

* purpose;
* scope;
* assumptions;
* supported scenarios;
* cleanup behavior.

Documentation should not compensate for unnecessarily complex fixture design.

---

## Test Data Review

Test data changes should receive the same engineering review as test logic.

Reviewers should consider:

* whether data is minimal;
* whether data is safe;
* whether data introduces hidden dependencies;
* whether fixtures are reusable appropriately;
* whether compatibility fixtures are intentionally changed.

Changes to golden or historical fixtures deserve particular attention.

---

## Fixture Performance

Fixtures can dominate test execution time.

Expensive fixtures should be identified and optimized.

Potential improvements include:

* reducing initialization;
* using smaller datasets;
* reusing immutable resources;
* selecting appropriate fixture scopes;
* avoiding unnecessary filesystem or network operations.

Performance optimization must not sacrifice isolation.

---

## Fixture Layering

Fixture complexity should reflect test level.

A typical progression is:

```text
Unit Fixtures
     │
     ▼
Integration Fixtures
     │
     ▼
Functional Fixtures
     │
     ▼
System Environments
```

Unit fixtures should usually be very small.

System-level fixtures may provision complete runtime environments.

---

## Test Harnesses

When setup becomes genuinely complex, FamilyOS may provide reusable test harnesses.

Examples include:

* runtime test harness;
* plugin test harness;
* capability test harness;
* CLI test harness;
* persistence test harness.

A harness should provide explicit operations and predictable lifecycle management.

It should not hide the behavior being validated.

---

## Test Harness Example

A plugin test harness might conceptually provide:

```python
harness = PluginTestHarness()

harness.install(plugin)
harness.start()

assert harness.capabilities.contains("communication.send")
```

The harness centralizes infrastructure while preserving behavioral intent.

---

## Test Data Security

Test data must follow FamilyOS security principles.

Controls should include:

* no real secrets;
* no unnecessary personal information;
* no production database dumps;
* no uncontrolled external access;
* safe temporary file permissions where relevant.

Security reviews may include test assets when sensitive domains are involved.

---

## Test Data Privacy

FamilyOS handles family-oriented domains that may eventually include highly sensitive information.

Synthetic data should therefore remain the default even for realistic scenarios.

A test does not need a real person's information to represent realistic domain behavior.

---

## Test Data Retention

Temporary test data should be discarded after execution.

Static test fixtures should remain only as long as they provide active validation value.

Obsolete compatibility fixtures should be removed only after their support requirements have ended.

---

## CI Environment Fixtures

CI test infrastructure should create the same logical fixture conditions available locally.

Tests should not require manual CI-only setup beyond explicitly managed infrastructure.

Environment-specific fixture behavior should be minimized.

---

## Local and CI Consistency

A test that passes locally should behave equivalently in CI when executed under supported environments.

Fixture design should prevent hidden dependence on:

* local filesystem layout;
* local timezone;
* installed services;
* user configuration;
* environment variables;
* developer credentials.

---

## Failure Diagnostics

Fixture failures should be distinguishable from behavioral test failures.

When setup fails, diagnostics should identify:

* fixture name;
* resource being created;
* configuration used;
* relevant infrastructure state.

Fixtures should fail early when their prerequisites cannot be established.

---

## Fixture Anti-Patterns

The following practices should be avoided.

### Giant Global Fixtures

A fixture that creates most of the platform for every test makes dependencies unclear and execution expensive.

---

### Hidden Test Data

Critical values should not be buried deep inside generic fixtures.

---

### Shared Mutable State

Tests should not mutate state that other tests depend on.

---

### Real Production Data

Normal automated test suites should use synthetic data.

---

### Random Everything

Randomized values make diagnosis harder when uniqueness is not required.

---

### Deep Fixture Chains

Long dependency graphs make tests difficult to understand.

---

### Autouse Business Setup

Scenario-specific setup should not happen invisibly.

---

### Fixture Logic Testing the Application

Fixtures should prepare state, not reproduce application behavior that the test is meant to validate.

---

### Uncontrolled Environment State

Tests must not depend on whatever configuration happens to exist on the execution machine.

---

### Manual Cleanup

Cleanup should be automated and reliable.

---

## Relationship With Unit Testing

Unit testing relies on small, explicit fixtures.

Unit fixtures should minimize infrastructure and provide focused domain objects or test doubles.

---

## Relationship With Integration Testing

Integration fixtures provide controlled real interactions.

They may provision:

* repositories;
* databases;
* event buses;
* runtimes;
* plugin registries.

Integration fixtures must preserve the boundary being validated.

---

## Relationship With Functional Testing

Functional fixtures provide enough application context to execute complete behavior through supported interfaces.

They should avoid exposing unnecessary internal implementation details.

---

## Relationship With System Testing

System testing may require complete disposable environments.

System fixtures should automate setup, execution context, and teardown.

---

## Relationship With Contract Testing

Contract fixtures define canonical valid and invalid representations.

These fixtures may become long-lived compatibility artifacts.

Changes to them should be governed carefully.

---

## Relationship With Regression Testing

Regression tests may introduce fixtures reproducing historical failures.

Such fixtures should capture the smallest data state required to preserve the regression.

---

## Relationship With Mocks and Test Doubles

Fixtures frequently provide test doubles.

The selection of mocks, stubs, fakes, spies, and controlled adapters is defined further in the FamilyOS mock and test-double strategy.

Fixtures should make substituted dependencies explicit.

---

## Quality Requirements

FamilyOS test data and fixtures must be:

* deterministic;
* minimal;
* explicit;
* isolated;
* secure;
* maintainable;
* representative;
* reproducible;
* appropriately scoped.

Fixture quality is part of test quality.

---

## Quality Gates

Fixture-related defects may affect applicable quality gates.

Examples include:

* nondeterministic fixtures;
* leaked resources;
* real credentials committed as fixtures;
* production data included in tests;
* broken historical compatibility fixtures.

Critical violations must be resolved before release promotion.

---

## Governance

Test data and fixture practices are governed by the FamilyOS Testing Framework and broader engineering governance.

Relevant sources include:

* Engineering Foundation;
* Testing Framework;
* Quality Framework;
* Security Architecture;
* Data Architecture;
* Configuration Architecture;
* Plugin Architecture;
* applicable ADRs;
* applicable RFCs.

Sensitive test data must additionally comply with applicable security and privacy governance.

---

## Evolution Strategy

FamilyOS test data infrastructure should evolve with platform complexity.

Future improvements may include:

* shared typed test factories;
* domain fixture libraries;
* standardized plugin test harnesses;
* runtime environment builders;
* isolated database provisioning;
* automated fixture validation;
* fixture performance profiling;
* synthetic dataset generators;
* historical compatibility catalogs;
* deterministic property-based generators;
* centralized test resource lifecycle management.

Evolution should reduce setup complexity while preserving visibility, isolation, and deterministic behavior.

---

## Validation Checklist

A FamilyOS test data and fixture implementation is aligned with this framework when:

* [ ] test data is deterministic;
* [ ] synthetic data is preferred;
* [ ] production-sensitive data is excluded;
* [ ] real secrets are never stored in fixtures;
* [ ] fixtures are appropriately scoped;
* [ ] mutable state is isolated;
* [ ] temporary resources are cleaned automatically;
* [ ] tests do not depend on execution order;
* [ ] fixtures have descriptive names;
* [ ] critical input values remain visible;
* [ ] fixture dependency chains remain understandable;
* [ ] filesystem tests use isolated temporary locations;
* [ ] database tests use isolated state;
* [ ] configuration tests control environment inputs;
* [ ] time-sensitive tests use deterministic clocks;
* [ ] plugin fixtures represent explicit plugin states;
* [ ] event fixtures use stable identifiers and timestamps where possible;
* [ ] historical fixtures are versioned where required;
* [ ] compatibility fixtures are maintained intentionally;
* [ ] fixtures support parallel execution where practical;
* [ ] resource leaks are prevented;
* [ ] fixture failures provide useful diagnostics;
* [ ] local and CI fixture behavior remains consistent.

---

## Final Principle

Test data and fixtures define the environment in which FamilyOS test results become trustworthy.

The fundamental rule is:

> A test can only be deterministic, understandable, and reliable when the data and state supporting it are equally deterministic, understandable, and controlled.

By treating fixtures and test data as deliberate engineering assets, FamilyOS can maintain fast, isolated, secure, and reproducible validation across every level of the testing architecture.
