# Testing Framework

## 20 Framework Lifecycle

### Overview

The FamilyOS Testing Framework is itself an engineering asset.

It defines the principles, architecture, standards, execution models, automation practices, gates, governance rules, and lifecycle expectations that guide testing across the FamilyOS ecosystem.

Because the platform evolves, the Testing Framework must evolve with it.

The framework cannot remain frozen while:

* architecture changes;
* plugins are introduced;
* new runtime capabilities appear;
* supported environments evolve;
* tooling changes;
* quality expectations increase;
* release practices mature.

The FamilyOS Testing Framework therefore has its own lifecycle.

This lifecycle defines how the framework is introduced, adopted, maintained, reviewed, evolved, versioned, deprecated, and eventually replaced when necessary.

The objective is to preserve testing consistency without preventing engineering progress.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to define the lifecycle of the FamilyOS Testing Framework itself.

It establishes principles and requirements for:

* framework introduction;
* framework adoption;
* framework maturity;
* lifecycle stages;
* versioning;
* compatibility;
* framework review;
* change management;
* migration;
* deprecation;
* replacement;
* implementation tracking;
* validation;
* governance;
* continuous evolution.

The objective is to ensure that the Testing Framework remains a stable but adaptable engineering foundation.

---

## Core Principle

The FamilyOS Testing Framework follows this principle:

> The framework must evolve deliberately, without allowing either uncontrolled change or architectural stagnation.

Stability and evolution are complementary requirements.

A framework that changes constantly becomes unreliable.

A framework that never changes becomes obsolete.

---

## Framework Lifecycle Model

The lifecycle of the Testing Framework can be represented as:

```text
Definition
    │
    ▼
Adoption
    │
    ▼
Implementation
    │
    ▼
Operational Use
    │
    ▼
Observation
    │
    ▼
Review
    │
    ▼
Evolution
    │
    ├── Continue
    ├── Revise
    ├── Deprecate
    └── Replace
```

This cycle continues throughout the lifetime of FamilyOS.

---

## Lifecycle Stages

The Testing Framework may move through several maturity stages.

A conceptual lifecycle is:

```text
Draft
  │
  ▼
Defined
  │
  ▼
Adopted
  │
  ▼
Implemented
  │
  ▼
Operational
  │
  ▼
Mature
  │
  ▼
Evolving
```

These stages describe framework maturity rather than software release states.

---

## Draft Stage

During the draft stage, framework concepts are being defined.

Characteristics may include:

* incomplete documentation;
* open architectural decisions;
* experimental terminology;
* evolving standards;
* limited implementation.

Draft rules should not automatically be treated as fully enforced platform contracts.

---

## Defined Stage

The framework becomes defined when its primary architecture and policies are documented.

At this stage:

* core principles exist;
* testing levels are defined;
* execution models are understood;
* responsibilities are documented;
* major lifecycle concepts are established.

Implementation may still be incomplete.

---

## Adopted Stage

The framework becomes adopted when FamilyOS engineering governance formally accepts it as the standard testing model.

Adoption means that new engineering work should align with the framework unless an explicit exception applies.

---

## Implemented Stage

The framework becomes implemented when its major requirements are represented in actual repository tooling and workflows.

Examples include:

* test structure;
* execution commands;
* CI integration;
* reporting;
* coverage;
* testing gates;
* framework validation.

Documentation alone does not constitute complete implementation.

---

## Operational Stage

The framework is operational when it is used continuously during normal engineering activities.

Operational use includes:

* feature development;
* plugin development;
* pull request validation;
* protected branch validation;
* release validation.

At this stage, framework quality can be evaluated using real engineering evidence.

---

## Mature Stage

A mature Testing Framework demonstrates:

* stable concepts;
* broad adoption;
* reliable automation;
* clear governance;
* effective gates;
* manageable test performance;
* low flakiness;
* useful observability;
* controlled evolution.

Maturity does not mean that the framework stops changing.

It means that change becomes increasingly deliberate and evidence-based.

---

## Evolution Stage

The framework remains in continuous evolution as FamilyOS changes.

Evolution may include:

* new testing levels;
* improved CI strategies;
* expanded compatibility testing;
* new performance requirements;
* improved test tooling;
* stronger governance;
* better observability.

Evolution should preserve established principles whenever those principles remain valid.

---

## Framework Adoption

Adoption should occur progressively across FamilyOS.

A possible adoption model is:

```text
Testing Framework
       │
       ▼
Core Platform
       │
       ▼
Official Plugins
       │
       ▼
Engineering Tooling
       │
       ▼
Integrations
       │
       ▼
Future Ecosystem
```

Different areas may reach full compliance at different times.

---

## New Development

New FamilyOS development should align with the current Testing Framework from the beginning.

New components should not intentionally introduce obsolete testing practices that already require migration elsewhere.

---

## Existing Components

Existing components may require migration toward current framework standards.

Migration should prioritize:

* high-risk components;
* frequently modified components;
* shared infrastructure;
* public contracts;
* official plugins.

Legacy testing debt may be addressed progressively.

---

## Framework Implementation Strategy

Framework implementation should follow a staged approach.

For example:

```text
Documentation
     │
     ▼
Repository Conventions
     │
     ▼
Test Infrastructure
     │
     ▼
CI Integration
     │
     ▼
Reporting
     │
     ▼
Testing Gates
     │
     ▼
Observability
```

Not every capability must appear simultaneously.

---

## Framework as Architecture

The Testing Framework is part of the FamilyOS architecture.

It influences:

* repository organization;
* developer workflows;
* CI architecture;
* release processes;
* quality governance;
* plugin architecture.

Changes to the framework can therefore have broad engineering consequences.

---

## Stable Foundation

Core principles should remain relatively stable.

Examples include:

* tests should be deterministic;
* tests should be isolated;
* failures should be actionable;
* important validation should be automated;
* gates should rely on evidence;
* tests require lifecycle ownership.

These principles should change only when there is strong architectural justification.

---

## Evolvable Mechanisms

Implementation mechanisms may evolve more frequently.

Examples include:

* test runners;
* CI providers;
* coverage tools;
* report formats;
* parallelization techniques;
* test-selection mechanisms.

The framework should distinguish stable principles from replaceable tooling.

---

## Principle Versus Tooling

The distinction can be represented as:

```text
Stable Principle
      │
      ▼
Implementation Contract
      │
      ▼
Tooling
```

For example:

```text
Principle:
Tests must execute automatically in CI.

Implementation:
Repository validation workflow.

Tool:
Specific CI provider.
```

The principle should not depend permanently on one tool.

---

## Framework Versioning

Significant Testing Framework evolution should be versioned or historically traceable.

Versioning helps identify:

* current framework expectations;
* compatibility requirements;
* migration boundaries;
* deprecated behavior.

The exact versioning model should align with broader FamilyOS documentation and framework governance.

---

## Version Scope

A Testing Framework version may represent changes to:

* architecture;
* normative policies;
* testing standards;
* required execution profiles;
* testing gates;
* lifecycle requirements.

Minor editorial documentation changes do not necessarily require framework version changes.

---

## Semantic Evolution

Framework versioning should communicate the significance of change.

Conceptually:

```text
Major Change
Breaking framework contract

Minor Change
New compatible capability

Patch Change
Clarification or correction
```

The precise versioning convention should remain aligned with FamilyOS standards.

---

## Breaking Framework Changes

A breaking framework change may alter:

* test directory expectations;
* required test interfaces;
* shared fixture contracts;
* marker semantics;
* execution behavior;
* CI requirements;
* testing gate policies.

Breaking changes require migration planning.

---

## Compatibility

Framework evolution should consider compatibility with existing testing assets.

Compatibility includes:

* tests;
* test configuration;
* fixtures;
* CI workflows;
* reporting;
* plugins;
* automation scripts.

Changes should avoid unnecessary repository-wide disruption.

---

## Compatibility Principle

The preferred approach is:

> Preserve compatibility where practical, but do not preserve harmful legacy behavior indefinitely.

Compatibility is valuable.

Permanent technical stagnation is not.

---

## Compatibility Layers

Temporary compatibility mechanisms may support migration.

Examples include:

* deprecated configuration aliases;
* compatibility wrappers;
* transitional markers;
* dual execution support.

Compatibility layers should have an explicit removal strategy.

---

## Framework Change Categories

Framework changes may be classified by impact.

Possible categories include:

```text
Editorial
Minor
Operational
Architectural
Breaking
```

Different categories may require different levels of review.

---

## Editorial Changes

Editorial changes include:

* spelling corrections;
* formatting improvements;
* clearer examples;
* non-normative wording improvements.

These changes should not alter framework behavior.

---

## Minor Changes

Minor changes may include:

* additional guidance;
* compatible new test categories;
* optional reporting improvements;
* new recommendations.

Minor changes should preserve existing compliant behavior.

---

## Operational Changes

Operational changes affect execution without fundamentally changing testing architecture.

Examples include:

* CI pipeline optimization;
* cache changes;
* new execution profiles;
* reporting improvements.

Operational changes require validation because they can affect engineering workflows.

---

## Architectural Changes

Architectural changes alter the structure of the Testing Framework.

Examples include:

* new test architecture;
* changed gate model;
* new lifecycle responsibilities;
* revised test taxonomy.

Architectural changes require broader review.

---

## Breaking Changes

Breaking changes invalidate previously supported testing practices or contracts.

They require:

* justification;
* impact analysis;
* migration plan;
* communication;
* validation.

---

## Change Proposal

Significant framework changes should begin with an explicit proposal.

A proposal should explain:

* current limitation;
* desired improvement;
* affected areas;
* compatibility impact;
* migration implications;
* expected benefits.

---

## Change Review

Framework changes should be reviewed according to their impact.

Review may include:

* testing framework ownership;
* architecture governance;
* quality governance;
* affected plugin owners;
* CI ownership.

Broad-impact changes require broader review.

---

## Change Validation

Framework changes must themselves be validated.

Validation may include:

* framework-specific tests;
* representative repository tests;
* CI execution;
* plugin validation;
* compatibility validation.

A testing framework change should never be assumed safe simply because it concerns tests.

---

## Dogfooding

FamilyOS should use its own Testing Framework to validate changes to the Testing Framework whenever practical.

Conceptually:

```text
Testing Framework
       │
       ▼
Framework Change
       │
       ▼
Testing Framework Validation
```

The framework should demonstrate the standards it defines.

---

## Migration Planning

Breaking or broad framework changes require migration planning.

A migration plan should identify:

* affected tests;
* affected components;
* affected plugins;
* required code changes;
* CI changes;
* transitional compatibility;
* completion criteria.

---

## Migration Phases

A migration may follow:

```text
Current Framework
       │
       ▼
New Capability Introduced
       │
       ▼
Compatibility Period
       │
       ▼
Migration
       │
       ▼
Old Behavior Deprecated
       │
       ▼
Old Behavior Removed
```

This reduces unnecessary disruption.

---

## Migration Ownership

Framework migrations require identifiable ownership.

Ownership includes responsibility for:

* migration documentation;
* implementation support;
* progress tracking;
* compatibility removal;
* completion validation.

---

## Migration Completeness

A migration is not complete until obsolete behavior is intentionally removed or formally retained.

Leaving permanent transitional infrastructure creates framework complexity.

---

## Deprecation

Framework features may be deprecated when:

* better mechanisms exist;
* behavior is unsafe;
* tooling is obsolete;
* architecture has changed;
* maintenance cost exceeds value.

Deprecation provides a controlled path toward removal.

---

## Deprecation Requirements

A deprecated framework capability should define:

* what is deprecated;
* why;
* recommended replacement;
* migration expectations;
* expected removal phase where known.

---

## Deprecation Visibility

Deprecated behavior must remain visible.

Developers should not unknowingly build new functionality on obsolete framework mechanisms.

---

## New Usage of Deprecated Features

New code should generally not adopt deprecated framework capabilities.

Exceptions require explicit justification.

---

## Deprecation Period

Deprecation periods should be long enough for reasonable migration but not indefinite.

The appropriate period depends on:

* impact;
* repository scope;
* migration complexity;
* risk.

---

## Removal

A deprecated capability may be removed once:

* replacement mechanisms exist;
* migration is complete;
* remaining usage has been reviewed;
* compatibility obligations permit removal.

Removal should be intentional and traceable.

---

## Framework Replacement

In exceptional cases, the Testing Framework architecture itself may require replacement.

Possible causes include:

* major platform architecture change;
* fundamentally inadequate testing model;
* new execution paradigm;
* severe scalability limitations.

Framework replacement requires especially careful migration.

---

## Replacement Strategy

A full replacement should generally avoid abrupt transition.

Possible strategy:

```text
Existing Framework
       │
       ├──────────────┐
       │              │
       ▼              ▼
Current Testing   New Framework
       │              │
       └──────┬───────┘
              ▼
       Transition Period
              │
              ▼
       New Framework
```

Parallel operation may be useful when feasible.

---

## Framework Review

The Testing Framework should be reviewed periodically.

Review should determine whether it remains:

* relevant;
* practical;
* effective;
* scalable;
* maintainable;
* aligned with FamilyOS architecture.

---

## Review Areas

A framework review may evaluate:

* testing reliability;
* execution performance;
* test architecture;
* coverage effectiveness;
* CI integration;
* flaky-test trends;
* reporting quality;
* gate effectiveness;
* developer experience;
* framework complexity.

---

## Review Frequency

The framework should not require arbitrary frequent revision.

Reviews may occur:

* periodically;
* before major releases;
* after significant incidents;
* after major architecture changes;
* when test-suite scale changes substantially.

---

## Review Triggers

Specific conditions may trigger framework review.

Examples include:

```text
Increasing Flakiness
Slow CI Feedback
Repeated Testing Gaps
Frequent Gate Exceptions
Large Test-Suite Growth
New Platform Architecture
```

These signals may indicate that existing framework rules require evolution.

---

## Framework Health

The Testing Framework itself has health indicators.

Possible indicators include:

* adoption level;
* compliance;
* CI reliability;
* test performance;
* flaky-test frequency;
* quarantine age;
* gate bypass frequency;
* developer friction.

Framework health should be evaluated using multiple signals.

---

## Adoption Metrics

Adoption may be measured through indicators such as:

* components using standard testing structure;
* plugins integrated with CI;
* required gates enabled;
* reporting coverage;
* deprecated mechanism usage.

Metrics should guide migration rather than become vanity targets.

---

## Compliance

Framework compliance indicates whether engineering areas follow mandatory Testing Framework rules.

Compliance may be:

```text
Compliant
Partially Compliant
Migration Required
Exception
```

The exact classification may evolve.

---

## Compliance Validation

Some framework rules may be automatically validated.

Possible automated checks include:

* test directory conventions;
* required configuration;
* mandatory CI jobs;
* prohibited deprecated markers;
* reporting artifacts.

Automation should be used where it provides reliable value.

---

## Exceptions

Temporary framework exceptions may be necessary.

Exceptions must follow the governance defined in:

```text
19-Governance-and-Test-Lifecycle.md
```

They should remain:

* explicit;
* scoped;
* traceable;
* temporary where possible.

---

## Framework Debt

The Testing Framework may accumulate its own technical debt.

Examples include:

* obsolete tooling;
* inconsistent CI logic;
* duplicated helpers;
* deprecated mechanisms still in use;
* outdated documentation;
* missing observability.

Framework debt should be identified and managed deliberately.

---

## Framework Debt Prioritization

Framework debt should be prioritized based on:

* ecosystem impact;
* developer cost;
* reliability risk;
* migration complexity;
* future architecture needs.

Shared testing infrastructure problems may justify high priority because they affect the complete repository.

---

## Documentation Lifecycle

Testing Framework documentation must evolve together with implementation.

Documentation should not describe:

* obsolete workflows;
* removed tools;
* deprecated gate policies

as if they were still current.

---

## Documentation Synchronization

Framework changes should update relevant documentation as part of the same engineering change whenever practical.

Conceptually:

```text
Framework Change
      │
      ├── Implementation
      ├── Tests
      ├── Automation
      └── Documentation
```

All parts should remain synchronized.

---

## Reference Integrity

Cross-references between Testing Framework documents should remain valid as documents evolve.

Renaming or restructuring framework documents requires updating dependent references.

---

## Framework Validation

The framework should include explicit validation of its own implementation.

Validation may confirm:

* required files exist;
* required documentation exists;
* execution profiles function;
* CI workflows execute;
* gates consume correct evidence;
* framework-specific checks pass.

---

## Validation Levels

Framework validation may occur at several levels.

```text
Documentation Validation
        │
        ▼
Configuration Validation
        │
        ▼
Infrastructure Validation
        │
        ▼
Repository Validation
        │
        ▼
Lifecycle Validation
```

The exact implementation may evolve.

---

## Release Alignment

Testing Framework evolution should align with FamilyOS release strategy.

A major framework change should not be introduced unpredictably during a critical release phase unless necessary.

---

## Release Readiness

Before a major FamilyOS release, the current Testing Framework should provide sufficient confidence for the release lifecycle.

This may require review of:

* complete automated validation;
* regression protection;
* release gates;
* performance testing;
* unresolved framework exceptions.

---

## Framework Stability During Release

Framework configuration should normally remain stable during late release validation.

Large testing infrastructure changes during release stabilization can invalidate previously collected evidence.

---

## Post-Release Review

Major releases may provide useful evidence for framework improvement.

Post-release analysis may identify:

* defects that escaped testing;
* unnecessary validation cost;
* missing regression scenarios;
* gate weaknesses;
* reporting limitations.

These lessons should feed future framework evolution.

---

## Incident-Driven Evolution

Significant defects or incidents may reveal gaps in the Testing Framework.

The response should ask:

* Why did existing tests not detect this?
* Was the correct testing level missing?
* Did automation fail?
* Did a gate allow insufficient evidence?
* Was coverage misleading?
* Was a test skipped or flaky?

Framework improvements may follow from these findings.

---

## Learning Loop

The framework should support a continuous learning loop.

```text
Engineering Event
      │
      ▼
Testing Evidence
      │
      ▼
Outcome
      │
      ▼
Analysis
      │
      ▼
Framework Improvement
      │
      ▼
Future Validation
```

This is how the Testing Framework becomes stronger over time.

---

## Developer Feedback

Developer experience is an important source of framework lifecycle information.

Repeated friction may indicate problems such as:

* unclear commands;
* slow feedback;
* confusing reports;
* fragile fixtures;
* excessive gates;
* difficult local reproduction.

Developer feedback should be evaluated alongside quality evidence.

---

## Framework Usability

A Testing Framework that engineers cannot use effectively will not produce reliable quality.

Framework usability should therefore be considered part of lifecycle evaluation.

---

## Complexity Control

Framework evolution tends to introduce complexity.

New capabilities should be evaluated against their long-term maintenance cost.

The preferred approach is:

```text
Necessary Capability
+
Clear Value
+
Controlled Complexity
```

The framework should avoid adding mechanisms merely because they are technically possible.

---

## Removing Complexity

Lifecycle reviews should identify unnecessary framework complexity.

Potential candidates include:

* duplicate test categories;
* redundant CI jobs;
* unused test utilities;
* obsolete compatibility layers;
* unnecessary configuration.

Simplification is a valid form of framework evolution.

---

## Tool Independence

The Testing Framework should avoid unnecessary dependence on any single external tool.

Tooling may change over the lifetime of FamilyOS.

Stable framework principles should survive tooling replacement.

---

## Tool Evaluation

New testing tools should be evaluated based on:

* reliability;
* maintainability;
* ecosystem support;
* integration cost;
* performance;
* compatibility with FamilyOS architecture.

Tool adoption should solve a real problem.

---

## Tool Migration

Tool migration should preserve validation continuity.

Before replacing an existing tool, FamilyOS should determine:

* which behaviors depend on it;
* how equivalent validation will be preserved;
* how reports change;
* how CI changes;
* whether historical comparisons remain meaningful.

---

## Dependency Lifecycle

Testing dependencies also evolve.

Dependency upgrades should be controlled and validated.

Testing infrastructure must not rely indefinitely on obsolete unsupported dependencies.

---

## Runtime Evolution

Changes to supported runtime versions may affect the Testing Framework.

For example, a Python runtime update may affect:

* test runner compatibility;
* typing behavior;
* dependency support;
* performance;
* fixtures.

Runtime transitions require appropriate validation.

---

## Platform Evolution

If FamilyOS expands to new platforms or environments, testing architecture may require extension.

Examples include:

* additional operating systems;
* new deployment models;
* mobile clients;
* distributed services.

Framework evolution should remain aligned with actual supported platform scope.

---

## Plugin Ecosystem Evolution

As the plugin ecosystem grows, the Testing Framework may need stronger support for:

* plugin compatibility;
* contract testing;
* plugin isolation;
* plugin certification;
* shared test utilities.

Framework expansion should preserve consistent testing expectations across plugins.

---

## Third-Party Ecosystem

If FamilyOS later supports third-party plugins or integrations, Testing Framework requirements may need to define external conformance expectations.

Potential future areas include:

* certification suites;
* compatibility tests;
* contract compliance;
* plugin validation profiles.

These capabilities should be introduced only when ecosystem maturity requires them.

---

## Framework Governance

The lifecycle of the Testing Framework is governed by FamilyOS engineering governance.

Significant framework changes should follow appropriate mechanisms such as:

* documentation changes;
* architectural review;
* specifications;
* RFCs;
* ADRs;
* release governance.

The exact governance mechanism should match change impact.

---

## Framework Decision Traceability

Important Testing Framework decisions should remain traceable.

Examples include:

* adoption of new testing architecture;
* removal of major tooling;
* introduction of blocking gates;
* major compatibility changes.

Traceability supports future architectural understanding.

---

## Relationship With Governance and Test Lifecycle

This document operates together with:

```text
19-Governance-and-Test-Lifecycle.md
```

That document governs tests, testing assets, and testing policies during normal engineering operation.

This document governs the lifecycle of the overall Testing Framework itself.

---

## Relationship With Testing Gates

Framework evolution may change the testing gate architecture defined in:

```text
18-Testing-Gates.md
```

Such changes require careful compatibility and enforcement planning.

---

## Relationship With Automation

Framework lifecycle evolution may affect CI architecture defined in:

```text
17-Automation-and-CI-Integration.md
```

CI migration must preserve required validation throughout framework transitions.

---

## Relationship With Validation

The concrete framework validation model is documented further in:

```text
22-Validation.md
```

That document defines how FamilyOS determines that the Testing Framework has been implemented and behaves according to its documented requirements.

---

## Relationship With Roadmap

Planned Testing Framework evolution is documented in:

```text
21-Roadmap.md
```

The roadmap identifies future implementation and maturity objectives.

The lifecycle model defined here governs how those objectives become controlled framework evolution.

---

## Relationship With Implementation Checklist

Implementation progress is tracked through:

```text
23-Implementation-Checklist.md
```

The checklist translates framework requirements into concrete implementation verification points.

---

## Success Criteria

The FamilyOS Testing Framework lifecycle is considered effective when:

* the framework remains aligned with platform architecture;
* core principles remain stable;
* tooling can evolve without unnecessary architectural disruption;
* breaking changes include migration plans;
* deprecated mechanisms are eventually removed;
* compatibility is managed deliberately;
* framework adoption is measurable;
* framework debt remains visible;
* implementation and documentation stay synchronized;
* framework changes validate themselves;
* release confidence is preserved during transitions;
* developer feedback informs evolution;
* framework complexity remains controlled;
* lifecycle decisions remain traceable.

---

## Final Principle

The FamilyOS Testing Framework must remain stable enough to create trust and flexible enough to survive platform evolution.

The governing principle is:

> Preserve the principles that protect quality, evolve the mechanisms that deliver them, and remove the mechanisms that no longer serve the platform.

A framework should not resist change.

It should govern change.

That is how the FamilyOS Testing Framework remains useful throughout the lifetime of the platform.
