# Testing Framework

## 14 Coverage Model

### Overview

The FamilyOS Coverage Model defines how automated test coverage is measured, interpreted, governed, and improved across the platform.

Coverage provides measurable evidence about which parts of the codebase, behaviors, contracts, architectural boundaries, and platform capabilities are exercised by automated validation.

Coverage is an important engineering signal, but it is not equivalent to software quality.

A codebase may report high numerical coverage while still containing:

* untested business scenarios;
* missing boundary conditions;
* weak assertions;
* incomplete contract validation;
* insufficient integration testing;
* unprotected critical workflows;
* uncovered failure modes;
* architectural gaps.

FamilyOS therefore treats coverage as a diagnostic, quality, and governance instrument rather than a standalone success metric.

The purpose of the Coverage Model is to identify validation gaps, prevent coverage degradation, prioritize testing effort according to risk, and provide meaningful evidence of platform confidence.

---

## Purpose

The Coverage Model establishes a consistent approach for measuring and evaluating automated validation across FamilyOS.

It provides a framework to:

* identify untested implementation paths;
* identify unvalidated behaviors;
* detect declining test protection;
* evaluate new and modified code;
* identify critical architectural gaps;
* guide additional test design;
* strengthen regression protection;
* support plugin certification;
* support quality gates;
* provide release validation evidence.

Coverage must always be interpreted together with test quality, architectural importance, and operational risk.

---

## Core Principle

The fundamental coverage principle is:

> Coverage indicates where tests execute; it does not prove that the executed behavior is correctly validated.

Coverage can answer:

```text
Was this code exercised?
```

It cannot independently answer:

```text
Was this behavior correctly verified?
```

Both questions are necessary for meaningful validation.

---

## Coverage Model

FamilyOS uses a multidimensional coverage model.

Coverage is not represented by a single percentage.

The model includes:

```text
Coverage
   │
   ├── Code Coverage
   │   ├── Line Coverage
   │   ├── Statement Coverage
   │   ├── Branch Coverage
   │   └── Function Coverage
   │
   ├── Behavioral Coverage
   │   ├── Success Scenarios
   │   ├── Failure Scenarios
   │   ├── Boundary Conditions
   │   └── Lifecycle Behavior
   │
   ├── Architectural Coverage
   │   ├── Contracts
   │   ├── Capabilities
   │   ├── Plugins
   │   ├── Integrations
   │   └── Contributions
   │
   └── Traceability Coverage
       ├── Requirements
       ├── Specifications
       ├── Acceptance Criteria
       └── Regression Protection
```

These dimensions provide complementary evidence.

---

## Code Coverage

Code coverage measures which executable portions of the implementation are exercised during automated test execution.

Typical code coverage metrics include:

* line coverage;
* statement coverage;
* branch coverage;
* function coverage.

Code coverage is useful for discovering areas that receive little or no automated execution.

It must not be interpreted as complete behavioral validation.

---

## Line Coverage

Line coverage measures whether executable lines were reached during test execution.

Conceptually:

```text
Executed Lines
──────────────
Executable Lines
```

For example:

```python
if family.is_active:
    activate_services()
else:
    disable_services()
```

Executing only the active branch provides incomplete validation despite exercising part of the code.

Line coverage is therefore useful but insufficient on its own.

---

## Statement Coverage

Statement coverage determines whether executable statements have been executed.

For Python projects, line and statement coverage are often closely related.

Statement coverage can expose:

* completely untested functions;
* unreachable implementation paths;
* forgotten error handling;
* newly introduced untested logic.

It does not prove that meaningful assertions exist for every executed statement.

---

## Branch Coverage

Branch coverage measures whether alternative decision paths have been exercised.

Example:

```python
if plugin.enabled:
    plugin.activate()
else:
    plugin.skip()
```

Complete branch coverage requires exercising both meaningful outcomes.

Branch coverage should be enabled for FamilyOS wherever practical because it provides stronger evidence than line coverage alone.

---

## Conditional Coverage

Complex Boolean expressions can contain several meaningful states.

Example:

```python
if plugin.enabled and plugin.compatible:
    activate(plugin)
```

Possible combinations include:

```text
enabled=True   compatible=True
enabled=True   compatible=False
enabled=False  compatible=True
enabled=False  compatible=False
```

Not every logical permutation necessarily requires a separate test.

Tests should cover semantically meaningful conditions rather than blindly maximizing combinations.

---

## Function Coverage

Function coverage identifies functions or methods that are executed by the automated test suite.

A function may technically count as covered even when only one of many possible behaviors has been exercised.

Function coverage therefore supplements rather than replaces behavioral and branch analysis.

---

## Module Coverage

Module-level analysis identifies areas of the FamilyOS source tree receiving insufficient validation.

Relevant targets include:

* domain modules;
* application services;
* runtime components;
* plugin infrastructure;
* built-in plugins;
* configuration infrastructure;
* capability implementations;
* persistence adapters;
* CLI components.

Completely uncovered production modules should normally trigger engineering review.

---

## Behavioral Coverage

Behavioral coverage measures whether meaningful platform behavior is represented by tests.

This includes:

* successful scenarios;
* validation failures;
* state transitions;
* lifecycle transitions;
* boundary conditions;
* recovery scenarios;
* exceptional behavior.

Behavioral coverage is generally more valuable than maximizing numerical code coverage.

---

## Positive Coverage

Positive coverage validates supported successful behavior.

Examples include:

* valid capability execution;
* successful plugin activation;
* valid configuration loading;
* repository persistence;
* successful command execution;
* valid event processing.

Positive paths are necessary but do not provide complete validation.

---

## Negative Coverage

Negative coverage validates expected behavior under invalid conditions.

Examples include:

* invalid configuration;
* malformed plugin metadata;
* duplicate registration;
* unsupported capability input;
* unauthorized operation;
* invalid event version;
* corrupted serialized data.

Critical platform components must include negative-path validation.

---

## Boundary Coverage

Boundary conditions frequently reveal defects.

FamilyOS testing should consider meaningful boundaries such as:

* empty values;
* zero;
* one;
* minimum values;
* maximum values;
* missing optional data;
* duplicate values;
* malformed identifiers;
* unsupported versions;
* large inputs;
* Unicode input.

Coverage reports can help expose untested branches corresponding to these conditions.

---

## Error-Path Coverage

Critical error handling should receive explicit validation.

Relevant scenarios may include:

* unavailable repositories;
* external service failures;
* malformed configuration;
* plugin initialization failures;
* capability resolution failures;
* lifecycle failures;
* event publication failures;
* persistence failures.

Error handling that exists only as uncovered defensive code should be reviewed to determine whether validation is required.

---

## Lifecycle Coverage

Components with lifecycle behavior require lifecycle-oriented validation.

A typical lifecycle may include:

```text
DISCOVERED
    │
    ▼
LOADED
    │
    ▼
INITIALIZED
    │
    ▼
ACTIVE
    │
    ▼
STOPPING
    │
    ▼
STOPPED
```

Coverage should include meaningful:

* valid transitions;
* invalid transitions;
* initialization failures;
* repeated operations;
* shutdown behavior;
* cleanup behavior.

---

## Architectural Coverage

Architectural coverage evaluates whether significant FamilyOS boundaries receive automated validation.

Important architectural surfaces include:

* repositories;
* ports and adapters;
* capabilities;
* plugins;
* contributions;
* events;
* configuration;
* runtime services;
* application interfaces.

High code coverage without architectural coverage can still leave critical compatibility risks unprotected.

---

## Contract Coverage

Contract coverage determines whether explicit architectural agreements are validated.

Examples include:

* repository contracts;
* capability contracts;
* plugin contracts;
* contribution contracts;
* event schemas;
* serialization contracts;
* lifecycle contracts;
* configuration contracts.

Critical contracts should have explicit tests rather than relying on incidental execution.

---

## Capability Coverage

Capabilities represent important public or internal platform contracts.

Each significant capability should be validated for:

* declaration;
* registration;
* discovery;
* resolution;
* valid invocation;
* invalid invocation;
* output compatibility;
* error behavior.

Official plugin certification should include coverage of declared capabilities.

---

## Plugin Coverage

Plugin coverage must extend beyond source-code percentages.

A plugin should receive appropriate validation across:

```text
Plugin
  │
  ├── Metadata
  ├── Discovery
  ├── Registration
  ├── Lifecycle
  ├── Capabilities
  ├── Contributions
  ├── Domain Logic
  ├── Policies
  ├── Rules
  ├── Recipes
  └── Failure Scenarios
```

The exact requirements depend on the plugin's responsibilities.

---

## Official Plugin Coverage

Official FamilyOS plugins require stronger coverage expectations.

Certification should consider:

* plugin metadata;
* declared capabilities;
* contribution registration;
* domain behavior;
* configuration;
* lifecycle integration;
* error behavior;
* compatibility contracts.

A high line-coverage percentage alone does not establish plugin certification readiness.

---

## Contribution Coverage

Plugin contributions may include:

* policies;
* rules;
* recipes;
* templates;
* commands;
* services;
* capabilities.

Declared contributions should receive validation appropriate to their behavior.

Tests should verify both contribution validity and integration with the platform where applicable.

---

## Integration Coverage

Integration coverage evaluates whether significant collaboration boundaries are validated.

Examples include:

```text
Application → Repository
Runtime → Plugin
Plugin → Capability Registry
Configuration → Runtime
Publisher → Event Consumer
CLI → Application
```

Coverage should focus on meaningful architectural interactions rather than every possible component combination.

---

## Workflow Coverage

Workflow coverage evaluates whether important complete behaviors are protected.

Example:

```text
Request
   │
   ▼
Application Service
   │
   ▼
Domain Logic
   │
   ▼
Repository
   │
   ▼
Event
   │
   ▼
Observable Result
```

Critical workflows should receive functional or system validation.

Higher-level workflow tests should not duplicate every lower-level branch.

---

## Requirement Coverage

Requirements should have identifiable validation evidence.

A traceability chain may be:

```text
Requirement
    │
    ▼
Acceptance Criterion
    │
    ▼
Test Scenario
    │
    ▼
Automated Evidence
```

Requirements may originate from:

* EPICs;
* RFCs;
* specifications;
* ADRs;
* capability definitions;
* plugin certification requirements.

Critical requirements should not depend solely on code coverage metrics.

---

## Specification Coverage

Normative specifications should have corresponding validation where applicable.

Specification coverage may verify:

* required behavior;
* prohibited behavior;
* schema requirements;
* compatibility rules;
* validation constraints;
* lifecycle expectations.

Future specification-driven tooling may automate part of this traceability.

---

## Acceptance Criteria Coverage

Acceptance criteria represent explicit completion conditions.

Important acceptance criteria should map to:

* automated tests;
* static validation;
* contract validation;
* system validation;
* documented manual validation where automation is impossible.

Acceptance criteria without validation evidence should be visible during EPIC or release review.

---

## Regression Coverage

Regression coverage asks whether known historical failures remain protected.

Each reproducible defect should normally result in permanent automated protection at the lowest effective testing level.

Regression coverage should therefore include:

* defect regressions;
* compatibility regressions;
* migration regressions;
* plugin regressions;
* runtime regressions;
* security regressions where appropriate.

---

## Coverage Across Testing Levels

FamilyOS coverage is produced collectively by multiple testing levels.

```text
Unit
   +
Contract
   +
Integration
   +
Functional
   +
System
   +
Regression
   =
Validation Coverage
```

Each level contributes different evidence.

Coverage analysis must not encourage redundant tests merely to increase numerical percentages.

---

## Unit Coverage

Unit tests should provide dense validation of:

* domain logic;
* pure functions;
* validation;
* application logic;
* transformations;
* state transitions;
* local error behavior.

Most fine-grained branch coverage should normally come from unit tests.

---

## Integration Coverage

Integration tests should validate important component interactions.

They should not attempt to reproduce every unit-level branch.

Their value lies in boundary validation.

---

## Contract Coverage

Contract tests may execute relatively small amounts of code while providing significant architectural assurance.

This demonstrates why code coverage percentages cannot represent total validation quality.

---

## Functional Coverage

Functional tests should protect meaningful user-facing and business-facing behaviors.

Their primary purpose remains behavioral verification rather than maximizing executed lines.

---

## System Coverage

System tests provide evidence about representative platform assembly.

Critical system scenarios may include:

* startup;
* shutdown;
* built-in plugin loading;
* capability registration;
* persistence;
* configuration;
* runtime lifecycle.

---

## Coverage Collection

Coverage should be collected automatically through the FamilyOS testing toolchain.

Representative commands may include:

```bash
pytest --cov=src/familyos_cli
```

or:

```bash
pytest \
  --cov=src/familyos_cli \
  --cov-branch \
  --cov-report=term-missing \
  --cov-report=xml
```

Exact execution commands should remain centralized in project configuration and engineering workflows.

---

## Coverage Configuration

Coverage configuration must be version controlled.

The preferred location should be the central project configuration where supported:

```text
pyproject.toml
```

Alternative specialized configuration may use:

```text
.coveragerc
```

Configuration may define:

* source packages;
* branch coverage;
* excluded paths;
* reporting formats;
* exclusion patterns;
* fail-under thresholds.

---

## Branch Coverage Configuration

Branch coverage should be enabled where supported.

Example:

```toml
[tool.coverage.run]
branch = true
source = ["src/familyos_cli"]
```

This provides visibility into decision paths missed by automated testing.

---

## Coverage Reports

FamilyOS may generate:

* terminal reports;
* missing-line reports;
* XML reports;
* HTML reports;
* CI summaries;
* quality dashboards.

Each report serves a different engineering purpose.

---

## Terminal Reports

Terminal reports provide immediate developer feedback.

Example:

```text
Name                                  Stmts   Miss   Branch   Cover
------------------------------------------------------------------
familyos_cli/runtime/runtime.py         120      6       34     94%
familyos_cli/plugins/registry.py         84      2       18     97%
familyos_cli/configuration/loader.py     64      8       12     85%
------------------------------------------------------------------
TOTAL                                  268     16       64     93%
```

The percentage should lead to investigation rather than automatic conclusions.

---

## Missing-Line Reports

Missing-line reporting helps developers identify uncovered code.

Example:

```text
runtime.py    94%    Missing: 84-87, 142-143
```

Each uncovered region should be evaluated.

Possible explanations include:

* missing meaningful test;
* defensive branch;
* environment-specific path;
* obsolete code;
* unreachable code.

---

## HTML Reports

HTML coverage reports provide detailed visual inspection.

They can be useful for:

* local analysis;
* framework validation;
* release reviews;
* coverage improvement initiatives.

Generated HTML reports should normally be treated as artifacts rather than committed source files.

---

## XML Reports

Machine-readable reports such as:

```text
coverage.xml
```

can support:

* CI ingestion;
* pull request annotations;
* dashboard generation;
* historical trend analysis;
* quality gates.

Generated reports should normally remain build artifacts.

---

## Coverage Baseline

FamilyOS should maintain an approved coverage baseline.

A baseline represents the current minimum accepted level of automated code execution protection.

The baseline should be based on actual project state rather than arbitrary aspiration.

It can then be improved progressively.

---

## Coverage Thresholds

Coverage thresholds may enforce minimum acceptable coverage.

Example:

```text
coverage >= approved baseline
```

Thresholds provide protection against uncontrolled degradation.

They must not become substitutes for engineering review.

---

## Global Coverage Threshold

A global threshold protects the overall project.

For example:

```text
Total project coverage must not fall below the approved baseline.
```

This can prevent major regressions.

It cannot detect every local quality problem.

---

## Component Coverage Expectations

Critical components may require stronger coverage expectations.

Examples include:

* domain logic;
* runtime;
* configuration;
* capability infrastructure;
* plugin validation;
* serialization;
* security-sensitive components.

Expectations should correspond to architectural risk.

---

## New Code Coverage

New behavior should normally introduce corresponding automated validation.

The guiding principle is:

> Newly introduced behavior must not reduce the validation quality of FamilyOS.

New-code analysis allows FamilyOS to improve incrementally even when historical modules contain lower coverage.

---

## Changed Code Coverage

Modified code should receive appropriate test validation.

A conceptual workflow is:

```text
Changed Code
     │
     ▼
Impact Analysis
     │
     ▼
Relevant Tests
     │
     ▼
Coverage Evaluation
```

Changed-code coverage can become an important pull request quality signal.

---

## Coverage Regression

Unexpected coverage reductions should be investigated.

Potential causes include:

* new untested code;
* deleted tests;
* changed test selection;
* configuration changes;
* excluded paths;
* architectural restructuring.

A coverage reduction may occasionally be legitimate, but it should be understood.

---

## Differential Coverage

Future FamilyOS tooling may calculate differential coverage for each change.

For example:

```text
Existing Coverage: 94%
Changed Lines Coverage: 100%
```

This can prevent historical coverage debt from blocking incremental improvements.

---

## Coverage Improvement Strategy

Coverage improvement should prioritize engineering risk.

Recommended priorities are:

1. critical untested domain behavior;
2. public contracts;
3. defect-prone components;
4. complex branches;
5. error handling;
6. compatibility behavior;
7. architectural boundaries;
8. lower-risk implementation details.

Coverage work should maximize validation value rather than percentages.

---

## Risk-Based Coverage

FamilyOS should apply stronger validation expectations to higher-risk areas.

A conceptual model is:

```text
Risk
  │
  ├── Critical → Strong Coverage
  ├── High     → High Coverage
  ├── Medium   → Appropriate Coverage
  └── Low      → Proportionate Coverage
```

Risk may depend on:

* business importance;
* security impact;
* data integrity;
* architectural centrality;
* compatibility impact;
* historical defect rate;
* implementation complexity.

---

## Critical Components

Components that can affect large portions of the platform deserve stronger validation.

Examples may include:

* plugin loader;
* runtime lifecycle;
* dependency resolution;
* capability registry;
* configuration loader;
* persistence abstractions;
* serialization infrastructure.

These components should not contain significant unexplained coverage gaps.

---

## Domain Coverage

Domain invariants should receive particularly strong behavioral validation.

Examples include:

* identity rules;
* state-transition rules;
* value-object constraints;
* aggregate invariants;
* domain policy logic.

Domain correctness should not depend on high-level system tests alone.

---

## Security Coverage

Security-sensitive behavior requires explicit tests.

Relevant surfaces may include:

* authentication;
* authorization;
* policy evaluation;
* validation;
* secret handling;
* sensitive data exposure prevention.

A code coverage percentage cannot independently establish security assurance.

---

## Data Integrity Coverage

Operations capable of modifying persistent data should be validated for:

* successful persistence;
* failure behavior;
* transaction semantics;
* identity preservation;
* migration compatibility;
* corruption prevention.

Data integrity failures carry higher risk and should receive corresponding coverage.

---

## Configuration Coverage

Configuration logic should include validation for:

* defaults;
* supported values;
* precedence;
* environment overrides;
* invalid values;
* deprecated keys;
* missing required values.

Configuration defects can affect the complete platform and deserve deliberate coverage.

---

## Generated Code

Generated code requires explicit coverage policy.

If generated code contains meaningful executable behavior, it may require normal testing.

If it is a mechanical artifact produced from validated sources, testing may focus on:

```text
Generator
    │
    ▼
Generation Contract
    │
    ▼
Generated Artifact
```

Coverage exclusions must not hide unvalidated business logic merely because the source is generated.

---

## Coverage Exclusions

Some code may legitimately be excluded from numerical coverage calculations.

Examples may include:

* type-checking-only branches;
* defensive impossibility branches;
* generated boilerplate;
* platform-specific code not executable in the current environment.

Exclusions should remain:

* minimal;
* intentional;
* understandable;
* reviewable.

---

## pragma: no cover

Coverage directives such as:

```python
if TYPE_CHECKING:  # pragma: no cover
    ...
```

may be used where appropriate.

They must not be used simply because code is difficult to test.

Every exclusion should have a defensible engineering reason.

---

## Dead Code

Uncovered code should not automatically receive a new test.

It may reveal dead or obsolete code.

Coverage analysis should therefore ask:

```text
Is this behavior required?
```

before asking:

```text
How do we cover it?
```

Removing unnecessary code is preferable to creating artificial tests for dead behavior.

---

## Defensive Code

Some defensive code may be difficult or impossible to execute through valid platform states.

Such code should be reviewed to determine whether:

* a direct focused test is appropriate;
* an exclusion is justified;
* the defensive branch is unnecessary.

The decision should remain explicit.

---

## Coverage and Assertions

Executed code with weak assertions can produce misleading coverage.

Example:

```python
service.execute(command)
```

without validating the result may increase coverage while providing little protection.

Coverage review should therefore consider assertion quality.

---

## Assertion Quality

Meaningful assertions should verify:

* returned results;
* state changes;
* emitted events;
* persisted data;
* expected errors;
* contract behavior.

Assertions should focus on behavior rather than incidental implementation details.

---

## Mutation Testing

Future FamilyOS quality tooling may introduce mutation testing.

Mutation testing modifies implementation code intentionally and evaluates whether tests detect the change.

Conceptually:

```text
Production Code
      │
      ▼
Mutation
      │
      ▼
Test Suite
      │
      ├── Fails → Mutation Killed
      └── Passes → Possible Weak Test
```

Mutation testing can provide evidence about assertion strength beyond code coverage.

---

## Coverage and Test Duplication

Additional coverage must not automatically mean additional high-level tests.

If a branch can be fully protected through a unit test, creating an equivalent system test solely to increase coverage is unnecessary.

The lowest effective testing level should remain preferred.

---

## Coverage and Test Pyramid

Coverage should reflect the FamilyOS testing model.

Most detailed implementation coverage should come from:

```text
          System
         Functional
        Integration
        Contract
     Unit Unit Unit Unit
```

Higher-level tests contribute broader behavioral confidence but should remain fewer and more targeted.

---

## Coverage and Regression Testing

Regression tests strengthen coverage by preserving historical failure conditions.

When a defect occurs in previously covered code, FamilyOS should investigate why existing coverage failed to detect it.

Possible causes include:

* weak assertion;
* missing input case;
* missing boundary case;
* incorrect test double;
* missing integration scenario.

This distinction reinforces that execution coverage and behavioral protection are not identical.

---

## Escaped Defects

Escaped defects should trigger a coverage-gap analysis.

Questions include:

* Was the affected code executed by tests?
* Was the failing branch covered?
* Was the scenario represented?
* Was the assertion meaningful?
* Was the integration boundary validated?
* Was the correct testing level used?

The resulting improvement should strengthen the Coverage Model.

---

## Coverage Trend

Coverage trends are often more useful than isolated percentages.

A healthy trend should generally show:

* stable or increasing meaningful coverage;
* no unexplained degradation;
* increased protection around critical components;
* decreasing uncovered critical paths.

Trend interpretation should consider architectural changes.

---

## Historical Comparison

CI or quality tooling may compare coverage between:

```text
Base Branch
    │
    ▼
Current Change
```

This allows reviewers to identify coverage changes introduced by a pull request.

---

## Coverage Artifacts

CI may produce coverage artifacts such as:

```text
coverage.xml
htmlcov/
coverage-summary.json
```

Artifacts may support:

* quality analysis;
* pipeline diagnostics;
* release evidence.

Generated artifacts should not normally be committed unless governance explicitly requires it.

---

## Pull Request Coverage

Pull request validation should provide enough coverage information to evaluate the impact of a change.

Relevant signals may include:

* total coverage;
* changed-code coverage;
* uncovered changed lines;
* affected component coverage.

Coverage should support code review rather than replace it.

---

## CI Coverage

CI should collect coverage in a reproducible environment.

The same test commands and coverage configuration should apply consistently across supported execution contexts.

Coverage results generated through significantly different test selections should not be compared without context.

---

## Release Coverage

Release validation should confirm that mandatory coverage expectations remain satisfied.

Release evidence may include:

* overall coverage;
* critical-component coverage;
* contract validation;
* official plugin validation;
* regression-suite status.

Release approval should never depend on a single percentage alone.

---

## Plugin Certification Coverage

Official plugin certification may include coverage requirements.

Certification should evaluate:

* plugin code coverage;
* capability coverage;
* contribution coverage;
* contract coverage;
* failure-scenario coverage;
* lifecycle coverage.

The plugin's risk and architectural role determine appropriate expectations.

---

## Coverage Gates

Coverage may participate in automated testing gates.

Potential gates include:

```text
New Code Coverage
Total Coverage Baseline
Critical Component Coverage
Mandatory Contract Coverage
Official Plugin Coverage
```

Gates should be simple enough to understand and difficult to game.

---

## Gate Failure

A coverage gate failure indicates that validation evidence has fallen below an accepted requirement.

The response should be to:

1. identify the missing coverage;
2. determine whether behavior requires testing;
3. add meaningful tests where necessary;
4. justify legitimate exclusions;
5. rerun validation.

Artificially weakening thresholds without investigation is not acceptable.

---

## Coverage Debt

Coverage gaps may be tracked as quality debt.

Examples include:

* legacy untested modules;
* missing branch coverage;
* incomplete plugin tests;
* absent contract suites;
* historically weak components.

Coverage debt should be prioritized according to risk rather than raw percentage.

---

## Coverage Metrics

Potential metrics include:

* total line coverage;
* total branch coverage;
* changed-code coverage;
* uncovered critical modules;
* contract coverage;
* capability coverage;
* defects with regression tests;
* plugin certification coverage.

Metrics should support decisions rather than become objectives in isolation.

---

## Metric Interpretation

The following comparison is important:

```text
95% Coverage + Weak Assertions
```

may provide less protection than:

```text
85% Coverage + Strong Behavioral Tests
```

Percentages require engineering context.

---

## Coverage Targets

Coverage targets should evolve with FamilyOS maturity.

Initial targets may focus on preventing regression.

Later stages may introduce:

* component-specific thresholds;
* new-code expectations;
* branch coverage requirements;
* plugin certification expectations.

Targets should increase only when they improve real validation quality.

---

## 100 Percent Coverage

FamilyOS does not require universal 100% numerical coverage.

A mandatory 100% target can encourage:

* meaningless tests;
* excessive mocking;
* inappropriate exclusions;
* implementation-coupled assertions.

Critical domain components may legitimately approach or achieve complete coverage, but this should result from meaningful tests rather than percentage chasing.

---

## Coverage Anti-Patterns

The following practices should be avoided.

### Percentage-Only Quality

A high percentage does not prove correct behavior.

---

### Testing Only for Coverage

Tests must protect behavior, not merely execute lines.

---

### Artificial Coverage Inflation

Executing code without meaningful assertions creates misleading confidence.

---

### Excessive Exclusions

Coverage exclusions must not hide meaningful testing gaps.

---

### Ignoring Branches

Line coverage alone can hide important untested decisions.

---

### Ignoring Critical Low-Coverage Components

A high global percentage may conceal poorly tested critical modules.

---

### Duplicate High-Level Tests

System tests should not be added solely to increase coverage.

---

### Threshold Reduction Without Analysis

Quality gates should not be weakened simply to restore pipeline success.

---

### Treating Generated Code Uniformly

Generated artifacts require deliberate coverage policy according to their behavior.

---

## Relationship With Test Isolation

Coverage results are only trustworthy when test execution is deterministic and isolated.

Flaky tests can produce inconsistent coverage measurements.

The Test Isolation and Determinism strategy therefore supports reliable coverage analysis.

---

## Relationship With Unit Testing

Unit tests should provide most fine-grained implementation coverage.

Domain and application behavior should normally receive strong unit-level validation.

---

## Relationship With Integration Testing

Integration tests contribute coverage of architectural boundaries.

Their value is determined by interaction validation rather than line percentages.

---

## Relationship With Functional and System Testing

Functional and system tests cover broader workflows and platform assemblies.

They should be scenario-driven rather than coverage-driven.

## Relationship With Contract Testing

Contract tests provide coverage of compatibility guarantees that may not be visible through code coverage metrics.

Contract coverage must therefore be evaluated separately.

---

## Relationship With Regression Testing

Regression coverage protects known historical failures.

A strong coverage model ensures defects become permanent validation knowledge whenever possible.

---

## Relationship With Quality Framework

The Coverage Model provides measurable evidence used by the FamilyOS Quality Framework.

Coverage metrics may contribute to:

* quality gates;
* trend analysis;
* release readiness;
* certification;
* continuous improvement.

Quality governance determines how these signals influence promotion decisions.

---

## Relationship With Testing Gates

Coverage requirements may be enforced through Testing Gates.

The Coverage Model defines what should be measured and how it should be interpreted.

Testing Gates define when specific requirements become mandatory.

---

## Governance

Coverage practices are governed by the FamilyOS Testing Framework and broader engineering governance.

Relevant sources include:

* Engineering Foundation;
* Testing Framework;
* Quality Framework;
* Build Framework;
* Release Framework;
* Plugin Architecture;
* applicable ADRs;
* applicable RFCs;
* specifications.

Changes to mandatory coverage thresholds or gates should be reviewed through appropriate governance.

---

## Evolution Strategy

The FamilyOS Coverage Model should evolve as the platform and tooling mature.

Future capabilities may include:

* changed-code coverage;
* automated risk-based thresholds;
* component-level coverage policies;
* mutation testing;
* requirement-to-test traceability;
* contract coverage dashboards;
* plugin certification reports;
* historical coverage trends;
* escaped-defect correlation;
* automated coverage gap detection;
* specification-driven coverage analysis.

Evolution should increase the usefulness of coverage evidence without reducing engineering judgment to a percentage.

## Validation Checklist

A FamilyOS coverage implementation is aligned with this framework when:

* [ ] coverage is treated as a diagnostic rather than a standalone quality measure;
* [ ] line coverage is collected;
* [ ] branch coverage is collected where practical;
* [ ] coverage configuration is version controlled;
* [ ] coverage reports are reproducible;
* [ ] critical behavioral paths receive explicit validation;
* [ ] negative scenarios receive appropriate coverage;
* [ ] boundary conditions are considered;
* [ ] architectural contracts receive explicit validation;
* [ ] capability coverage is evaluated;
* [ ] official plugins receive appropriate coverage;
* [ ] critical workflows receive functional validation;
* [ ] requirements can be connected to validation where required;
* [ ] regression defects receive permanent protection where practical;
* [ ] total coverage degradation is visible;
* [ ] changed code receives appropriate tests;
* [ ] coverage exclusions remain minimal and intentional;
* [ ] critical modules are not hidden by global averages;
* [ ] generated code follows an explicit coverage policy;
* [ ] assertions meaningfully validate executed behavior;
* [ ] coverage participates in CI;
* [ ] applicable coverage gates are enforced;
* [ ] release decisions do not depend solely on coverage percentage.

## Final Principle

Coverage provides visibility into the reach of FamilyOS automated testing, but meaningful quality depends on what those tests actually prove.

The fundamental rule is:

> Coverage should reveal missing validation, not become a target that encourages meaningless validation.

By combining code coverage with behavioral, architectural, contractual, regression, and requirement-oriented coverage, FamilyOS can use measurable evidence to strengthen testing while preserving engineering judgment and architectural integrity.
