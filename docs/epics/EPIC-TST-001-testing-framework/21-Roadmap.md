# Testing Framework

## 21 Roadmap

### Overview

The FamilyOS Testing Framework defines the long-term testing foundation of the FamilyOS engineering platform.

Its implementation must evolve progressively.

Attempting to introduce every testing capability simultaneously would create unnecessary complexity and make it difficult to distinguish foundational requirements from advanced optimization.

The Testing Framework Roadmap therefore defines a structured progression from the current testing foundation toward a mature, observable, automated, and governed validation ecosystem.

The roadmap is not merely a list of testing features.

It describes how FamilyOS should progressively increase testing confidence while preserving:

* development velocity;
* architectural consistency;
* maintainability;
* deterministic execution;
* practical feedback times;
* governance;
* scalability.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to define the implementation and maturity roadmap for the FamilyOS Testing Framework.

It establishes:

* implementation priorities;
* maturity stages;
* foundational capabilities;
* automation milestones;
* observability objectives;
* testing gate evolution;
* performance objectives;
* governance milestones;
* plugin testing evolution;
* long-term testing capabilities.

The roadmap provides direction without unnecessarily locking FamilyOS into specific tools.

---

## Roadmap Principle

The Testing Framework follows this roadmap principle:

> Establish reliability first, automation second, observability third, optimization fourth, and advanced intelligence only when the underlying testing system is trustworthy.

Advanced testing infrastructure cannot compensate for weak foundations.

---

## Roadmap Model

The Testing Framework roadmap can be represented as:

```text
Foundation
    │
    ▼
Standardization
    │
    ▼
Automation
    │
    ▼
Enforcement
    │
    ▼
Observability
    │
    ▼
Optimization
    │
    ▼
Ecosystem Scale
    │
    ▼
Quality Intelligence
```

Each stage builds on capabilities established by previous stages.

---

## Roadmap Philosophy

The roadmap is capability-driven rather than calendar-driven.

FamilyOS should advance when the preceding capabilities are sufficiently stable.

This avoids artificial deadlines that encourage incomplete implementation.

Progress should be evaluated through engineering evidence.

---

## Current Foundation

FamilyOS already possesses important elements of a testing foundation.

The project uses automated testing and engineering validation as part of its development workflow.

Existing capabilities provide the basis for the formal Testing Framework.

The roadmap therefore does not assume that FamilyOS begins without testing.

Instead, it formalizes, expands, and governs capabilities that already exist or are emerging.

---

## Target State

The long-term target is a testing platform where:

```text
Engineering Change
       │
       ▼
Automatic Validation Selection
       │
       ▼
Reliable Test Execution
       │
       ▼
Structured Evidence
       │
       ▼
Testing Gates
       │
       ▼
Quality Intelligence
       │
       ▼
Engineering Decision
```

This target should be reached progressively.

---

## Roadmap Stages

The roadmap is divided into eight major stages:

```text
Stage 1 — Foundation
Stage 2 — Standardization
Stage 3 — Automation
Stage 4 — Enforcement
Stage 5 — Observability
Stage 6 — Optimization
Stage 7 — Ecosystem Scale
Stage 8 — Quality Intelligence
```

These stages describe capability maturity rather than strict release boundaries.

---

## Stage 1 — Foundation

### Objective

Establish the minimum trustworthy testing foundation required across FamilyOS.

The focus is correctness and consistency.

---

### Foundation Capabilities

Stage 1 should establish:

* official testing principles;
* test architecture;
* test taxonomy;
* test directory conventions;
* deterministic execution expectations;
* isolation rules;
* test naming conventions;
* fixture principles;
* mock and test-double principles;
* regression-testing expectations.

The documentation in EPIC-TST-001 provides the architectural basis for these capabilities.

---

### Unit Testing Foundation

Unit testing should provide reliable validation for isolated application and domain behavior.

Priorities include:

* clear unit boundaries;
* deterministic tests;
* fast execution;
* meaningful assertions;
* minimal external dependencies.

---

### Integration Testing Foundation

Integration testing should validate important component boundaries.

Priority areas may include:

* persistence;
* adapters;
* runtime integration;
* plugin integration;
* configuration;
* generated artifacts.

---

### Regression Foundation

Important corrected defects should receive regression protection where appropriate.

The desired lifecycle is:

```text
Defect
   │
   ▼
Correction
   │
   ▼
Regression Test
   │
   ▼
Permanent Automated Protection
```

---

### Foundation Completion Criteria

Stage 1 is considered sufficiently mature when:

* testing principles are documented;
* core testing categories are understood;
* test execution is deterministic enough for reliable development;
* significant components have appropriate automated tests;
* regression tests are treated as permanent engineering assets.

---

## Stage 2 — Standardization

### Objective

Create consistent testing practices across the repository.

The focus moves from individual tests toward repository-wide coherence.

---

### Standard Test Structure

FamilyOS should establish consistent organization for tests.

This may include conventions for:

* unit tests;
* integration tests;
* functional tests;
* contract tests;
* regression tests;
* performance tests.

The exact directory model should remain aligned with repository architecture.

---

## Test Naming Standardization

Test naming should communicate behavior clearly.

Names should make it possible to understand:

* behavior under test;
* relevant condition;
* expected result.

Naming should support test discovery and failure diagnosis.

---

## Marker Standardization

Where markers are used, FamilyOS should define their official semantics.

Potential markers include:

```text
unit
integration
functional
system
contract
regression
performance
slow
external
```

Markers should not become arbitrary labels.

---

## Fixture Standardization

Fixture practices should become consistent across components.

Standardization should address:

* fixture scope;
* shared fixtures;
* cleanup;
* temporary resources;
* test data;
* isolation.

Shared fixtures should be introduced only where reuse provides clear value.

---

## Test Data Standardization

FamilyOS should establish common expectations for:

* synthetic data;
* factories;
* builders;
* deterministic identifiers;
* temporary resources.

Production data should not become a routine testing dependency.

---

## Standard Developer Commands

Developers should have predictable commands for common validation tasks.

Conceptually:

```text
Targeted Tests
Unit Tests
Integration Tests
Full Tests
Static Validation
Full Local Validation
```

The implementation may use scripts, task runners, or repository tooling.

---

## Standardization Completion Criteria

Stage 2 is considered sufficiently mature when:

* repository test conventions are consistent;
* test categories have defined meanings;
* developers can discover and execute relevant tests easily;
* fixture patterns are predictable;
* test data follows common principles.

---

## Stage 3 — Automation

### Objective

Integrate testing systematically into continuous integration.

The focus is repeatable automatic validation.

---

## Pull Request Automation

Pull requests should automatically execute appropriate validation.

Typical validation may include:

```text
Static Analysis
      │
      ▼
Type Validation
      │
      ▼
Unit Tests
      │
      ▼
Integration Tests
      │
      ▼
Relevant Extended Validation
```

---

## Protected Branch Automation

Protected branches should receive stronger validation than ordinary development branches.

This may include:

* full required unit tests;
* integration tests;
* contract tests;
* regression tests;
* repository-level validation.

---

## Automated Reporting

CI should produce structured testing evidence.

Reporting should include:

* execution status;
* failures;
* skips;
* execution duration;
* test artifacts where required.

---

## CI Reproducibility

CI environments should become predictable enough that failures can generally be reproduced locally.

Runtime and dependency versions should be controlled.

---

## Automation Completion Criteria

Stage 3 is considered sufficiently mature when:

* important repository changes automatically trigger testing;
* CI execution is reliable;
* failures are visible;
* reports are available;
* local and CI behavior are reasonably aligned.

---

## Stage 4 — Enforcement

### Objective

Transform testing expectations into enforceable engineering policy.

The focus is testing gates.

---

## Pull Request Gates

Mandatory testing conditions should protect pull request integration.

Examples include:

```text
Required Tests        PASS
Required Static Checks PASS
Required Reports      AVAILABLE
```

Only then should the change become merge-eligible.

---

## Protected Branch Gates

Protected branches should require successful validation.

Required checks should correspond to current source state.

Stale validation should not satisfy branch protection.

---

## Regression Gates

Critical regression tests should become mandatory validation.

Known defects should not silently reappear because regression tests were omitted from execution.

---

## Contract Gates

Public FamilyOS contracts may receive dedicated compatibility protection.

This becomes increasingly important as official plugins and shared platform interfaces expand.

---

## Enforcement Completion Criteria

Stage 4 is considered sufficiently mature when:

* mandatory testing requirements cannot normally be bypassed accidentally;
* protected branches use required checks;
* gate failures provide understandable diagnostics;
* exceptions are governed and traceable.

---

## Stage 5 — Observability

### Objective

Make the health of the testing system measurable over time.

The focus moves from individual executions toward trends.

---

## Structured Test History

FamilyOS should progressively retain useful historical testing information.

Possible signals include:

* pass/failure history;
* suite duration;
* test duration;
* skipped tests;
* flaky tests;
* quarantine.

---

## Flaky Test Observability

Known flaky tests should become explicitly measurable.

FamilyOS should be able to identify:

* which tests are flaky;
* how frequently they fail;
* how long they remain unresolved;
* which components they affect.

---

## Skip Observability

Skipped-test trends should become visible.

Increasing skip counts should trigger investigation.

---

## Performance Observability

The framework should track:

* total test-suite duration;
* major test-category duration;
* slowest tests;
* CI feedback time.

This provides evidence for optimization.

---

## Dashboard Evolution

As data volume increases, FamilyOS may introduce testing dashboards.

Dashboards may summarize:

```text
Test Health
CI Health
Flakiness
Execution Performance
Coverage
Gate Status
```

Dashboards should only be introduced when enough reliable data exists to make them useful.

---

## Observability Completion Criteria

Stage 5 is sufficiently mature when:

* testing health can be evaluated over time;
* recurring instability is discoverable;
* execution-performance degradation is visible;
* skips and quarantine are measurable;
* testing trends support engineering decisions.

---

## Stage 6 — Optimization

### Objective

Improve testing feedback speed and infrastructure efficiency without reducing confidence.

---

## Test Performance Optimization

Optimization should focus on measured bottlenecks.

Potential improvements include:

* fixture optimization;
* reduced I/O;
* improved test-data generation;
* removal of unnecessary waiting;
* parallel execution.

---

## CI Parallelization

Independent validation stages may execute concurrently.

For example:

```text
             ┌── Static Analysis
             │
Change ──────┼── Unit Tests
             │
             ├── Contract Tests
             │
             └── Documentation Validation
```

---

## Test Sharding

Large suites may be distributed across multiple workers.

Sharding should optimize execution-time balance rather than simply distribute equal numbers of tests.

---

## Selective Test Execution

FamilyOS may introduce dependency-aware test selection.

Conceptually:

```text
Changed Files
     │
     ▼
Affected Components
     │
     ▼
Dependency Analysis
     │
     ▼
Relevant Tests
```

Selective execution must remain conservative.

---

## Full-Suite Safety Net

Optimization must preserve regular complete validation.

A full-suite safety net protects against:

* incomplete dependency analysis;
* hidden coupling;
* selection errors.

---

## Cache Optimization

CI caching may reduce:

* dependency installation time;
* environment preparation;
* repeated build work.

Cache correctness must remain more important than cache speed.

---

## Optimization Completion Criteria

Stage 6 is sufficiently mature when:

* test performance is measured;
* major bottlenecks are controlled;
* parallel execution is reliable;
* selective execution reduces feedback time safely;
* complete validation remains available.

---

## Stage 7 — Ecosystem Scale

### Objective

Extend the Testing Framework to support the growing FamilyOS ecosystem.

The focus is interoperability and compatibility.

---

## Official Plugin Validation

All official plugins should follow common Testing Framework requirements.

Plugin validation may include:

* capability tests;
* policy tests;
* rule tests;
* recipe tests;
* contribution tests;
* runtime integration;
* contract tests.

---

## Plugin Contract Testing

As plugin interactions increase, contract testing becomes increasingly important.

Contract validation should protect:

* plugin APIs;
* capability interfaces;
* contribution interfaces;
* runtime contracts.

---

## Plugin Compatibility Matrix

Future FamilyOS versions may require compatibility testing across:

```text
Platform Version
       ×
Plugin Version
       ×
Runtime Version
```

Matrix scope should remain controlled.

---

## Third-Party Plugin Validation

If FamilyOS introduces third-party plugins, the Testing Framework may eventually provide a standardized conformance suite.

Potential validation areas include:

* manifest correctness;
* capability contracts;
* runtime compatibility;
* plugin isolation;
* API compatibility.

---

## Certification Testing

A mature ecosystem may introduce formal plugin certification.

Conceptually:

```text
Plugin
   │
   ▼
Conformance Tests
   │
   ▼
Compatibility Tests
   │
   ▼
Security Validation
   │
   ▼
Certification
```

Security validation itself remains governed by the appropriate FamilyOS Security Framework.

---

## Cross-Platform Testing

As FamilyOS expands, compatibility validation may include additional environments.

Potential dimensions include:

* Python runtime versions;
* operating systems;
* database implementations;
* deployment environments.

Only officially supported combinations should require formal validation.

---

## Ecosystem Scale Completion Criteria

Stage 7 is sufficiently mature when:

* official plugins follow common testing standards;
* plugin contracts are protected;
* compatibility requirements are explicit;
* ecosystem expansion does not weaken platform validation.

---

## Stage 8 — Quality Intelligence

### Objective

Transform accumulated testing evidence into higher-level engineering intelligence.

This is a long-term capability.

It should only be pursued after testing data becomes reliable and sufficiently mature.

---

## Risk-Based Test Selection

Future tooling may select validation based on engineering risk.

Inputs might include:

* changed components;
* dependency graph;
* historical failures;
* test coverage;
* component criticality;
* previous regressions.

Conceptually:

```text
Change
  │
  ▼
Risk Analysis
  │
  ▼
Validation Strategy
  │
  ▼
Selected Test Portfolio
```

Human-governed safety constraints must remain.

---

## Failure Pattern Analysis

Historical data may help identify recurring failure patterns.

Examples include:

* unstable modules;
* frequent contract failures;
* recurring fixture problems;
* CI infrastructure instability.

This information can guide architecture improvement.

---

## Predictive Test Prioritization

Future systems may prioritize tests most likely to detect problems earlier.

This capability should optimize execution order rather than silently remove required validation.

---

## Quality Trend Intelligence

Testing information may contribute to broader FamilyOS quality analysis.

Signals may include:

```text
Testing Stability
+
Coverage Evolution
+
Regression Frequency
+
Performance Trends
+
Gate Results
```

These signals may support the FamilyOS Quality Framework.

---

## AI-Assisted Testing

FamilyOS may eventually use AI-assisted capabilities to support testing.

Potential applications include:

* test-case suggestions;
* failure clustering;
* regression-risk analysis;
* test maintenance assistance;
* missing-scenario identification.

AI assistance must remain governed.

Generated tests must still satisfy normal engineering review and testing standards.

---

## AI Does Not Replace Validation

AI-generated analysis or tests must not be treated automatically as trusted evidence.

The governing model remains:

```text
AI Assistance
      │
      ▼
Engineering Review
      │
      ▼
Normal Test Validation
      │
      ▼
Trusted Evidence
```

---

## Quality Intelligence Completion Criteria

This stage should only be considered mature when:

* underlying testing data is trustworthy;
* historical information is sufficiently rich;
* automation is stable;
* decisions remain explainable;
* advanced optimization does not reduce required confidence.

---

## Cross-Cutting Roadmap Themes

Several themes span all roadmap stages.

---

## Reliability

Reliability remains the highest priority.

Every roadmap stage must preserve deterministic and trustworthy testing.

---

## Developer Experience

Testing should remain practical for developers.

The roadmap should continuously improve:

* test discovery;
* execution commands;
* feedback speed;
* failure diagnosis;
* CI reproduction.

---

## Security

Testing infrastructure must remain compatible with FamilyOS security principles.

Automation must protect:

* secrets;
* credentials;
* protected environments;
* sensitive test artifacts.

---

## Privacy

Test data and reports must respect FamilyOS privacy principles.

Synthetic data should remain the preferred testing model.

---

## Performance

Test-suite growth must not produce uncontrolled feedback degradation.

Performance should be measured throughout roadmap execution.

---

## Governance

Every maturity stage should introduce appropriate governance.

Advanced automation without governance can create unreliable engineering policy.

---

## Documentation

Testing Framework documentation should evolve alongside roadmap implementation.

The documentation must distinguish:

* current capabilities;
* planned capabilities;
* deprecated capabilities.

---

## Roadmap Dependencies

Roadmap capabilities depend on one another.

For example:

```text
Reliable Tests
      │
      ▼
Reliable Automation
      │
      ▼
Reliable Reporting
      │
      ▼
Reliable Gates
      │
      ▼
Reliable Metrics
      │
      ▼
Reliable Optimization
```

Skipping foundational stages creates weak higher-level capabilities.

---

## Prioritization Model

Roadmap work should be prioritized according to:

```text
Engineering Risk
+
Platform Impact
+
Developer Value
+
Implementation Cost
+
Strategic Importance
```

Priority should not be determined solely by technical novelty.

---

## Short-Term Priorities

The immediate Testing Framework priorities should focus on:

* completing framework documentation;
* validating the framework structure;
* standardizing repository testing conventions;
* preserving current test reliability;
* defining official execution profiles;
* strengthening CI integration.

---

## Medium-Term Priorities

Medium-term priorities may include:

* formal testing gates;
* structured reporting;
* coverage governance;
* flaky-test management;
* test-performance tracking;
* broader plugin validation.

---

## Long-Term Priorities

Long-term priorities may include:

* dependency-aware test selection;
* sophisticated sharding;
* compatibility matrices;
* plugin conformance testing;
* quality intelligence;
* AI-assisted testing.

These capabilities should be introduced only when repository scale justifies them.

---

## Roadmap and Releases

Testing Framework maturity does not need to map directly to FamilyOS product versions.

However, significant releases may establish useful milestone boundaries.

For example:

```text
Release
   │
   ▼
Required Testing Maturity
```

Release requirements should be defined by actual risk and platform maturity.

---

## Roadmap Review

The roadmap should be reviewed as FamilyOS evolves.

Review should ask:

* Are priorities still correct?
* Has platform architecture changed?
* Are current bottlenecks different?
* Has repository scale changed?
* Are advanced capabilities now justified?
* Are planned capabilities still necessary?

The roadmap is directional, not immutable.

---

## Roadmap Changes

Roadmap changes should not require the same governance level as normative testing rules unless they modify actual framework contracts.

Future priorities may change as engineering evidence develops.

---

## Implementation Tracking

Roadmap implementation should be tracked using concrete engineering evidence.

Possible states include:

```text
Planned
In Progress
Implemented
Validated
Operational
```

A capability should not be considered complete merely because implementation code exists.

It should also be validated and operational.

---

## Definition of Done

A roadmap capability is considered complete when:

* implementation exists;
* tests exist where appropriate;
* documentation is current;
* CI integration exists where required;
* validation succeeds;
* ownership exists;
* applicable governance is active.

---

## Roadmap Risks

Potential roadmap risks include:

* introducing complexity too early;
* optimizing before measuring;
* enforcing unstable gates;
* accumulating excessive CI cost;
* creating incompatible plugin testing practices;
* collecting unreliable metrics;
* adopting tools without architectural need.

These risks should be actively managed.

---

## Avoiding Premature Complexity

FamilyOS should not introduce advanced testing infrastructure simply because mature external platforms use it.

Capabilities should solve current or clearly emerging FamilyOS problems.

---

## Avoiding Testing Stagnation

The opposite risk must also be avoided.

As FamilyOS grows, testing infrastructure must evolve before existing approaches become serious engineering bottlenecks.

---

## Balance

The roadmap therefore seeks:

```text
Sufficient Capability
        +
Appropriate Timing
        +
Controlled Complexity
        =
Sustainable Testing Platform
```

---

## Relationship With Framework Lifecycle

Roadmap evolution follows the lifecycle principles defined in:

```text
20-Framework-Lifecycle.md
```

The roadmap determines where the framework intends to evolve.

The framework lifecycle determines how those changes are introduced safely.

---

## Relationship With Governance

Roadmap implementation remains subject to:

```text
19-Governance-and-Test-Lifecycle.md
```

New capabilities must receive appropriate ownership and lifecycle management.

---

## Relationship With Testing Gates

Testing gate maturity evolves according to:

```text
18-Testing-Gates.md
```

The roadmap should strengthen gates only when underlying testing evidence is sufficiently reliable.

---

## Relationship With Validation

Roadmap capabilities require verification according to:

```text
22-Validation.md
```

Implementation without validation does not constitute roadmap completion.

---

## Relationship With Implementation Checklist

Concrete framework implementation progress is tracked through:

```text
23-Implementation-Checklist.md
```

The checklist provides the operational verification layer for roadmap execution.

---

## Success Criteria

The Testing Framework roadmap is considered effective when:

* foundational capabilities are implemented before advanced optimization;
* testing reliability remains the primary priority;
* automation expands progressively;
* enforcement is based on trustworthy evidence;
* observability supports real engineering decisions;
* test performance scales with repository growth;
* official plugins remain aligned with common standards;
* advanced capabilities are introduced only when justified;
* roadmap implementation remains measurable;
* framework complexity stays controlled;
* testing maturity grows together with FamilyOS.

---

## Final Principle

The FamilyOS Testing Framework should become more capable as the platform becomes more complex.

But maturity is not measured by the number of tools, dashboards, gates, or tests.

It is measured by the reliability of the engineering confidence they produce.

The governing roadmap principle is:

> Build the simplest testing capability that provides trustworthy evidence today, then evolve it deliberately before tomorrow's platform complexity makes it insufficient.

The roadmap does not define how sophisticated FamilyOS testing can become.

It defines how FamilyOS can become sophisticated without losing control.
