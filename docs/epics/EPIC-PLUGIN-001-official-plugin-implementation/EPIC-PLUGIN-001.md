## 1. Overview

This epic defines the implementation strategy for official FamilyOS plugins.

The objective is to transform approved RFC specifications into production-ready
plugin implementations following:

* ADR-0007 — Official Plugins Architecture;
* ADR-0013 — Official Plugin Implementation Strategy;
* Plugin SDK v2;
* FamilyOS quality standards.

---

## 2. Motivation

FamilyOS has completed the specification phase for official plugins:

* Security Plugin;
* Health Plugin;
* Finance Plugin;
* Education Plugin;
* Documents Plugin;
* Communication Plugin.

The next phase is implementation.

A standardized implementation process is required to ensure:

* consistency;
* maintainability;
* interoperability;
* security;
* quality.

---

## 3. Scope

This epic covers:

* plugin implementation;
* capability registration;
* contribution registration;
* domain implementation;
* policies;
* rules;
* generation integration;
* templates;
* automated validation.

---

## 4. Official Plugin Roadmap

Implementation order:

| Order | Plugin               | RFC      |
| ----- | -------------------- | -------- |
| 1     | Security Plugin      | RFC-0010 |
| 2     | Health Plugin        | RFC-0011 |
| 3     | Finance Plugin       | RFC-0012 |
| 4     | Education Plugin     | RFC-0013 |
| 5     | Documents Plugin     | RFC-0014 |
| 6     | Communication Plugin | RFC-0015 |

---

## 5. Phase 1 — Security Plugin Implementation

### Objective

Create the reference implementation for all future official plugins.

Deliverables:

* plugin structure;
* metadata;
* capabilities;
* contributions;
* domain model;
* policies;
* rules;
* generation;
* templates;
* tests.

---

## 6. Phase 2 — Domain Plugin Implementations

Following Security Plugin completion:

* Health Plugin;
* Finance Plugin;
* Education Plugin;
* Documents Plugin;
* Communication Plugin.

Each plugin SHALL follow the ADR-0013 implementation model.

---

## 7. Technical Requirements

Every official plugin SHALL provide:

### Plugin Layer

* plugin class;
* metadata;
* capabilities;
* contributions.

### Domain Layer

* entities;
* value objects;
* aggregates;
* domain services.

### Policy Layer

* policies;
* policy sets.

### Rules Layer

* executable rules;
* validations;
* explanations.

### Generation Layer

* presets;
* recipes;
* templates.

### Testing Layer

* unit tests;
* integration tests;
* validation tests.

---

## 8. Quality Requirements

Every implementation SHALL pass:

* mypy;
* ruff;
* pytest;
* documentation validation.

---

## 9. Success Criteria

This epic is complete when:

* all official plugins are implemented;
* all plugins follow ADR-0013;
* all plugins expose capabilities;
* all plugins provide contributions;
* all plugins have automated validation;
* all plugins have official release tags.
