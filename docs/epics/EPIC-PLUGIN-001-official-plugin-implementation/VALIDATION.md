## Validation Scope

This document defines the validation contract for the normalized
EPIC-PLUGIN-001 control-document set.

The target canonical structure is:

```text
Numbered Documents: 0
Control Documents:  7
Canonical Files:    7
```

The canonical files are:

- `EPIC-PLUGIN-001.md`
- `EPIC.yaml`
- `README.md`
- `MANIFEST.md`
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `VALIDATION.md`
- `Revision-History.md`

---

## Historical Baseline Validation

The canonical repository baseline is:

```text
Tag:    v4.4.0-official-plugin-governance
Commit: d30a44f55bbac97413adc8652636ea79c96ec99f
Files:  5
```

Verified evidence:

- local peeled tag resolves to the expected commit;
- remote peeled tag resolves to the expected commit;
- the baseline contains exactly five EPIC-PLUGIN-001 files;
- the current tree matched those five files before normalization;
- no EPIC-PLUGIN-001 commits occurred after the baseline before normalization.

Result:

```text
Historical Baseline Validation: PASS
```

## Related Historical Milestone

`v2.9.0-official-plugin-implementation` resolves to:

```text
bf30ac76c7ef31e387dcbd30e7cf156323b285bb
```

The canonical EPIC-PLUGIN-001 directory does not exist at that tag.

Classification:

```text
Related Implementation Milestone: VERIFIED
Documentary Baseline:             NO
```

## Canonical Validation Gates

The normalized EPIC SHALL pass:

- YAML parsing;
- EPIC identity validation;
- seven-file deliverable contract;
- filesystem equality with declared deliverables;
- zero numbered-document contract;
- seven control-document contract;
- empty-file validation;
- placeholder validation;
- architectural-reference consistency;
- ADR-0007 alignment;
- ADR-0013 alignment;
- RFC-0010 through RFC-0015 coverage;
- historical baseline immutability;
- Ruff;
- MyPy;
- Pytest;
- `git diff --check`.

## Current Validation State

The historical baseline checks have passed.

The normalized seven-file repository state has completed the full
post-normalization revalidation workflow.

```text
Historical Baseline:        PASS
Canonical Structure:        PASS
YAML Contract:              PASS
Filesystem Contract:        PASS
Control Document Alignment: PASS
Architecture Consistency:   PASS
Repository Quality Gates:   PASS
Repository Validation:      Validated
Final Validation:           Validated
EPIC Closure:               Closed
```

Final closure is recorded because the normalized repository state
has been validated, committed, pushed, remotely verified, and confirmed with a
clean working tree.

## Final Decision

```text
EPIC-PLUGIN-001 REVALIDATION: PASS
```
