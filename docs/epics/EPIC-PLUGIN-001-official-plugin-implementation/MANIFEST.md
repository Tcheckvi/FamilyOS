## Historical Baseline

The canonical repository baseline for this EPIC directory is:

- Tag: `v4.4.0-official-plugin-governance`
- Commit: `d30a44f55bbac97413adc8652636ea79c96ec99f`
- Historical files: 5

`v2.9.0-official-plugin-implementation` is a related implementation milestone,
but the canonical EPIC-PLUGIN-001 directory did not exist at that tag.
