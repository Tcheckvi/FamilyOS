## 1. Overview

EPIC-ENG-001 establishes the canonical Engineering Foundation for FamilyOS.

The Engineering Foundation defines the shared engineering operating model used across the FamilyOS ecosystem.

It establishes the principles, repository expectations, development practices, coding standards, lifecycle rules, governance model, validation requirements, and framework boundaries required for FamilyOS software to evolve in a consistent, maintainable, traceable, testable, and sustainable manner.

The Engineering Foundation does not replace specialized engineering frameworks.

Instead, it provides the common baseline from which those frameworks extend FamilyOS engineering capability.

---

## 2. Purpose

The purpose of EPIC-ENG-001 is to establish a durable engineering foundation for FamilyOS.

The EPIC defines:

* engineering context;
* engineering vision;
* engineering principles;
* repository architecture;
* development workflow;
* coding standards;
* project structure;
* toolchain expectations;
* environment management;
* dependency management;
* configuration management;
* build philosophy;
* testing philosophy;
* documentation philosophy;
* quality philosophy;
* technical governance;
* engineering lifecycle;
* roadmap;
* references;
* validation;
* release preparation;
* implementation closure.

The Engineering Foundation provides a common operating model without duplicating detailed specialized framework architecture.

---

## 3. Engineering Mission

FamilyOS requires an engineering model capable of supporting long-term platform evolution.

The Engineering Foundation therefore aims to ensure that FamilyOS engineering remains:

* explicit;
* reviewable;
* testable;
* reproducible;
* maintainable;
* secure-aware;
* traceable;
* modular;
* governed;
* evidence-driven;
* sustainable.

Engineering decisions SHOULD remain understandable long after their original implementation.

Engineering practices MUST support both current implementation requirements and future platform evolution.

---

## 4. Engineering Objectives

EPIC-ENG-001 establishes the following core objectives.

### 4.1 Consistent Engineering Practices

FamilyOS engineering practices MUST follow common expectations across repositories, frameworks, plugins, and platform capabilities.

---

### 4.2 Architectural Discipline

Architecture MUST remain explicit.

Major implementation decisions SHOULD follow architectural intent rather than short-term convenience.

---

### 4.3 Maintainability

Engineering decisions MUST support long-term maintainability.

The repository SHOULD remain understandable to future contributors without requiring undocumented tribal knowledge.

---

### 4.4 Testability

Software SHOULD be designed so that meaningful behavior can be validated through automated testing.

---

### 4.5 Type Safety

Production source code SHOULD use strong typing where appropriate.

Static type validation is part of the FamilyOS repository quality model.

---

### 4.6 Traceability

Significant engineering decisions, changes, releases, and validation outcomes MUST remain traceable.

---

### 4.7 Reproducibility

Development, build, validation, and release processes SHOULD minimize hidden environmental assumptions.

---

### 4.8 Sustainable Evolution

Engineering practices MUST support continued platform evolution without uncontrolled architectural degradation.

---

## 5. Canonical Scope

## 6. Scope Boundaries

EPIC-ENG-001 defines shared engineering expectations.

It does not own every detailed engineering concern.

Specialized capabilities remain governed by dedicated FamilyOS frameworks.

The Engineering Foundation MUST avoid unnecessary duplication of those frameworks.

---

## 7. Canonical Repository Structure

The canonical EPIC-ENG-001 repository structure consists of:

```text
24 numbered documents
7 control documents
31 canonical files
```

Canonical numbered range:

```text
00-23
```

---

```

---

## 10. Canonical File Count

Final canonical inventory:

| Category           | Count |
| ------------------ | ----: |
| Numbered documents |    24 |
| Control documents  |     7 |
| Canonical files    |    31 |

Result:

```text
PASS
```

---

## 11. Context Normalization

`01-Context.md` is the canonical Engineering Foundation context document.

The obsolete duplicate:

```text
01-Introduction.md
```

has been removed from the canonical structure.

Historical references to the obsolete file are permitted only when they explicitly document its removal or previous repository state.

Active Engineering Foundation navigation MUST use:

```text
01-Context.md
```

---

## 12. Engineering Principles

The Engineering Foundation establishes shared principles for FamilyOS engineering.

Core expectations include:

* architecture before uncontrolled implementation;
* explicit contracts;
* separation of concerns;
* controlled dependency direction;
* validation as part of engineering;
* documentation as an engineering artifact;
* traceable decisions;
* reproducible processes;
* sustainable evolution;
* evidence-based quality.

These principles apply across FamilyOS engineering work unless a stronger specialized framework requirement applies.

---

## 13. Repository Architecture

The repository architecture SHOULD make engineering intent visible.

FamilyOS repositories SHOULD clearly separate:

* source code;
* tests;
* documentation;
* configuration;
* automation;
* governance artifacts;
* build-related files;
* release-related files.

Repository structure MUST support maintainability and discoverability.

Architectural boundaries SHOULD be reflected in project organization.

---

## 14. Development Workflow

FamilyOS development follows a controlled engineering lifecycle.

A typical change progresses through:

```text
Need
  │
  ▼
Analysis
  │
  ▼
Design
  │
  ▼
Implementation
  │
  ▼
Validation
  │
  ▼
Review
  │
  ▼
Integration
  │
  ▼
Release
  │
  ▼
Maintenance
```

Not every change requires identical ceremony.

However, the level of engineering control SHOULD remain proportional to the impact and risk of the change.

---

## 15. Coding Standards

FamilyOS code SHOULD prioritize:

* readability;
* maintainability;
* explicit behavior;
* meaningful naming;
* strong typing;
* testability;
* predictable error handling;
* clear dependencies;
* minimal unnecessary complexity.

Code SHOULD avoid hidden behavior where explicit behavior is practical.

---

## 16. Type Safety

Static typing is part of the FamilyOS engineering quality model.

The canonical repository-wide production-source MyPy command is:

```bash
mypy src
```

Final validation result:

```text
Success: no issues found in 527 source files
```

Status:

```text
PASS
```

---

## 17. Ruff Validation

Ruff provides repository-wide linting validation.

Canonical command:

```bash
ruff check .
```

Final result:

```text
All checks passed!
```

Status:

```text
PASS
```

---

## 18. Pytest Validation

Pytest provides automated behavioral validation.

Canonical command:

```bash
pytest -q
```

Final result:

```text
1243 passed in 1.03s
```

Status:

```text
PASS
```

---

## 19. Diff Validation

Repository diff integrity is validated using:

```bash
git diff --check
```

Final result:

```text
PASS
```

No whitespace errors or conflict markers were detected.

---

## 20. Project Structure

Project structure SHOULD communicate architectural intent.

Packages and modules SHOULD be organized around meaningful responsibilities.

FamilyOS SHOULD avoid repository structures that obscure:

* domain boundaries;
* plugin boundaries;
* framework boundaries;
* public interfaces;
* internal implementation details.

Repository organization MUST remain understandable as the platform grows.

---

## 21. Toolchain

The Engineering Foundation identifies core engineering validation tools.

Current repository quality tooling includes:

```text
Ruff
MyPy
Pytest
Git
Python
```

Specialized frameworks MAY extend the toolchain.

The Engineering Foundation defines shared expectations rather than every tool-specific policy.

---

## 22. Environment Management

Development environments SHOULD remain reproducible.

Environment management SHOULD minimize differences between contributors and validation environments.

Python environments SHOULD use dependency isolation.

Configuration SHOULD remain explicit.

Environment-specific assumptions SHOULD be documented when they materially affect engineering behavior.

---

## 23. Dependency Management

Dependencies MUST be introduced deliberately.

Dependency selection SHOULD evaluate:

* necessity;
* maintenance health;
* compatibility;
* architectural impact;
* security implications;
* operational impact;
* licensing implications where relevant.

Unnecessary dependencies SHOULD be avoided.

---

## 24. Configuration Management

Configuration MUST remain explicit and reviewable.

Where appropriate:

* code and configuration SHOULD remain separated;
* environment-specific values SHOULD remain controlled;
* secrets MUST NOT be treated as ordinary repository configuration;
* configuration changes SHOULD remain traceable.

Detailed secrets and security governance belong to specialized security architecture.

---

## 25. Build Philosophy

EPIC-ENG-001 defines the shared expectation that builds SHOULD be:

* reproducible;
* deterministic where practical;
* observable;
* validated;
* traceable.

Detailed build architecture belongs to:

```text
EPIC-BLD-001 — Build Framework
```

EPIC-ENG-001 does not duplicate the Build Framework.

---

## 26. Testing Philosophy

Testing is part of engineering, not a post-implementation activity.

FamilyOS SHOULD design behavior so that it can be validated.

Testing SHOULD support:

* regression protection;
* architecture confidence;
* integration confidence;
* maintainability;
* safe evolution.

Detailed testing architecture, levels, automation, evidence, and governance belong to:

```text
EPIC-TST-001 — Testing Framework
```

---

## 27. Documentation Philosophy

Documentation is an engineering artifact.

Engineering documentation SHOULD:

* explain intent;
* preserve decisions;
* expose contracts;
* describe governance;
* support future maintenance;
* remain synchronized with the system.

Documentation that materially affects engineering behavior MUST remain reviewable.

---

## 28. Quality Philosophy

Quality is a continuous engineering responsibility.

Quality SHOULD be:

* designed;
* validated;
* measurable where meaningful;
* evidence-driven;
* continuously maintained.

Detailed quality architecture, evidence, metrics, gates, risk, and governance belong to:

```text
EPIC-QLT-001 — Quality Framework
```

---

## 29. Technical Governance

Engineering decisions vary in impact.

FamilyOS governance SHOULD distinguish between:

* strategic decisions;
* architectural decisions;
* engineering decisions;
* implementation decisions.

Higher-impact decisions require stronger review and traceability.

Exceptions to established engineering rules SHOULD be explicit and justified.

---

## 30. Engineering Lifecycle

The Engineering Foundation defines the shared engineering lifecycle:

```text
Need Identification
      │
      ▼
Analysis
      │
      ▼
Design
      │
      ▼
Implementation
      │
      ▼
Validation
      │
      ▼
Integration
      │
      ▼
Release
      │
      ▼
Maintenance
      │
      ▼
Continuous Evolution
```

The lifecycle provides a conceptual operating model.

Specialized frameworks MAY define more detailed lifecycle states.

---
