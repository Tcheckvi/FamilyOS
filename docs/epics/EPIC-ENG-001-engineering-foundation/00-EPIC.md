## 1. Overview

EPIC-ENG-001 establishes the canonical Engineering Foundation for FamilyOS.

It defines the shared engineering operating model required for the consistent, maintainable, testable, traceable, governed, and sustainable evolution of the FamilyOS platform.

The Engineering Foundation provides the baseline upon which specialized FamilyOS engineering frameworks operate.

It does not replace those frameworks.

Instead, it establishes the common principles, responsibilities, repository expectations, lifecycle rules, validation requirements, and governance boundaries that specialized frameworks extend.

---

## 2. Purpose

The purpose of EPIC-ENG-001 is to establish a durable engineering foundation for FamilyOS.

The Engineering Foundation defines:

* engineering context;
* engineering vision;
* engineering principles;
* repository architecture;
* development workflow;
* coding standards;
* project structure;
* toolchain expectations;
* environment management;
* dependency management;
* configuration management;
* build philosophy;
* testing philosophy;
* documentation philosophy;
* quality philosophy;
* technical governance;
* engineering lifecycle;
* roadmap;
* references;
* validation;
* summary;
* release model;
* implementation checklist.

The Engineering Foundation provides shared engineering expectations while delegating specialized responsibilities to dedicated FamilyOS frameworks.

---

## 3. Engineering Mission

FamilyOS requires an engineering model capable of supporting long-term platform evolution without uncontrolled complexity.

The Engineering Foundation therefore establishes a shared mission:

```text
Build FamilyOS through explicit architecture,
disciplined engineering,
continuous validation,
traceable decisions,
controlled evolution,
and sustainable technical governance.
```

Engineering practices SHOULD preserve long-term understanding.

Engineering changes MUST remain reviewable and verifiable.

Engineering decisions SHOULD support future maintainers, contributors, and platform evolution.

---

## 4. Engineering Objectives

The Engineering Foundation establishes the following objectives.

### 4.1 Architectural Consistency

FamilyOS architecture MUST remain explicit and understandable.

Implementation SHOULD follow architectural intent rather than bypass it.

---

### 4.2 Maintainability

Engineering decisions MUST support long-term maintainability.

Repository structure, code organization, documentation, and governance SHOULD reduce hidden knowledge.

---

### 4.3 Testability

FamilyOS software SHOULD be designed so that meaningful behavior can be validated through automated tests.

---

### 4.4 Type Safety

Production source code SHOULD use strong typing where appropriate.

Static type validation is part of repository quality validation.

---

### 4.5 Traceability

Significant engineering decisions and repository states MUST remain traceable.

---

### 4.6 Reproducibility

Engineering processes SHOULD minimize hidden environmental dependencies.

Builds, tests, validations, and releases SHOULD be reproducible where practical.

---

### 4.7 Sustainable Evolution

Engineering practices MUST support continuous evolution without uncontrolled architectural degradation.

---

## 5. Canonical Engineering Structure

The Engineering Foundation consists of:

```text
24 numbered documents
7 control documents
31 canonical files
```

Canonical numbered range:

```text
00-23
```

---

## 6. Canonical Numbered Documents

## 8. Canonical Repository Inventory

Final inventory:

| Category           | Expected |  Actual | Result |
| ------------------ | -------: | ------: | ------ |
| Numbered documents |       24 |      24 | ✅ PASS |
| Control documents  |        7 |       7 | ✅ PASS |
| Canonical files    |       31 |      31 | ✅ PASS |
| Canonical range    |  `00-23` | `00-23` | ✅ PASS |

Additional checks:

* no missing canonical files;
* no unexpected numbered documents;
* no empty canonical files;
* no abnormal small canonical files;
* canonical numbering is continuous;
* all declared deliverables are present.

Result:

```text
Canonical Structure: PASS
```

---

## 9. Context Document Normalization

The canonical context document is:

```text
01-Context.md
```

The obsolete duplicate:

```text
01-Introduction.md
```

has been removed from the canonical structure.

Historical references remain permitted only when they explicitly document the prior repository state or the removal of the obsolete document.

Active canonical references MUST use `01-Context.md`.

---

## 10. Engineering Principles

The Engineering Foundation establishes shared FamilyOS engineering principles.

These include:

* architecture before uncontrolled implementation;
* explicit contracts;
* clear separation of concerns;
* controlled dependency direction;
* validation as part of engineering;
* documentation as an engineering artifact;
* traceable decisions;
* reproducible processes;
* sustainable evolution;
* evidence-based quality;
* governed technical change.

These principles apply unless a stronger specialized framework requirement exists.

---

## 11. Repository Architecture

FamilyOS repositories SHOULD make architectural intent visible.

Repositories SHOULD clearly separate:

* production source code;
* tests;
* documentation;
* configuration;
* automation;
* governance artifacts;
* build-related artifacts;
* release-related artifacts.

Repository structure MUST remain maintainable and discoverable as the platform evolves.

---

## 12. Development Workflow

FamilyOS development follows a controlled engineering workflow.

Typical progression:

```text
Need Identification
      │
      ▼
Analysis
      │
      ▼
Design
      │
      ▼
Implementation
      │
      ▼
Validation
      │
      ▼
Review
      │
      ▼
Integration
      │
      ▼
Release
      │
      ▼
Maintenance
      │
      ▼
Continuous Evolution
```

The amount of process SHOULD remain proportional to the impact and risk of the change.

---

## 13. Coding Standards

FamilyOS code SHOULD prioritize:

* readability;
* maintainability;
* explicit behavior;
* meaningful naming;
* strong typing;
* predictable error handling;
* testability;
* dependency discipline;
* minimal unnecessary complexity.

Engineering code SHOULD remain understandable without relying on undocumented assumptions.

---

## 14. Project Structure

Project structure SHOULD communicate architectural intent.

Packages and modules SHOULD be organized around meaningful responsibilities.

FamilyOS SHOULD avoid structures that obscure:

* domain boundaries;
* plugin boundaries;
* framework boundaries;
* public interfaces;
* internal implementation details.

---

## 15. Toolchain

The Engineering Foundation recognizes core repository engineering tools including:

```text
Python
Ruff
MyPy
Pytest
Git
```

Specialized frameworks MAY extend this toolchain.

The Engineering Foundation defines the common engineering expectations around tool usage and validation.

---

## 16. Environment Management

Development environments SHOULD remain reproducible.

Environment management SHOULD support:

* dependency isolation;
* explicit configuration;
* predictable validation;
* consistent developer behavior;
* reduced machine-specific assumptions.

Environment-specific constraints SHOULD be documented when they materially affect engineering behavior.

---

## 17. Dependency Management

Dependencies MUST be introduced deliberately.

Dependency selection SHOULD consider:

* necessity;
* maintainability;
* compatibility;
* security impact;
* architectural impact;
* operational impact;
* licensing constraints where relevant.

Unnecessary dependencies SHOULD be avoided.

---

## 18. Configuration Management

Configuration MUST remain explicit and reviewable.

Where appropriate:

* configuration SHOULD remain separate from implementation logic;
* environment-specific values SHOULD remain controlled;
* secrets MUST NOT be treated as ordinary repository configuration;
* configuration changes SHOULD remain traceable.

Detailed security governance remains owned by specialized security architecture.

---

## 19. Build Philosophy

EPIC-ENG-001 defines shared build expectations.

Builds SHOULD be:

* reproducible;
* deterministic where practical;
* traceable;
* observable;
* validated.

Detailed build architecture belongs to:

```text
EPIC-BLD-001 — Build Framework
```

---

## 20. Testing Philosophy

Testing is part of engineering.

FamilyOS software SHOULD be designed for meaningful automated validation.

Testing SHOULD support:

* regression protection;
* maintainability;
* safe evolution;
* integration confidence;
* architectural confidence.

Detailed testing architecture belongs to:

```text
EPIC-TST-001 — Testing Framework
```

---

## 21. Documentation Philosophy

Documentation is an engineering artifact.

Documentation SHOULD:

* explain engineering intent;
* preserve important decisions;
* expose contracts;
* support governance;
* remain synchronized with implementation;
* support future maintainers.

Documentation that materially affects engineering behavior MUST remain reviewable.

---

## 22. Quality Philosophy

Quality is a continuous engineering responsibility.

FamilyOS quality SHOULD be:

* designed;
* validated;
* evidence-based;
* measurable where meaningful;
* continuously maintained.

Detailed quality architecture belongs to:

```text
EPIC-QLT-001 — Quality Framework
```

---

## 23. Technical Governance

Technical governance distinguishes between different levels of engineering decision.

Examples include:

* strategic decisions;
* architectural decisions;
* engineering decisions;
* implementation decisions.

Higher-impact decisions require stronger review and traceability.

Exceptions to established engineering requirements SHOULD be explicit and justified.

---

## 24. Engineering Lifecycle

The shared Engineering Foundation lifecycle includes:

```text
Need Identification
Analysis
Design
Implementation
Validation
Integration
Release
Maintenance
Continuous Evolution
```

Specialized frameworks MAY define more detailed lifecycle states.

---

## 25. Specialized Framework Boundaries

EPIC-ENG-001 establishes common engineering expectations.
