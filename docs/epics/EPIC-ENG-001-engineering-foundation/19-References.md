# 19 References

## Context

The FamilyOS Engineering Foundation exists as part of a larger engineering ecosystem.

Multiple frameworks, specifications, architectural documents, and governance artifacts contribute to the overall engineering model.

This document identifies the authoritative references connected to the Engineering Foundation and defines how they relate to one another.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this reference document is to provide:

* navigation between engineering artifacts;
* traceability between frameworks;
* relationship visibility;
* documentation alignment;
* reference authority.

Referenced documents remain the authoritative sources for their respective domains.

---

## Reference Classification

Engineering references are divided into two categories.

### Normative References

Normative references define mandatory engineering rules, requirements, or governance.

They establish the official engineering baseline.

Examples include:

* Engineering Foundation
* Architecture Documents
* ADRs
* RFCs
* Specifications
* Engineering Frameworks

---

### Informative References

Informative references provide additional context, guidance, examples, or background information.

They support engineering understanding but do not establish mandatory requirements.

---

## Normative Reference Hierarchy

When multiple documents address the same engineering topic, the following precedence applies.

```text
FamilyOS Foundation
        │
        ▼
Architecture Documents
        │
        ▼
Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
        │
        ▼
Specifications (SPEC)
        │
        ▼
Request for Comments (RFC)
        │
        ▼
Engineering Foundation
        │
        ▼
Engineering Frameworks
        │
        ▼
Guides and Supporting Documentation
```

Lower-level documents must not contradict higher-level engineering authority.

## Engineering Reference Model

The engineering ecosystem can be represented as follows.

```text
FamilyOS Foundation
        │
        ▼
Engineering Foundation
        │
        ├── Architecture
        ├── Documentation
        ├── Testing
        ├── Quality
        ├── Build
        ├── Release
        └── Plugin Architecture
```

This model illustrates how engineering disciplines relate to the Engineering Foundation while remaining specialized frameworks.

---

## Reference Maintenance

Engineering references should remain:

* accurate;
* discoverable;
* versioned;
* synchronized.

Broken or outdated references reduce engineering confidence and knowledge quality.

---

## Reference Governance

Reference changes follow Technical Governance.

Changes affecting engineering relationships should be:

* reviewed;
* documented;
* traceable.

Major structural changes may require:

* ADR;
* RFC;
* documentation updates.

---

## Success Criteria

The reference model is successful when:

* contributors can navigate engineering knowledge efficiently;
* authoritative sources are clearly identifiable;
* relationships between frameworks remain consistent;
* documentation remains synchronized.

---

## Final Statement

The Engineering Foundation reference model establishes the authoritative relationships between engineering artifacts across FamilyOS.

By defining reference hierarchy, governance, and traceability, it ensures that engineering knowledge remains coherent, authoritative, and sustainable throughout the evolution of the platform.
