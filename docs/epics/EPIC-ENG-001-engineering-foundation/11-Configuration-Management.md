# 11 Configuration Management

## Context

Configuration defines how software components, environments, tools, and workflows operate.

As FamilyOS evolves into a modular engineering ecosystem, configuration becomes a critical part of system reliability.

Poor configuration management can create:

* inconsistent environments;
* deployment failures;
* hidden dependencies;
* difficult troubleshooting;
* security risks.

Configuration Management establishes the principles required to create, maintain, validate, and evolve configurations throughout the FamilyOS lifecycle.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of Configuration Management is to ensure that configurations are:

* explicit;
* controlled;
* reproducible;
* traceable;
* maintainable.

Configuration must be treated as an engineering asset rather than an invisible implementation detail.

---

## Configuration Management Principles

### Principle 1 — Configuration Is an Engineering Artifact

Important configuration must be:

* documented;
* version controlled;
* reviewed;
* maintained.

Configuration changes represent engineering changes.

---

### Principle 2 — Explicit Configuration

Important behavior should be controlled through explicit configuration.

Avoid:

* hidden defaults;
* undocumented assumptions;
* environment-specific surprises.

Explicit configuration improves understanding and reliability.

---

### Principle 3 — Separation of Configuration and Code

Configuration and implementation should have clear responsibilities.

Code defines:

* behavior;
* logic;
* capabilities.

Configuration defines:

* settings;
* parameters;
* environment-specific values.

This separation improves flexibility and maintainability.

---

### Principle 4 — Reproducible Configuration

A contributor should be able to understand and recreate the required configuration state.

Configuration should support:

* consistent environments;
* predictable validation;
* reliable automation.

Reference:

* Environment Management

---

### Principle 5 — Secure Configuration Handling

Configuration management must consider security.

Sensitive information must not be handled as ordinary configuration.

Examples:

* credentials;
* secrets;
* private keys;
* protected tokens.

Secure configuration practices must be applied.

---

## Configuration Categories

FamilyOS configurations may include:

```text
Configuration

├── Application Configuration
│
├── Environment Configuration
│
├── Tool Configuration
│
├── Build Configuration
│
├── Test Configuration
│
├── Plugin Configuration
│
└── Release Configuration
```

Each category has its own engineering responsibilities and validation requirements.

---

## Application Configuration

Application configuration defines runtime behavior.

It should remain:

* understandable;
* validated;
* compatible with application architecture.

---

## Environment Configuration

Environment configuration defines execution contexts.

It supports:

* development;
* testing;
* automation;
* release environments.

Reference:

* 09-Environment-Management.md

---

## Tool Configuration

Tool configuration defines engineering tool behavior.

Examples:

* formatters;
* linters;
* static analysis;
* validation tools.

Tool configuration should remain consistent across contributors.

---

## Build Configuration

Build configuration defines how software is constructed.

It should support:

* reproducibility;
* automation;
* reliable artifacts.

Reference:

* EPIC-BLD-001 — Build Framework

---

## Test Configuration

Test configuration defines validation behavior.

It should ensure:

* predictable execution;
* consistent environments;
* reliable results.

Reference:

* EPIC-TST-001 — Testing Framework

---

## Plugin Configuration

Plugin configuration defines plugin behavior and integration.

It should respect:

* plugin architecture;
* capability boundaries;
* versioning rules.

---

## Release Configuration

Release configuration supports controlled delivery.

It should provide:

* traceability;
* reproducibility;
* release consistency.

Reference:

* EPIC-REL-001 — Release Framework

---

## Configuration Validation

Configuration should be validated whenever possible.

Validation may include:

* syntax checking;
* schema validation;
* compatibility verification;
* automated checks.

---

## Configuration Lifecycle

Configuration is managed throughout its lifecycle.

```

Lifecycle management ensures configuration remains consistent, traceable, secure, and maintainable throughout the lifetime of the platform.

---

## Configuration Versioning

Configuration changes should be traceable.

Version control provides:

* history;
* review capability;
* rollback possibilities.

---

## Configuration Changes

Configuration changes should follow the engineering workflow.

Depending on impact, changes may require:

* code review;
* testing;
* documentation updates;
* ADR;
* RFC.

---

## Configuration and Dependencies

Configuration often defines dependency behavior.

It should remain aligned with:

* dependency versions;
* environment requirements;
* build processes.

Reference:

* Dependency Management

---

## Configuration and Automation

Automation relies on predictable configuration.

Well-managed configuration enables:

* CI/CD reliability;
* automated validation;
* repeatable processes.

---

## Configuration Documentation

Important configurations should explain:

* purpose;
* ownership;
* expected usage;
* constraints.

Documentation prevents knowledge loss.

Reference:

* EPIC-DOC-001 — Documentation Framework

---

## Governance

Configuration changes should follow engineering governance.

Significant configuration decisions should remain:

* reviewed;
* documented;
* traceable.

Major configuration changes affecting engineering workflows or architecture should be evaluated through the appropriate governance process and documented using ADRs or RFCs when required.

---

## Success Criteria

Configuration Management is successful when:

* configuration remains understandable;
* environments are reproducible;
* changes are traceable;
* automation remains reliable;
* security risks are controlled.

---

## Final Statement

Configuration Management provides the engineering discipline required to control the operational behavior of FamilyOS systems.

By managing configuration throughout its complete lifecycle, FamilyOS ensures reproducibility, operational consistency, engineering transparency, and sustainable long-term platform evolution.
