# 22 Release

## Context

The Engineering Foundation establishes the engineering operating model required for the sustainable evolution of FamilyOS.

A release of EPIC-ENG-001 represents the formal publication of an Engineering Foundation state that has already completed its documentation, engineering, repository, and quality validation lifecycle.

The Engineering Foundation is currently:

```text
COMPLETED
VALIDATED
APPROVED
READY FOR PUBLICATION
```

The release process defined in this document governs the transition from an approved repository state to an officially published FamilyOS repository release.

Publication remains separate from EPIC implementation completion.

---

## Release Objectives

The objective of the Engineering Foundation release is to establish:

* an official FamilyOS engineering foundation;
* shared engineering principles;
* standardized engineering practices;
* explicit engineering governance;
* reproducible engineering expectations;
* traceable validation evidence;
* integration boundaries for specialized engineering frameworks;
* a stable baseline for future FamilyOS engineering evolution.

The release provides a controlled engineering baseline upon which specialized FamilyOS frameworks can build.

---

## Release Principles

### Stability

A released Engineering Foundation MUST represent an approved and reliable engineering baseline.

Unvalidated or partially validated states MUST NOT be published as official releases.

---

### Traceability

Every release MUST remain connected to:

* documentation state;
* validation evidence;
* repository history;
* version information;
* approval information;
* release commit;
* publication tag.

---

### Reproducibility

The released state MUST be identifiable, reproducible, and recoverable from repository history.

The repository commit and publication tag MUST identify the exact approved Engineering Foundation state.

---

### Validation Before Release

Validation MUST precede publication.

An official release MUST NOT be published while required documentation, engineering, repository, or quality validation remains unresolved.

---

### Controlled Evolution

The Engineering Foundation establishes a stable baseline that evolves through governed and traceable improvements.

Future revisions MUST preserve the engineering governance and validation principles established by EPIC-ENG-001.

---

## Release Lifecycle

Every Engineering Foundation release follows a controlled lifecycle.

## Release Approval

Release approval confirms that EPIC-ENG-001 satisfies its engineering objectives and required quality gates.

Approval responsibilities include:

| Role                 | Responsibility            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Engineering Owners   | Engineering approval      |
| Architects           | Architectural consistency |
| Documentation Owners | Documentation approval    |
| Quality Owners       | Quality-gate verification |

Final approval state:

```text
APPROVED
```

---

## Release Decision

The current release decision is:

```text
APPROVED — READY FOR PUBLICATION
```

The Engineering Foundation has satisfied:

* documentation requirements;
* engineering review requirements;
* quality-gate requirements;
* repository validation requirements;
* release-readiness requirements;
* final approval requirements.

The EPIC is therefore complete.

Publication remains the final repository operation.

---

## Blocked Release Rule

Future Engineering Foundation releases MUST remain blocked when:

* a required quality gate fails;
* documentation remains incomplete;
* validation evidence is missing;
* repository state is unsuitable for release;
* engineering review identifies unresolved blocking issues;
* final approval has not been recorded.

A blocked future release remains in its pre-completion lifecycle state until the blocking condition is resolved.

This rule describes future release governance and does not describe the current completed EPIC-ENG-001 state.

---

## Versioning Model

EPIC-ENG-001 uses two related but distinct version identities.

### EPIC Document Version

```text
1.0.0
```

This identifies the Engineering Foundation document contract.

---

### Repository Publication Version

Repository release tags follow the FamilyOS repository-wide release sequence.

Recent framework publication tags include:

```text
v4.6.0-quality-framework
v4.7.0-build-framework
v4.8.0-release-framework
v4.9.0-observability-framework
v5.0.0-security-framework
v5.1.0-operations-framework
```

The target Engineering Foundation publication tag is:

```text
v5.2.0-engineering-foundation
```

---

## Historical Engineering Tags

Historical Engineering Foundation and Engineering Platform tags include:

```text
v4.0.0-engineering-foundation
v4.1.0-engineering-platform-foundation
v4.1.1-engineering-platform-foundation
v4.3.0-engineering-platform-foundation-complete
```

These tags represent immutable historical repository states.

They MUST NOT be rewritten, moved, or repurposed.

The current normalized Engineering Foundation baseline is published separately through the current repository release sequence.

---

## Target Publication Tag

Target:

```text
v5.2.0-engineering-foundation
```

The tag was verified as available during final validation.

The tag MUST be created only after the final closure commit exists.

---

## Git Integration

The final approved Engineering Foundation publication is represented through Git.

After final staged verification and closure commit creation, the intended tagging workflow is:

```bash
git tag -a v5.2.0-engineering-foundation \
  -m "EPIC-ENG-001 Engineering Foundation completed"

git push origin feature/foundation-engineering-docs
git push origin v5.2.0-engineering-foundation
```

These commands MUST NOT be executed until:

1. all closure files are staged;
2. the staged diff has been reviewed;
3. the final closure commit exists;
4. the target tag remains available.

---

## Publication Sequence

The final publication sequence is:

```text
Stage closure files
        │
        ▼
Validate staged diff
        │
        ▼

```

---

## Post-Release Maintenance

Following successful publication:

* engineering practices remain maintained;
* improvements follow governance rules;
* documentation remains synchronized;
* compatibility considerations are preserved;
* future revisions remain traceable;
* validation evidence remains historically available;
* official release tags remain immutable.

---

## Future Evolution

Future Engineering Foundation releases may introduce:

* advanced engineering automation;
* engineering analytics;
* improved developer experience;
* stronger framework integration;
* additional governance automation;
* intelligent engineering assistance.

Such evolution MUST remain compatible with the principles and governance model established by the Engineering Foundation.

---

## Integration With Specialized EPICs

The Engineering Foundation provides the baseline for specialized FamilyOS engineering frameworks, including:

* EPIC-DOC-001 — Documentation Foundation;
* EPIC-TST-001 — Testing Framework;
* EPIC-QLT-001 — Quality Framework;
* EPIC-BLD-001 — Build Framework;
* EPIC-REL-001 — Release Framework;
* EPIC-OBS-001 — Observability Framework;
* EPIC-SEC-001 — Security Framework;
* EPIC-OPS-001 — Operations Framework.

Detailed testing architecture and governance belong to EPIC-TST-001.

Detailed quality architecture, evidence, metrics, gates, and governance belong to EPIC-QLT-001.

Detailed build architecture, execution, artifacts, and automation belong to EPIC-BLD-001.

Detailed release lifecycle, publication, rollback, compliance, and release governance belong to EPIC-REL-001.

EPIC-ENG-001 establishes the common engineering baseline without replacing these specialized frameworks.

---

## Release Governance

Engineering Foundation releases follow Technical Governance.

Every official release MUST remain:

* documented;
* reviewed;
* validated;
* approved;
* traceable;
* reproducible.

Major engineering changes SHOULD follow the established governance process before inclusion in future Engineering Foundation releases.
