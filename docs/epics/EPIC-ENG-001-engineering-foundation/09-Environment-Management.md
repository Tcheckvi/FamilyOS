# 09 Environment Management

## Context

Software development requires reliable and consistent environments throughout the engineering lifecycle.

As FamilyOS grows with multiple contributors, plugins, domains, and automation systems, differences between environments can introduce unnecessary complexity and unpredictable behavior.

Environment Management establishes the principles required to create, maintain, and evolve consistent engineering environments.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of Environment Management is to ensure that FamilyOS engineering activities can be be performed in environments that are:

* reproducible;
* isolated;
* documented;
* predictable;
* maintainable.

A reliable environment is a foundation for reliable software.

---

## Environment Management Principles

### Principle 1 — Reproducible Environments

Engineering environments should produce consistent results regardless of where they are executed.

Environment definition should include:

* required tools;
* dependencies;
* configuration;
* validation requirements.

A contributor should be able to recreate an environment from documented sources.

---

### Principle 2 — Environment as Code

Environment configuration should be treated as an engineering artifact.

Important environment definitions should be:

* version controlled;
* reviewed;
* documented;
* reproducible.

Undocumented environment assumptions create long-term risks.

---

### Principle 3 — Separation of Environments

Different lifecycle stages require different environments.

FamilyOS recognizes environments such as:

```text
Development
      │
      ▼
Validation
      │
      ▼
Continuous Integration
      │
      ▼
Release
```

Each environment has a specific purpose.

---

### Principle 4 — Controlled Dependencies

Environment dependencies should be explicit.

This includes:

* runtime versions;
* libraries;
* tools;
* external requirements.

Hidden dependencies reduce reliability.

---

### Principle 5 — Consistent Developer Experience

Contributors should experience similar workflows across environments.

Consistency improves:

* onboarding;
* collaboration;
* troubleshooting;
* productivity.

---

## Environment Categories

### Development Environment

The development environment supports daily engineering activities.

It should provide:

* source code access;
* development tools;
* local validation;
* debugging capabilities.

---

### Testing Environment

The testing environment supports software validation.

It should provide:

* repeatable test execution;
* controlled dependencies;
* reliable validation results.

Reference:

* EPIC-TST-001 — Testing Framework

---

### CI/CD Environment

The CI/CD environment provides automated engineering validation.

It should support:

* automated checks;
* reproducible execution;
* quality gates;
* reporting.

Reference:

* EPIC-BLD-001 — Build Framework
* EPIC-REL-001 — Release Framework

---

### Release Environment

The release environment supports controlled delivery.

It should ensure:

* validated artifacts;
* reproducible builds;
* traceable versions.

---

## Environment Configuration

Environment configuration should define:

* runtime requirements;
* dependency versions;
* tool configuration;
* execution requirements.

Configuration changes should be reviewed when they impact engineering workflows.

---

## Environment Isolation

Isolation helps prevent:

* dependency conflicts;
* accidental configuration sharing;
* inconsistent validation.

Isolation may apply to:

* local development;
* testing;
* automation;
* release processes.

---

## Environment Lifecycle

Engineering environments have a managed lifecycle.

Each environment should progress through the following stages:

```text
Definition
      │
      ▼
Provisioning
      │
      ▼
Validation
      │
      ▼
Operational Use
      │
      ▼
Maintenance
      │
      ▼
Retirement
```

Environment lifecycle management ensures long-term consistency, traceability, and reproducibility.

---

## Dependency Management Relationship

Environment management depends on controlled dependency management.

Dependencies should be:

* explicitly declared;
* version controlled;
* regularly reviewed.

Reference:

* Dependency Management Framework

---

## Environment Validation

Environments should be validated before use.

Validation may include:

* required tools available;
* dependencies correctly installed;
* configuration consistency;
* automated checks passing.

---

## Environment Documentation

Environment knowledge must remain documented.

Documentation should cover:

* purpose;
* requirements;
* configuration;
* maintenance expectations.

Reference:

* EPIC-DOC-001 — Documentation Framework

---

## Environment Evolution

Environment changes are part of engineering evolution.

Changes should consider:

* contributor impact;
* compatibility;
* automation impact;
* migration effort.

Significant changes may require:

* ADR;
* RFC;
* migration documentation.

---

## Relationship With Engineering Domains

### Development Workflow

Provides the environments where engineering activities happen.

---

### Toolchain

Defines the tools used inside environments.

---

### Build Framework

Ensures consistent construction environments.

---

### Testing Framework

Ensures reliable validation environments.

---

### Release Framework

Ensures controlled delivery environments.

---

## Governance

Environment management follows engineering governance rules.

Environment decisions should remain:

* explicit;
* documented;
* traceable.

Changes affecting engineering environments should be reviewed through the appropriate governance process and documented using ADRs or RFCs when they introduce architectural or operational impacts.

---

## Success Criteria

Environment Management is successful when:

* contributors can create reliable environments;
* validation results are reproducible;
* dependencies remain controlled;
* environment differences are minimized;
* engineering workflows remain predictable.

---

## Final Statement

Environment Management provides the foundation required for consistent FamilyOS engineering operations.

By treating environments as managed engineering assets throughout their lifecycle, FamilyOS ensures reliable development, reproducible validation, and sustainable long-term platform evolution.
