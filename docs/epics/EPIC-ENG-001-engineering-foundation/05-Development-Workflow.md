# 05 Development Workflow

## Context

The FamilyOS development workflow defines how engineering changes are planned, designed, implemented, validated, reviewed, and integrated.

As FamilyOS grows through multiple domains, plugins, and engineering frameworks, development activities must follow a predictable and transparent process.

A consistent workflow reduces uncertainty, improves collaboration, and protects long-term software quality.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of the Development Workflow is to establish a common engineering process for:

* introducing changes,
* implementing features,
* fixing problems,
* reviewing solutions,
* integrating improvements.

The workflow ensures that engineering activities remain aligned with FamilyOS principles.

---

## Development Workflow Principles

### Principle 1 — Understand Before Changing

Changes should begin with understanding the existing system.

Before implementation, contributors should identify:

* the affected domain,
* existing architecture,
* related documentation,
* potential impacts.

Understanding reduces unnecessary changes.

---

### Principle 2 — Design Before Implementation

Significant changes should be designed before code is written.

Design activities may include:

* architecture analysis,
* technical discussion,
* RFC creation,
* ADR creation,
* specification updates.

---

### Principle 3 — Small and Controlled Changes

Changes should remain focused and understandable.

Benefits:

* easier reviews,
* reduced risk,
* clearer history,
* simpler rollback.

---

### Principle 4 — Continuous Validation

Validation should happen throughout development.

Validation includes:

* automated checks,
* testing,
* static analysis,
* documentation verification.

---

## Development Lifecycle

FamilyOS development follows this lifecycle:

```

---

## Phase 1 — Idea and Analysis

### Objective

Understand the purpose and impact of a change.

Activities:

* identify the problem;
* define the expected outcome;
* evaluate affected areas;
* locate existing documentation.

Possible artifacts:

* issue;
* proposal;
* RFC.

---

## Phase 2 — Design

### Objective

Define the solution before implementation.

Activities:

* evaluate architecture impact;
* define responsibilities;
* identify dependencies;
* document decisions.

Possible artifacts:

* ADR;
* specification;
* technical design.

---

## Phase 3 — Implementation

### Objective

Create the required changes.

Implementation should follow:

* architecture principles;
* coding standards;
* repository organization;
* domain boundaries.

---

## Phase 4 — Validation

### Objective

Verify that the change meets expectations.

Validation may include:

* unit tests;
* integration tests;
* static analysis;
* formatting checks;
* documentation validation.

---

## Quality Gate

### Objective

Ensure that every change satisfies the minimum engineering quality requirements before formal review.

Typical quality gates include:

* successful automated validation;
* passing test suite;
* static analysis completed;
* documentation updated when required;
* no unresolved critical issues.

Only changes that satisfy these minimum engineering quality requirements should proceed to formal engineering review.

---

## Phase 5 — Review

### Objective

Ensure quality and alignment.

Reviews should evaluate:

* correctness;
* maintainability;
* architecture consistency;
* documentation impact;
* testing coverage.

---

## Phase 6 — Integration

### Objective

Safely integrate approved changes.

Integration requires:

* successful validation;
* completed review;
* traceable history.

---

## Development Change Categories

FamilyOS recognizes several change types.

### Feature Development

Introduces new capabilities.

---

### Bug Fix

Corrects unexpected behavior.

---

### Refactoring

Improves internal structure without changing expected behavior.

---

### Architectural Change

Changes system structure or boundaries.

May require:

* ADR;
* RFC;
* additional review.

---

### Documentation Change

Updates engineering knowledge and references.

Reference:

* EPIC-DOC-001 — Documentation Framework

---

## Engineering Feedback Loop

Development follows a continuous improvement loop:

```text
Develop
    │
    ▼
Validate
    │
    ▼
Review
    │
    ▼
Learn
    │
    ▼
Improve
```

---

## Relationship With Quality

Development workflow integrates quality from the beginning.

Quality activities are not isolated after implementation.

They are part of:

* design;
* development;
* validation;
* review.

Reference:

* Quality Framework

---

## Relationship With Testing

Testing supports every development phase.

Tests provide confidence that:

* behavior is preserved;
* regressions are detected;
* changes remain reliable.

Reference:

* Testing Framework

---

## Relationship With Documentation

Engineering knowledge must evolve with implementation.

When changes affect understanding of the system:

* documentation must be updated;
* decisions must remain traceable;
* references must stay valid.

Reference:

* Documentation Framework

---

## Development Workflow Governance

Workflow improvements should be managed through:

* engineering discussions;
* RFCs;
* framework updates.

The workflow itself evolves as FamilyOS matures.

---

## Success Criteria

The Development Workflow is successful when:

* contributors follow a predictable process;
* changes are easier to understand;
* reviews become more effective;
* validation happens consistently;
* engineering knowledge remains synchronized.

---

## Final Statement

The FamilyOS Development Workflow transforms software development from an individual activity into a structured engineering process.

It provides the repeatable path required to build, validate, and evolve a sustainable engineering ecosystem.
