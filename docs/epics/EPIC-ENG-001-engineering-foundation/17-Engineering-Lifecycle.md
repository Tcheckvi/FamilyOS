# 17 Engineering Lifecycle

## Context

Software evolution is a continuous process.

As FamilyOS grows through multiple domains, plugins, frameworks, and engineering capabilities, changes must follow a predictable lifecycle.

The Engineering Lifecycle defines how ideas become implemented, validated, integrated, and maintained engineering outcomes.

A controlled lifecycle allows FamilyOS to evolve while preserving:

* quality;
* traceability;
* maintainability;
* architectural coherence.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of the Engineering Lifecycle is to define the global engineering process that connects every engineering discipline within FamilyOS.

Rather than replacing specialized engineering lifecycles, it coordinates them into one coherent engineering model.

The Engineering Lifecycle provides a common framework for:

* understanding needs;
* designing solutions;
* implementing changes;
* validating results;
* governing engineering evolution.

---

## Engineering Lifecycle Principles

### Principle 1 — Every Change Has a Lifecycle

Engineering changes should not appear directly as isolated implementations.

Each significant change should move through identifiable stages.

A lifecycle provides:

* visibility;
* control;
* consistency.

---

### Principle 2 — Appropriate Process for Appropriate Change

Not every change requires the same level of process.

The lifecycle should adapt according to:

* complexity;
* impact;
* architectural importance;
* risk.

Small changes may require lightweight validation.

Major changes may require:

* RFC;
* ADR;
* specification;
* additional review.

---

### Principle 3 — Knowledge Evolves With Software

Engineering knowledge must evolve together with implementation.

A completed engineering change should leave:

* understandable code;
* updated documentation;
* preserved decisions;
* validated behavior.

---

### Principle 4 — Validation Is Continuous

Validation is not only a final phase.

Confidence should be built throughout the lifecycle through:

* design review;
* automated checks;
* testing;
* quality validation.

## Global Engineering Lifecycle

FamilyOS follows the following engineering lifecycle.

```

This lifecycle defines the global engineering flow of the platform.

## Engineering Lifecycle Integration

The global Engineering Lifecycle coordinates the specialized engineering lifecycles defined throughout the Engineering Foundation.

```text
Engineering Lifecycle

        │
        ├── Development Workflow
        ├── Toolchain Lifecycle
        ├── Environment Lifecycle
        ├── Dependency Lifecycle
        ├── Configuration Lifecycle
        ├── Build Lifecycle
        ├── Testing Lifecycle
        ├── Documentation Lifecycle
        └── Quality Lifecycle
```

Each specialized lifecycle focuses on one engineering capability.

The Engineering Lifecycle provides the common coordination model that keeps them aligned.

---

## Phase 1 — Need Identification

### Objective

Understand why a change is required.

Activities include:

* identifying the problem;
* defining the expected outcome;
* evaluating affected areas.

Possible inputs:

* user needs;
* defects;
* technical improvements;
* platform evolution.

---

## Phase 2 — Analysis

### Objective

Understand the impact of the proposed change.

Analysis should consider:

* architecture;
* domains;
* dependencies;
* quality;
* documentation.

Possible artifacts:

* Issue;
* Proposal;
* RFC.

---

## Phase 3 — Design

### Objective

Define the solution before implementation.

Design may include:

* architectural evaluation;
* responsibilities;
* interfaces;
* engineering constraints.

Possible artifacts:

* ADR;
* Specification;
* Technical Documentation.

---

## Phase 4 — Implementation

### Objective

Transform the approved design into working software.

Implementation follows:

* Coding Standards;
* Repository Architecture;
* Development Workflow.

---

## Phase 5 — Validation

### Objective

Verify engineering expectations.

Validation may include:

* testing;
* static analysis;
* documentation verification;
* build validation;
* quality gates.

---

## Phase 6 — Integration

### Objective

Safely integrate validated changes.

Integration requires:

* successful validation;
* completed review;
* traceable engineering history.

---

## Phase 7 — Release

### Objective

Deliver validated engineering artifacts.

Release activities may include:

* versioning;
* artifact publication;
* release documentation;
* compatibility information.

---

## Phase 8 — Maintenance

### Objective

Preserve engineering quality after delivery.

Maintenance includes:

* bug fixes;
* dependency updates;
* documentation maintenance;
* technical debt reduction.

---

## Phase 9 — Continuous Evolution

### Objective

Continuously improve FamilyOS.

Evolution may include:

* architectural improvements;
* engineering process refinement;
* tooling improvements;
* quality improvements.

Engineering never reaches a final state.

---

## Relationship With Other Engineering Frameworks

The Engineering Lifecycle orchestrates:

* Development Workflow;
* Toolchain;
* Environment Management;
* Dependency Management;
* Configuration Management;
* Build Philosophy;
* Testing Philosophy;
* Documentation Philosophy;
* Quality Philosophy;
* Technical Governance.

It provides the engineering context in which each framework operates.

---

## Governance

The Engineering Lifecycle is governed by the Technical Governance framework.

Changes affecting the lifecycle should be evaluated for their impact on every specialized engineering lifecycle before approval.

---

## Success Criteria

The Engineering Lifecycle is successful when:

* engineering changes follow a predictable process;
* specialized lifecycles remain coordinated;
* engineering knowledge remains synchronized;
* governance remains effective;
* FamilyOS evolves sustainably.

---

## Final Statement

The Engineering Lifecycle is the central coordination model of the FamilyOS Engineering Foundation.

By orchestrating every specialized engineering lifecycle into a single coherent process, it enables FamilyOS to evolve consistently while preserving architectural integrity, engineering quality, and long-term sustainability.
