# 14 Documentation Philosophy

## Context

Documentation is a fundamental engineering capability within the FamilyOS ecosystem.

As the platform grows through multiple domains, plugins, specifications, and engineering frameworks, knowledge must remain accessible and understandable over time.

Software without maintained knowledge becomes difficult to evolve.

Documentation ensures that engineering decisions, architectural concepts, and operational practices remain available to current and future contributors.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of Documentation Philosophy within the Engineering Foundation is to define the strategic role of documentation.

Documentation exists to preserve:

* engineering knowledge;
* architectural decisions;
* technical reasoning;
* operational practices;
* ecosystem understanding.

Documentation is considered an engineering asset.

---

## Documentation Philosophy Principles

### Principle 1 — Documentation Is Part of Engineering

Documentation is not an optional activity performed after implementation.

It is integrated into engineering processes.

Important changes should consider:

* documentation impact;
* knowledge preservation;
* future understanding.

---

### Principle 2 — Knowledge Must Be Preserved

FamilyOS is designed for long-term evolution.

Important engineering knowledge must survive:

* contributor changes;
* architectural evolution;
* platform growth.

Documentation prevents knowledge from existing only in individual memory.

---

### Principle 3 — Decisions Must Be Traceable

Important engineering decisions should remain connected to their context.

Traceability may involve:

* ADRs;
* RFCs;
* specifications;
* EPIC documentation;
* engineering records.

A decision without context becomes difficult to maintain.

---

### Principle 4 — Documentation Should Explain Intent

Documentation should not only describe what exists.

It should explain:

* why something exists;
* what problem it solves;
* what constraints influenced the design.

Intent is essential for long-term maintenance.

---

### Principle 5 — Documentation Evolves With the System

Documentation must evolve together with software.

Changes affecting:

* architecture;
* workflows;
* standards;
* behavior;

should trigger documentation review.

Outdated documentation creates engineering risk.

---

### Principle 6 — Documentation Must Be Discoverable

Useful knowledge must be easy to find.

Documentation organization should support:

* navigation;
* references;
* relationships between artifacts;
* contributor onboarding.

---

## Documentation as a System Component

FamilyOS documentation forms a structured knowledge system.

```text
Engineering Knowledge

├── Foundation Documents
├── Architecture Decisions
├── Specifications
├── Engineering Frameworks
├── Plugin Documentation
├── Guides
└── References
```

Every documentation category contributes to the long-term engineering knowledge of the platform.

---

## Documentation and Architecture

Architecture requires explicit knowledge management.

Documentation supports:

* architectural understanding;
* decision history;
* system boundaries;
* evolution planning.

Reference:

* Architecture Framework
* ADR Process

---

## Documentation and Development Workflow

Documentation is integrated into development activities.

Changes may require updates to:

* specifications;
* guides;
* architecture records;
* engineering documentation.

A completed engineering change should leave the platform better understood than before.

---

## Documentation and Quality

Documentation contributes to engineering quality.

Good documentation improves:

* maintainability;
* collaboration;
* reliability;
* onboarding.

Quality is affected when knowledge is missing or outdated.

Reference:

* Quality Framework

---

## Documentation and Testing

Testing knowledge should remain documented.

Documentation may explain:

* testing strategies;
* validation expectations;
* important scenarios.

Reference:

* Testing Framework

---

## Documentation and Release

Releases should preserve knowledge about changes.

Documentation may include:

* release information;
* migration guidance;
* compatibility information.

Reference:

* Release Framework

---

## Documentation Lifecycle

Documentation follows a controlled lifecycle.

---

## Documentation Provenance

Every authoritative engineering document should preserve sufficient provenance information.

Typical provenance includes:

* document identifier;
* version;
* approval status;
* revision history;
* owning authority;
* related engineering artifacts.

Documentation provenance strengthens traceability, governance, maintenance, and engineering confidence.

---

## Documentation Automation

Where practical, documentation processes should be supported by automation.

Examples:

* validation;
* reference checking;
* metadata verification;
* generation support.

Automation improves consistency.

---

## Documentation Governance

Documentation requires ownership and maintenance.

Responsibilities include:

* creating accurate information;
* reviewing changes;
* maintaining references;
* removing obsolete content.

Significant documentation changes should follow the documented engineering governance process.

---

## Documentation Evolution

The documentation ecosystem evolves with FamilyOS.

Improvements may include:

* better navigation;
* automation;
* improved search;
* stronger relationships between artifacts.

Changes follow documentation governance rules.

---

## Success Criteria

Documentation Philosophy is successful when:

* engineering knowledge remains accessible;
* decisions remain traceable;
* contributors can understand the system;
* documentation evolves with implementation;
* knowledge is preserved over time.

---

## Final Statement

Documentation Philosophy establishes knowledge management as a core engineering capability of FamilyOS.

By managing documentation throughout its lifecycle and preserving its provenance, FamilyOS ensures that engineering knowledge remains reliable, traceable, and sustainable throughout the lifetime of the platform.
