# 16 Technical Governance

## Context

Technical decisions shape the evolution of the FamilyOS ecosystem.

As FamilyOS grows through multiple domains, plugins, frameworks, and engineering capabilities, decisions must remain aligned, understandable, and traceable.

Technical Governance establishes the principles and processes that ensure engineering decisions are made responsibly and preserved over time.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of Technical Governance within the Engineering Foundation is to define how technical decisions are:

* created;
* evaluated;
* documented;
* reviewed;
* evolved.

Governance ensures that technical evolution remains intentional rather than accidental.

---

## Technical Governance Principles

### Principle 1 — Explicit Decisions

Important technical decisions must be visible.

Decisions should not exist only through:

* personal knowledge;
* undocumented discussions;
* temporary implementations.

Important decisions must be captured through appropriate engineering artifacts.

---

### Principle 2 — Appropriate Decision Artifacts

FamilyOS uses different artifacts for different decision levels.

```text
Decision

├── ADR
│   └── Architecture Decision

├── RFC
│   └── Technical Proposal

├── SPEC
│   └── Formal Requirement

├── EPIC
│   └── Large Engineering Initiative

└── Documentation
    └── Knowledge Preservation
```

Each artifact has a defined purpose.

---

### Principle 3 — Traceability

Technical decisions must remain connected to their context.

Traceability should allow contributors to understand:

* why a decision was made;
* what alternatives were considered;
* what impact exists;
* how the decision evolved.

---

### Principle 4 — Review Before Impact

Decisions that significantly affect the platform should be reviewed before implementation.

Review helps evaluate:

* architectural impact;
* maintenance consequences;
* compatibility risks;
* engineering alignment.

---

### Principle 5 — Long-Term Thinking

Technical decisions should consider future evolution.

Evaluation should include:

* maintainability;
* scalability;
* security;
* operational impact;
* ecosystem growth.

---

## Governance Decision Levels

FamilyOS decisions exist at different levels.

```text
Strategic Decisions
        │
        ▼
Architectural Decisions
        │
        ▼
Engineering Decisions
        │
        ▼
Implementation Decisions
```

Each level requires an appropriate decision process.

---

## Strategic Decisions

Strategic decisions affect long-term platform direction.

Examples:

* major architecture evolution;
* engineering framework changes;
* platform-wide standards.

Possible artifacts:

* EPIC;
* RFC;
* ADR.

---

## Architectural Decisions

Architectural decisions affect system structure.

Examples:

* component boundaries;
* dependency direction;
* extension mechanisms.

Primary artifact:

* ADR.

---

## Engineering Decisions

Engineering decisions affect development practices.

Examples:

* workflow changes;
* tooling choices;
* validation improvements.

Possible artifacts:

* RFC;
* documentation updates.

---

## Implementation Decisions

Implementation decisions concern local solutions.

They should remain aligned with:

* architecture;
* standards;
* existing practices.

---

## Governance Workflow

Technical decisions follow a structured process.

```text
Identify Need
      │
      ▼
Analyze Impact
      │
      ▼
Select Artifact
      │
      ▼

Approve
      │
      ▼
Implement
      │
      ▼
Document
      │
      ▼
Maintain
```

Governance continues after implementation by preserving engineering knowledge and reviewing decisions over time.

---

## Governance Authority Model

Technical governance relies on clearly defined decision authority.

Responsibilities are distributed according to engineering scope.

| Authority | Primary Responsibility |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Contributors | Propose improvements and implement approved changes |
| Reviewers | Validate engineering quality and alignment |
| Maintainers | Preserve repository consistency and long-term maintainability |
| Architects | Approve architectural direction and system integrity |
| Engineering Governance | Resolve conflicts, approve strategic changes, and evolve engineering standards |

Clear authority improves consistency while avoiding unnecessary decision bottlenecks.

---

## Governance and Documentation

Governance depends on documentation.

Decisions should remain connected to:

* specifications;
* architecture documents;
* engineering frameworks;
* implementation references.

Reference:

* Documentation Framework

---

## Governance and Architecture

Architecture governance ensures that technical evolution remains coherent.

Architecture decisions should respect:

* domain boundaries;
* modularity;
* dependency rules;
* platform principles.

Reference:

* Architecture Principles

---

## Governance and Quality

Technical governance considers quality impact.

Decisions should evaluate:

* reliability;
* maintainability;
* testability;
* operational consequences.

Reference:

* Quality Philosophy

---

## Governance and Security

Technical decisions should consider security implications.

Evaluation may include:

* trust boundaries;
* dependency risks;
* data protection;
* operational safety.

---

## Governance Ownership

Governance responsibilities include:

### Contributors

Responsible for proposing clear and documented changes.

---

### Reviewers

Responsible for evaluating impact and alignment.

---

### Maintainers

Responsible for preserving consistency over time.

---

### Architects

Responsible for architectural coherence.

---

## Governance Evolution

The governance model evolves with FamilyOS maturity.

Improvements may include:

* better automation;
* improved decision workflows;
* stronger traceability;
* clearer ownership.

Changes to governance should themselves follow the documented governance process.

---

## Success Criteria

Technical Governance is successful when:

* important decisions are explicit;
* engineering changes remain traceable;
* architecture remains coherent;
* contributors understand decision processes;
* technical evolution is controlled.

---

## Final Statement

Technical Governance establishes the decision-making framework required for FamilyOS to evolve responsibly.

By combining explicit authority, structured decision processes, documented governance, and long-term traceability, FamilyOS preserves architectural coherence while enabling sustainable engineering evolution.
