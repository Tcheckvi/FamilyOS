# 07 Project Structure

## Context

The FamilyOS project structure defines how engineering assets are organized to support long-term platform evolution.

As FamilyOS grows with new domains, plugins, frameworks, and automation capabilities, the project structure must remain understandable and adaptable.

A well-designed project structure reflects engineering responsibilities and supports collaboration.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of Project Structure is to establish the organizational principles that guide the arrangement of FamilyOS components.

The project structure should enable:

* clear ownership;
* easy navigation;
* modular evolution;
* reliable automation;
* efficient collaboration.

---

## Project Structure Principles

### Principle 1 — Structure Reflects Responsibilities

Project organization should represent meaningful engineering responsibilities.

Each area should have a clear purpose.

Examples:

* application source code;
* tests;
* documentation;
* specifications;
* automation;
* configuration.

A contributor should understand the role of a component by its location.

---

### Principle 2 — Separation of Concerns

Different engineering concerns should remain separated.

The project structure must avoid mixing:

* implementation;
* validation;
* documentation;
* operational tooling.

Clear separation reduces complexity and accidental coupling.

---

### Principle 3 — Domain-Oriented Organization

FamilyOS is organized around domains and capabilities.

Project structure should support:

* domain boundaries;
* independent evolution;
* plugin organization;
* explicit ownership.

---

### Principle 4 — Discoverability

The structure should help contributors quickly locate required information.

A contributor should be able to discover:

* where code belongs;
* where tests are located;
* where documentation exists;
* where engineering rules are defined.

---

### Principle 5 — Evolution Without Disruption

The project structure must support growth without frequent large migrations.

New capabilities should integrate naturally.

Examples:

* new plugins;
* new engineering frameworks;
* new automation tools.

---

## Project Organization Model

The FamilyOS repository follows a layered engineering organization.

```text
FamilyOS Repository

├── src/
│   ├── familyos_cli/
│   └── ...
│
├── tests/
│
├── docs/
│   ├── 00-foundation/
│   ├── 04-reference/
│   ├── 06-specifications/
│   ├── epics/
│   ├── rfcs/
│   └── adrs/
│
├── tools/
│
├── scripts/
│
├── configuration/
│
└── README.md
```

The repository structure should reflect engineering responsibilities rather than implementation convenience.

---

## Application Structure

Application code represents the implemented platform capabilities.

It should contain:

* domain logic;
* application services;
* infrastructure components;
* plugin implementations.

The application structure follows:

* Clean Architecture principles;
* Domain-Driven Design concepts;
* modular design practices.

---

## Test Structure

Tests are organized according to validation responsibilities.

The structure should support:

* unit tests;
* integration tests;
* plugin tests;
* framework validation.

Testing organization should make validation easy to discover and maintain.

Reference:

* EPIC-TST-001 — Testing Framework

---

## Documentation Structure

Documentation is maintained as a first-class project component.

It contains:

* architecture documentation;
* specifications;
* engineering frameworks;
* RFCs;
* ADRs;
* guides.

Reference:

* EPIC-DOC-001 — Documentation Framework

---

## Engineering Structure

Engineering documentation defines:

* development practices;
* standards;
* workflows;
* governance.

The engineering structure connects technical implementation with documented processes.

---

## Plugin Structure

FamilyOS plugins follow the modular project organization.

A plugin should clearly separate:

* plugin metadata;
* implementation;
* capabilities;
* contributions;
* tests;
* documentation.

This supports independent evolution of platform extensions.

---

## Automation Structure

Automation components support engineering workflows.

Examples:

* validation scripts;
* development utilities;
* CI/CD helpers;
* documentation tools.

Automation should remain organized and reusable.

---

## Configuration Structure

Configuration files should be:

* explicit;
* documented;
* validated whenever practical.

Configuration should never hide important engineering behavior.

---

## Relationship With Architecture

Project structure implements architectural intent.

The organization should support:

* dependency direction;
* component boundaries;
* modularity;
* maintainability.

A repository structure that conflicts with architecture creates long-term complexity.

---

## Relationship With Development Workflow

Project structure supports the development lifecycle.

It allows contributors to:

* locate affected areas;
* implement changes consistently;
* validate modifications;
* maintain traceability.

---

## Relationship With Automation

A predictable project structure enables automation.

Automation can reliably:

* locate components;
* execute validations;
* generate reports;
* manage releases.

---

## Structural Invariants

The FamilyOS project structure shall preserve the following invariants:

* every engineering asset has a single authoritative location;
* project responsibilities remain clearly separated;
* directory structures remain predictable across the repository;
* documentation paths remain stable whenever practical;
* automation shall not depend on undocumented repository layouts;
* structural changes shall preserve backward compatibility whenever reasonably possible.

These invariants protect repository stability while allowing the project structure to evolve incrementally.

---

## Governance

Changes to project structure should consider:

* architectural impact;
* contributor impact;
* automation impact;
* documentation impact.

Major structural changes should be documented through the appropriate engineering governance process and, when necessary, supported by an ADR or RFC.

---

## Success Criteria

Project Structure is successful when:

* contributors understand repository organization;
* components have clear locations;
* domains remain separated;
* automation can operate reliably;
* future growth remains manageable.

---

## Final Statement

The FamilyOS Project Structure provides the organizational foundation required for scalable engineering.

By aligning repository organization with architecture, ownership, and engineering responsibilities, FamilyOS can continue to evolve while preserving clarity, consistency, and long-term maintainability.
