# 06 Coding Standards

## Context

Coding standards define the common expectations that guide software implementation across the FamilyOS ecosystem.

As FamilyOS grows through multiple domains, plugins, and engineering teams, consistent coding practices are required to maintain:

* readability;
* reliability;
* maintainability;
* collaboration efficiency.

Coding standards transform individual coding preferences into shared engineering practices.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of Coding Standards within the Engineering Foundation is to establish the role and objectives of code consistency.

Coding standards ensure that software created within FamilyOS remains:

* understandable;
* predictable;
* maintainable;
* aligned with architectural principles.

---

## Coding Standards Principles

### Principle 1 — Code Is a Long-Term Asset

Code is not only written for immediate execution.

It is maintained, extended, reviewed, and understood by future contributors.

Therefore, code should prioritize:

* clarity;
* simplicity;
* explicit behavior;
* maintainability.

---

### Principle 2 — Consistency Reduces Complexity

Consistent code organization reduces the cognitive effort required to understand the platform.

Consistency applies to:

* naming;
* structure;
* patterns;
* error handling;
* documentation;
* testing practices.

---

### Principle 3 — Readability Over Cleverness

Code should favor understandable solutions over unnecessarily complex optimizations.

A simple and clear implementation is generally preferred over a shorter but harder-to-maintain solution.

---

### Principle 4 — Explicit Behavior

FamilyOS code should make important behavior visible.

Avoid:

* hidden side effects;
* unclear responsibilities;
* implicit dependencies.

Explicit code improves:

* debugging;
* reviews;
* maintenance.

---

### Principle 5 — Strong Typing and Validation

Code should use strong typing and validation practices whenever possible.

Benefits include:

* earlier error detection;
* improved tooling;
* safer refactoring;
* clearer contracts.

---

### Principle 6 — Automation Supports Consistency

Engineering standards should be enforced by automation whenever practical.

Automation should verify:

* formatting;
* linting;
* type checking;
* static analysis;
* documentation quality.

Automation reduces subjective interpretation and improves engineering consistency.

---

## Coding Standards Scope

Coding standards apply across:

* core platform code;
* official plugins;
* engineering tools;
* automation components;
* supporting libraries.

---

## Coding Quality Expectations

### Maintainability

Code should remain easy to:

* understand;
* modify;
* extend;
* validate.

---

### Testability

Code should support reliable verification.

Design choices should enable:

* isolated testing;
* predictable behavior;
* automated validation.

---

### Modularity

Code should respect boundaries between components.

Modules should:

* have clear responsibilities;
* minimize unnecessary coupling;
* expose stable interfaces.

---

### Documentation

Code should be supported by appropriate documentation when behavior or decisions require explanation.

Documentation should explain:

* why something exists;
* important constraints;
* architectural intent.

---

## Coding Standards and Architecture

Coding practices must support FamilyOS architecture principles.

They should reinforce:

* separation of concerns;
* dependency control;
* domain boundaries;
* plugin isolation;
* stable contracts.

Code organization must reflect architectural decisions.

---

## Coding Standards and Review

Coding standards provide a common basis for reviews.

Reviews should evaluate:

* correctness;
* clarity;
* consistency;
* maintainability;
* alignment with architecture.

Standards help reviewers focus on engineering value instead of personal preferences.

---

## Coding Standards and Automation

Where practical, coding standards should be supported by automation.

Examples:

* formatting tools;
* static analysis;
* type checking;
* linting;
* automated validation.

Automation provides consistent enforcement.

---

## Code Ownership

Engineering quality depends on clear ownership.

Every significant area of the codebase should have identified maintainers responsible for:

* reviewing changes;
* preserving architectural consistency;
* approving significant modifications;
* coordinating refactoring efforts;
* ensuring documentation remains synchronized with implementation.

Code ownership improves accountability while supporting long-term maintainability and knowledge sharing.

Ownership should encourage collaboration rather than creating isolated knowledge silos.

---

## Relationship With Existing Standards

Detailed coding rules are maintained by dedicated engineering documents.

Examples:

* language-specific conventions;
* formatting rules;
* linting configuration;
* naming conventions;
* project-specific practices.

The Engineering Foundation defines the purpose and role of these standards.

---

## Relationship With Other Frameworks

### Architecture Framework

Coding standards implement architectural decisions.

---

### Testing Framework

Coding standards support testable software design.

---

### Quality Framework

Coding standards provide measurable quality expectations.

---

### Build Framework

Coding standards enable reliable automated construction.

---

### Documentation Framework

Coding standards ensure engineering knowledge remains understandable.

---

## Governance

Coding standards evolve through controlled engineering processes.

Changes may require:

* engineering review;
* documentation updates;
* migration considerations.

Repository-wide coding standards should evolve through documented engineering decisions.

Significant changes affecting engineering practices should be reviewed through the appropriate governance process and, when necessary, supported by ADRs or RFCs.

---

## Success Criteria

Coding Standards are successful when:

* contributors produce consistent code;
* reviews become more predictable;
* maintenance effort decreases;
* automated tools support quality;
* the codebase remains understandable over time.

---

## Final Statement

Coding Standards establish the shared engineering expectations that allow FamilyOS contributors to build software consistently.

They provide the bridge between engineering principles and practical implementation while ensuring that every component contributes to a maintainable, scalable, reliable, and sustainable engineering platform.
