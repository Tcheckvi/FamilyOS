# Engineering Foundation

## 23 — Implementation Checklist

**EPIC:** EPIC-ENG-001
**Title:** Engineering Foundation
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** Completed
**Validation Date:** 2026-08-11
**Target Publication Tag:** `v5.2.0-engineering-foundation`

---

## 1. Purpose

This checklist records the implementation and validation state of EPIC-ENG-001 — Engineering Foundation.

It provides the final operational verification that the Engineering Foundation:

* contains its complete canonical documentation set;
* defines the required engineering baseline;
* integrates correctly with specialized FamilyOS engineering frameworks;
* satisfies its documentation requirements;
* satisfies its repository quality gates;
* satisfies its validation requirements;
* is ready for final repository publication.

This checklist is an implementation and closure control artifact.

It does not replace the detailed architectural, engineering, testing, quality, build, release, or governance specifications owned by their respective FamilyOS frameworks.

---

## 2. Completion Model

EPIC-ENG-001 completion is evaluated across the following areas:

```text
Canonical Structure
        │
        ▼
Engineering Documentation
        │
        ▼
Framework Boundaries
        │
