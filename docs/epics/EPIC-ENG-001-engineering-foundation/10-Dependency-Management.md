# 10 Dependency Management

## Context

Software systems depend on external libraries, frameworks, tools, and internal components.

As FamilyOS evolves into a modular ecosystem, dependency management becomes a critical engineering capability.

Poor dependency control can introduce:

* security risks;
* compatibility problems;
* maintenance complexity;
* unpredictable behavior.

Dependency Management defines how FamilyOS controls and evolves its dependencies.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of Dependency Management is to ensure that dependencies are:

* intentional;
* controlled;
* traceable;
* maintainable;
* compatible with platform evolution.

Dependencies should support the architecture rather than define it.

---

## Dependency Management Principles

### Principle 1 — Explicit Dependencies

Every dependency must have a clear purpose.

Dependencies should be:

* declared explicitly;
* documented when significant;
* reviewed when introduced.

Hidden or unnecessary dependencies increase complexity.

---

### Principle 2 — Minimize Dependency Complexity

FamilyOS should avoid unnecessary dependency growth.

Before adding a dependency, contributors should evaluate:

* whether the functionality is required;
* whether existing capabilities can solve the problem;
* whether the dependency introduces unnecessary complexity.

---

### Principle 3 — Stable Dependency Foundations

Dependencies should be selected with long-term stability in mind.

Evaluation should consider:

* maturity;
* maintenance activity;
* compatibility;
* ecosystem adoption.

Short-term convenience should not outweigh long-term sustainability.

---

### Principle 4 — Controlled Evolution

Dependencies must evolve through controlled processes.

Updates should consider:

* compatibility impact;
* security impact;
* migration effort;
* testing requirements.

Dependency updates are engineering changes, not simple replacements.

---

### Principle 5 — Security Awareness

Dependencies are part of the FamilyOS security surface.

Dependency management should consider:

* vulnerability monitoring;
* trusted sources;
* update policies;
* security impact analysis.

---

## Dependency Categories

FamilyOS dependencies are categorized as follows.

```text
Dependencies

├── Runtime Dependencies
│
├── Development Dependencies
│
├── Testing Dependencies
│
├── Build Dependencies
│
├── Tooling Dependencies
│
└── Internal Platform Dependencies
```

Each category has distinct engineering responsibilities and lifecycle requirements.

---

## Runtime Dependencies

Runtime dependencies are required for application execution.

They directly affect:

* reliability;
* compatibility;
* user experience.

---

## Development Dependencies

Development dependencies support engineering activities.

Examples include:

* formatting tools;
* static analysis;
* type checking;
* development utilities.

They should improve engineering productivity without introducing unnecessary complexity.

---

## Testing Dependencies

Testing dependencies support validation.

They enable:

* reliable test execution;
* repeatable validation;
* quality measurement.

Reference:

* EPIC-TST-001 — Testing Framework

---

## Build Dependencies

Build dependencies support:

* compilation;
* packaging;
* artifact generation.

Reference:

* EPIC-BLD-001 — Build Framework

---

## Tooling Dependencies

Tooling dependencies support the engineering environment.

They should remain aligned with:

* developer workflows;
* automation requirements;
* repository standards.

---

## Internal Dependencies

FamilyOS components may depend on internal modules and plugins.

Internal dependencies should respect:

* architectural boundaries;
* stable contracts;
* domain ownership.

---

## Dependency Selection Process

Before introducing a dependency, contributors should evaluate:

```text
Need Identification
        │
        ▼
Technical Evaluation
        │
        ▼
Compatibility Review
        │
        ▼
Security Review
        │
        ▼
Validation
        │
        ▼
Integration
```

Only validated dependencies should become part of the engineering platform.

---

## Dependency Lifecycle

Every dependency should have a managed lifecycle.

```text
Evaluation
      │
      ▼
Approval
      │
      ▼
Integration
      │
      ▼
Monitoring
      │
      ▼
Upgrade
      │
      ▼
Deprecation
      │
      ▼
Removal
```

Lifecycle management ensures that obsolete, insecure, or unsupported dependencies do not remain in the platform.

---

## Dependency Version Management

Dependency versions should be:

* explicitly controlled;
* reproducible;
* reviewed.

Version changes should consider:

* breaking changes;
* migration requirements;
* validation impact.

---

## Dependency Updates

Dependency updates should follow engineering workflows.

An update may require:

* testing;
* documentation changes;
* compatibility verification;
* release notes.

---

## Dependency and Architecture

Dependencies must support architectural principles.

They should never:

* create unwanted coupling;
* bypass domain boundaries;
* introduce architectural instability.

Dependency direction must remain intentional.

---

## Dependency and Build Systems

Build processes rely on controlled dependencies.

A reliable dependency model enables:

* reproducible builds;
* predictable validation;
* consistent releases.

Reference:

* EPIC-BLD-001 — Build Framework

---

## Dependency and Release Management

Dependency changes may affect releases.

Release processes should track:

* dependency changes;
* compatibility impact;
* security updates.

Reference:

* EPIC-REL-001 — Release Framework

---

## Dependency Documentation

Important dependency decisions should remain documented.

Documentation may include:

* reasons for adoption;
* alternatives considered;
* compatibility constraints.

Possible artifacts:

* ADR;
* RFC;
* specifications.

---

## Dependency Maintenance

Dependencies should be periodically reviewed.

Maintenance activities include:

* update evaluation;
* vulnerability assessment;
* unused dependency removal;
* compatibility verification.

---

## Governance

Dependency decisions follow engineering governance rules.

Major dependency changes should be reviewed according to documented engineering processes.

Architecturally significant dependency changes should be supported by ADRs or RFCs.

---

## Success Criteria

Dependency Management is successful when:

* dependencies remain controlled;
* unnecessary complexity is avoided;
* updates are predictable;
* security risks are reduced;
* architecture remains stable.

---

## Final Statement

Dependency Management provides the engineering discipline required to evolve the FamilyOS ecosystem safely.

By managing dependencies throughout their complete lifecycle, FamilyOS maintains architectural integrity, engineering reliability, long-term maintainability, and sustainable platform evolution.
