# EPIC-ENG-001 — Engineering Foundation Revision History

## Document Purpose

This document records the evolution of EPIC-ENG-001 — Engineering Foundation.

It preserves the historical development, normalization, validation, governance, and publication context of the Engineering Foundation.

The revision history distinguishes between:

* EPIC document versioning;
* repository-wide release tagging;
* historical immutable release states;
* canonical structure normalization;
* final validation;
* final publication preparation.

---

## Current EPIC State

| Field                  | Value                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| EPIC                   | EPIC-ENG-001                    |
| Title                  | Engineering Foundation          |
| EPIC Version           | 1.0.0                           |
| Status                 | Completed                       |
| Validation Result      | PASS                            |
| Validation Date        | 2026-08-11                      |
| Target Publication Tag | `v5.2.0-engineering-foundation` |
| Publication State      | Ready for publication           |

---

## Versioning Model

EPIC-ENG-001 uses two distinct version identities.

### EPIC Document Version

The Engineering Foundation document contract uses:

```text
1.0.0
```

This version identifies the canonical content and contract of EPIC-ENG-001.

---

### Repository Release Version

FamilyOS repository publication uses repository-wide release tags.

Repository tags may therefore use a version identifier that differs from the EPIC document version.

The EPIC document version and repository release tag represent different concerns and MUST NOT be treated as interchangeable.

## Historical Engineering Foundation Evolution

The Engineering Foundation has evolved through multiple repository states.

Historical release tags include:

```text
v4.0.0-engineering-foundation
v4.1.0-engineering-platform-foundation
v4.1.1-engineering-platform-foundation
v4.3.0-engineering-platform-foundation-complete
```

These tags represent historical immutable repository states.

They MUST NOT be deleted, moved, rewritten, or repurposed as part of the current Engineering Foundation normalization.

---

## Historical `v4.0.0-engineering-foundation`

The repository contains:

```text
v4.0.0-engineering-foundation
```

This tag represents a previous Engineering Foundation repository state.

It remains historically valid.

The current normalization does not replace or rewrite this tag.

Instead, the current completed baseline is published separately using the current repository-wide release sequence.

---

## Engineering Platform Foundation Evolution

Following the historical Engineering Foundation baseline, the repository introduced Engineering Platform Foundation states including:

```text
v4.1.0-engineering-platform-foundation
v4.1.1-engineering-platform-foundation
v4.3.0-engineering-platform-foundation-complete
```

These releases remain part of the FamilyOS engineering history.

Their existence does not invalidate the current canonical EPIC-ENG-001 normalization.

The current work consolidates and validates the canonical Engineering Foundation documentation independently from those immutable historical tags.

---

## Canonical Structure Review

On 2026-08-11, EPIC-ENG-001 underwent a complete canonical structure review.

The review identified the intended canonical Engineering Foundation structure as:

```text
24 numbered documents
7 control documents
31 canonical files
```

Canonical numbered range:

```text
00-23
```

The review confirmed that the Engineering Foundation required structural normalization before final closure.

---

## Context Document Normalization

The canonical context document is:

```text
01-Context.md
```

The former duplicate:

```text
01-Introduction.md
```

was removed from the canonical Engineering Foundation structure.

Historical references to `01-Introduction.md` remain permitted only where they document its removal or previous repository state.

The obsolete document is no longer an active canonical deliverable.

---

## Canonical Numbered Documents

The final numbered document inventory is:

```text
00-EPIC.md
01-Context.md
02-Vision.md
03-Engineering-Principles.md
04-Repository-Architecture.md
05-Development-Workflow.md
06-Coding-Standards.md
07-Project-Structure.md
08-Toolchain.md
09-Environment-Management.md
10-Dependency-Management.md
11-Configuration-Management.md
12-Build-Philosophy.md
13-Testing-Philosophy.md
14-Documentation-Philosophy.md
15-Quality-Philosophy.md
16-Technical-Governance.md
17-Engineering-Lifecycle.md
18-Roadmap.md
19-References.md
20-Validation.md
21-Summary.md
22-Release.md
23-Implementation-Checklist.md
```

Validation result:

```text
24 / 24 present
PASS
```

---

## Canonical Control Documents

The final control-document inventory is:

```text
EPIC-ENG-001.md
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

Validation result:

```text
7 / 7 present
PASS
```

---

## Canonical Repository Inventory

Final canonical repository structure:

| Category           | Count |
| ------------------ | ----: |
| Numbered documents |    24 |
| Control documents  |     7 |
| Canonical files    |    31 |

Validation result:

```text
PASS
```

No canonical documents are missing.

No unexpected numbered documents remain.

---

## EPIC YAML Normalization

`EPIC.yaml` was normalized to represent the canonical Engineering Foundation contract.

Validated identity:

```yaml
id: EPIC-ENG-001
version: 1.0.0
status: completed
```

Validated structure:

```yaml
structure:
  numbered_documents: 24
  canonical_document_range: "00-23"
  control_documents: 7
  canonical_files: 31
```

Declared deliverables:

```text
31
```

Missing deliverables:

```text
[]
```

Result:

```text
EPIC contract validation: PASS
```

---

## Engineering Scope Consolidation

The Engineering Foundation was consolidated around shared engineering responsibilities.

EPIC-ENG-001 defines:

* engineering context;
* engineering vision;
* engineering principles;
* repository architecture;
* development workflow;
* coding standards;
* project structure;
* toolchain expectations;
* environment management;
* dependency management;
* configuration management;
* build philosophy;
* testing philosophy;
* documentation philosophy;
* quality philosophy;
* technical governance;
* engineering lifecycle;
* roadmap;
* validation;
* release preparation.

Detailed specialized framework behavior remains delegated.

```text
EPIC-BLD-001 — Build Framework
```

---

### Release

Detailed release planning, readiness, versioning, candidates, publishing, rollback, compliance, and validation belong to:

```text
EPIC-REL-001 — Release Framework
```

Framework-boundary validation:

```text
PASS
```

---

## Documentation Review

A final Engineering Foundation documentation review was performed.

Review scope included:

* canonical structure;
* canonical numbering;
* canonical deliverables;
* local Markdown links;
* canonical document references;
* legacy active references;
* placeholder tokens;
* English-language consistency;
* metadata consistency;
* framework responsibilities;
* release-state consistency;
* version/tag separation;
* editorial quality.

Final result:

```

No unresolved active reference to an unknown numbered Engineering Foundation document remains.

---

## Placeholder Validation

The documentation corpus was reviewed for unresolved tokens including:

```text
TODO
TBD
FIXME
PLACEHOLDER
XXX
TO BE DEFINED
TO BE COMPLETED
```

No unresolved blocking placeholder tokens remain.

Result:

```text
PASS
```

---

## Repository Quality Validation

Final repository quality validation was executed from:

```text
/Volumes/990 PRO/Project_OS/FamilyOS/familyos-cli
```

Branch:

```text
feature/foundation-engineering-docs
```

Baseline before the final closure commit:

```text
b863d0f

```bash
mypy src
```

Result:

```text
Success: no issues found in 527 source files
```

Exit code:

```text
0
```

Revision validation status:

```text

```

---

## Engineering Review Completion

The Engineering Foundation was reviewed for:

* engineering coherence;
* architecture consistency;
* documentation completeness;
* governance clarity;
* framework boundaries;
* repository validation;
* release readiness.

No unresolved blocking engineering issue remains.

Final result:

```text
Engineering Review: PASS
```

---

## Release-State Correction

During normalization, release documentation was reviewed to ensure that it did not prematurely claim a completed or published state.

The release model was corrected to distinguish:

```text
validated
completed
ready for publication
published
```

The Engineering Foundation is now:

```text
VALIDATED
COMPLETED
APPROVED
READY FOR PUBLICATION
```

It is not considered remotely published until the final branch and tag publication steps are completed.

---

## Repository Release Sequence

Recent FamilyOS repository-wide framework releases include:

```text
v4.6.0-quality-framework
v4.7.0-build-framework
v4.8.0-release-framework
v4.9.0-observability-framework
v5.0.0-security-framework
v5.1.0-operations-framework
```

The next Engineering Foundation publication target is:

```text
v5.2.0-engineering-foundation
```

---

## Publication Tag Availability

Before final closure, the target tag was checked against local repository history.

Target:

```text
v5.2.0-engineering-foundation
```

Result:

```text
PASS
```

The tag was available at validation time.

---

## Publication Governance

The final publication sequence MUST occur only after all canonical control documents reflect the completed state.

Required publication operations are:

```text
Stage closure files
Verify staged diff
Create closure commit
Verify closure commit
Create annotated tag
Push branch
Push tag
Verify remote branch
Verify remote tag
Verify clean working tree
```

These operations publish the already validated Engineering Foundation baseline.

## Final Revision Statement

EPIC-ENG-001 — Engineering Foundation has completed canonical normalization and final validation.

The final canonical repository structure contains:

```text
24 numbered documents
7 control documents
31 canonical files
```

All required documentation, engineering, repository, and quality validations have passed.

Final quality evidence:

```text
Ruff       PASS
MyPy       PASS — 527 source files
Pytest     PASS — 1243 tests
DiffCheck  PASS
```

Historical Engineering Foundation and Engineering Platform release tags remain preserved and immutable.

The canonical Engineering Foundation retains EPIC document version:

```text
1.0.0
```

The target repository publication tag is:

```text
v5.2.0-engineering-foundation
```

EPIC-ENG-001 is therefore:

```text
COMPLETED
VALIDATED
APPROVED
READY FOR PUBLICATION
```

The remaining actions are limited to controlled Git staging, commit, tagging, publication, and remote verification.
