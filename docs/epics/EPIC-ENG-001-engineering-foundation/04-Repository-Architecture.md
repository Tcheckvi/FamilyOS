## 04 Repository Architecture

### Context

The FamilyOS repository is the central workspace where software, documentation, specifications, automation, and engineering processes are maintained.

As FamilyOS evolves into a modular engineering ecosystem, the repository must provide a clear and predictable structure.

Repository architecture defines how engineering assets are organized, discovered, maintained, and evolved.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of Repository Architecture is to ensure that the FamilyOS repository remains:

* understandable,
* scalable,
* maintainable,
* navigable,
* consistent with engineering principles.

The repository structure should reflect the architecture of the platform itself.

---

## Repository Architecture Principles

### Principle 1 — Clear Separation Of Responsibilities

Repository organization must separate different types of concerns.

Examples:

* source code,
* tests,
* documentation,
* specifications,
* automation,
* configuration.

Each area must have a clear ownership and purpose.

---

### Principle 2 — Discoverability

Repository organization must allow contributors to quickly find:

* implementation code,
* documentation,
* specifications,
* engineering rules,
* validation tools.

A well-structured repository reduces onboarding effort.

---

### Principle 3 — Explicit Organization

Important repository structures must be intentional.

Folders should represent meaningful engineering concepts rather than temporary development needs.

---

### Principle 4 — Scalable Growth

The repository must support future expansion.

New capabilities should integrate naturally without requiring major structural changes.

Examples:

* new plugins,
* new domains,
* new frameworks,
* new automation tools.

---

## Repository Organization Model

The FamilyOS repository follows a layered organization model.

## Source Code Organization

The source code structure must reflect application architecture.

Expected characteristics:

* clear boundaries,
* explicit dependencies,
* modular components,
* independent evolution.

Source organization follows:

* Clean Architecture principles,
* Domain-Driven Design practices,
* plugin architecture rules.

---

## Documentation Organization

Documentation is treated as a first-class repository artifact.

The documentation structure supports:

* architecture decisions,
* specifications,
* engineering standards,
* framework definitions,
* operational knowledge.

Reference:

* EPIC-DOC-001 — Documentation Framework

---

## Test Organization

Tests are organized according to software responsibilities.

Test organization should support:

* unit testing,
* integration testing,
* validation scenarios,
* regression prevention.

Reference:

* EPIC-TST-001 — Testing Framework

---

## Engineering Artifacts

The repository contains engineering artifacts including:

### ADRs

Architecture decisions.

---

### RFCs

Technical proposals.

---

### Specifications

Formal requirements and contracts.

---

### EPICs

Large engineering initiatives.

---

## Repository Ownership

Repository areas should have clear ownership.

Example:

| Area          | Responsibility             |
| ------------- | -------------------------- |
| Source Code   | Development Teams          |
| Documentation | Documentation Owners       |
| Tests         | Engineering Teams          |
| Architecture  | Architects                 |
| Automation    | Engineering Tooling Owners |

---

## Repository Evolution

Repository changes should follow controlled evolution.

Changes affecting structure should consider:

* existing references,
* contributor impact,
* automation impact,
* documentation updates.

---

## Architectural Constraints

Repository organization shall preserve:

* clear dependency direction,
* separation of engineering concerns,
* stable public documentation paths,
* backward-compatible repository evolution whenever practical.

Structural changes should not introduce ambiguity or duplicate responsibilities.

---

## Repository Validation

Repository health should be verified through:

* automated checks,
* structural validation,
* documentation validation,
* test execution.

---

## Relationship With Engineering Domains

Repository Architecture supports:

### Development Workflow

Provides the workspace where development activities occur.

---

### Testing Framework

Provides organization for validation artifacts.

---

### Documentation Framework

Provides location and structure for knowledge artifacts.

---

### Build Framework

Provides inputs required for software construction.

---

### Release Framework

Provides traceable release artifacts.

---

## Governance

Repository architecture changes should be reviewed when they impact:

* project structure,
* engineering workflows,
* automation,
* contributor experience.

Major structural changes may require:

* ADR,
* RFC,
* migration documentation.

---

## Success Criteria

Repository Architecture is successful when:

* contributors can navigate the repository easily;
* engineering artifacts are organized consistently;
* automation can operate reliably;
* future growth remains manageable;
* repository evolution remains controlled.

---

## Final Statement

Repository Architecture provides the structural foundation that allows FamilyOS engineering activities to scale.

A well-organized repository enables better collaboration, stronger automation, and sustainable long-term evolution.
