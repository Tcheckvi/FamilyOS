## 1. Purpose

This changelog records the evolution, normalization, validation, and closure of EPIC-ENG-001 — Engineering Foundation.

It preserves:

* canonical structure changes;
* documentation changes;
* engineering governance changes;
* validation milestones;
* repository-quality evidence;
* framework-boundary decisions;
* historical repository-tag context;
* final completion evidence;
* publication preparation.

This changelog distinguishes between:

1. EPIC implementation and validation completion;
2. repository publication operations.

The Engineering Foundation is complete and validated.

The final Git commit and publication tag remain repository publication operations to be executed after staging and final diff verification.

## 3. Canonical Structure Normalization

The Engineering Foundation canonical structure has been normalized.

Final structure:

| Category                 |   Count |
| ------------------------ | ------: |
| Numbered documents       |      24 |
| Canonical numbered range | `00-23` |
| Control documents        |       7 |
| Total canonical files    |      31 |

Canonical numbered documents:

```text
00-EPIC.md
01-Context.md

MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

Result:

```text
24 numbered documents
7 control documents
31 canonical files
PASS
```

---

## 4. Context Document Normalization

`01-Context.md` is the canonical Engineering Foundation context document.

The former duplicate:

```text
01-Introduction.md
```

has been removed from the canonical structure.

Validation result:

| Check                                                | Result |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| `01-Context.md` present                              | ✅ PASS |
| `01-Introduction.md` absent from canonical structure | ✅ PASS |
| `01-Introduction.md` absent from EPIC deliverables   | ✅ PASS |
| Active canonical references use `01-Context.md`      | ✅ PASS |

Historical references to `01-Introduction.md` are retained only where they document the migration history.

---

## 5. Canonical Inventory Validation

The canonical repository inventory was validated directly against the filesystem.

Result:

```text
numbered_documents: 24
control_documents: 7
canonical_files: 31
missing_control_documents: []
```

Validation:

```text
Canonical inventory: PASS
```

Additional checks confirmed:

* no missing canonical files;
* no unexpected numbered documents;
* no empty files;
* no files below the validation completeness threshold;
* canonical numbering is continuous from `00` through `23`.

---

## 6. EPIC YAML Contract

The machine-readable EPIC contract was normalized and validated.

Canonical identity:

```yaml
id: EPIC-ENG-001
version: 1.0.0
status: completed
```

Canonical repository structure:

```yaml
structure:
  numbered_documents: 24
  canonical_document_range: "00-23"
  control_documents: 7
  canonical_files: 31
```

Declared deliverables:

```text
31
```

Missing deliverables:

```text
[]
```

Contract validation result:

```text
PASS
```

---

## 7. Engineering Scope Consolidation

The Engineering Foundation defines the shared FamilyOS engineering baseline.

The final documentation establishes:

* engineering context;
* engineering vision;
* engineering principles;
* repository architecture;
* development workflow;
* coding standards;
* project structure;
* toolchain expectations;
* environment management;
* dependency management;
* configuration management;
* build philosophy;
* testing philosophy;
* documentation philosophy;
* quality philosophy;
* technical governance;
* engineering lifecycle;
* roadmap;
* reference model;
* validation model;
* release model;
* implementation checklist.

The Engineering Foundation intentionally defines shared expectations without duplicating specialized framework responsibilities.

---

## 8. Framework Responsibility Boundaries

Framework ownership boundaries were reviewed and validated.

| Responsibility                                                                                        | Owning Framework                 |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Testing architecture, levels, automation, evidence, and governance                                    | EPIC-TST-001 — Testing Framework |
| Quality architecture, metrics, evidence, gates, risk, and governance                                  | EPIC-QLT-001 — Quality Framework |
| Build architecture, lifecycle, execution, artifacts, automation, and validation                       | EPIC-BLD-001 — Build Framework   |
| Release planning, readiness, versioning, candidates, publishing, rollback, compliance, and validation | EPIC-REL-001 — Release Framework |

Result:

```text
Framework boundary validation: PASS
```

EPIC-ENG-001 remains the shared engineering foundation and does not replace specialized framework ownership.

---

## 9. Documentation Review

The final documentation review included:

* canonical inventory verification;
* canonical numbering verification;
* local Markdown-link validation;
* canonical document-reference validation;
* legacy-reference review;
* placeholder audit;
* English-language review;
* framework-boundary review;
* metadata review;
* version and publication-tag review;
* editorial consistency review.

Final result:

```text
Documentation Review: PASS
```

No unresolved blocking documentation defects remain.

---

## 10. Repository Quality Gates

The Engineering Foundation requires repository-wide engineering quality evidence.

Final required gates:

```text
Ruff
MyPy
Pytest
Documentation Review
Repository Validation
```

All required gates passed.

---

## 11. Ruff Validation

Canonical command:

```bash
ruff check .
```

Observed result:

```text
All checks passed!
```

Exit result:

```text
PASS
```

Final status:

```text
Ruff: PASS
```

---

## 12. MyPy Validation

Initial exploratory execution using:

```bash
mypy src tests
```

was rejected as the canonical validation command because the test hierarchy contains intentionally non-package parent directories and repeated package basenames such as `capabilities`.

Repository configuration and existing FamilyOS validation documentation confirmed the canonical source-validation command:

```bash
mypy src
```

Final observed result:

```text
Success: no issues found in 527 source files
```

Exit code:

```text
0
```

Final status:

```text
MyPy: PASS
```

No test-package restructuring was required.

---

## 13. Pytest Validation

Canonical command:

```bash
pytest -q
```

Final observed result:

```text
1243 passed in 1.03s
```

Exit code:

```text
0
```

Final status:

```text
Pytest: PASS
```

---

## 14. Diff Validation

Canonical command:

```bash
git diff --check
```

Observed result:

```text
PASS
```

No whitespace errors or conflict markers were reported.

Final status:

```text
Diff Validation: PASS
```

---

## 15. Repository Execution Context

Final repository quality gates were executed from the canonical repository root:

```text
/Volumes/990 PRO/Project_OS/FamilyOS/familyos-cli
```

Branch:

```text
feature/foundation-engineering-docs
```

Validation baseline before final closure commit:

```text
b863d0f
```

The baseline commit was:

```text
feat(plugins): enforce canonical installation identity
```

The final Engineering Foundation closure commit will be created after all closure files are synchronized and staged.

---

## 18. Engineering Review

The Engineering Foundation was reviewed for:

* scope completeness;
* engineering coherence;
* repository architecture;
* workflow consistency;
* quality expectations;
* validation requirements;
* governance responsibilities;
* specialized-framework boundaries;
* release readiness.

Final engineering review result:

```text
PASS
```

No unresolved blocking engineering issue remains.

---

## 19. Documentation Completion

All canonical Engineering Foundation documents are complete.

Final document counts:

```text
Numbered documents: 24
Control documents:  7
Canonical files:    31
```

Documentation completeness:

```text
PASS
```

---

## 20. Placeholder Resolution

The documentation corpus was reviewed for tokens including:

```text
TODO
TBD
FIXME
PLACEHOLDER
XXX
TO BE DEFINED
TO BE COMPLETED
```

No unresolved blocking placeholder tokens remain.

Statements describing placeholder validation requirements are not themselves placeholders.

Result:

```text
PASS
```

---

## 21. Reference Integrity

Local Markdown links were validated.

Result:

```text
Markdown local links: PASS
```

Canonical numbered-document references were validated.

Result:

```text
Canonical document references: PASS
```

No unresolved active reference to an unknown canonical numbered document remains.

---

## 22. Release-State Normalization

Earlier release documentation represented future release outcomes too early.

`22-Release.md` was normalized so that:

* release readiness is separate from release publication;
* `in-progress` remains authoritative until final approval;
* quality gates must pass before completion;
* the publication tag is created only after the final closure commit;
* historical release tags remain immutable.

Following final validation, the Engineering Foundation is now authorized to transition to `completed`.

---

## 23. Version Model

The Engineering Foundation EPIC document version is:

```text
1.0.0
```

The EPIC document version is independent from repository-wide release-tag sequencing.

This distinction is explicitly preserved.

---

## 24. Historical Engineering Tags

The repository contains historical Engineering Foundation and Engineering Platform tags including:

```text
v4.0.0-engineering-foundation
v4.1.0-engineering-platform-foundation
v4.1.1-engineering-platform-foundation
v4.3.0-engineering-platform-foundation-complete
```

These tags represent immutable historical repository states.

They MUST NOT be rewritten, moved, or repurposed.

Historical tag preservation:

```text
PASS
```

---

## 25. Publication Tag Decision

The repository-wide framework sequence includes:

```text
v4.6.0-quality-framework
v4.7.0-build-framework
v4.8.0-release-framework
v4.9.0-observability-framework
v5.0.0-security-framework
v5.1.0-operations-framework
```

The target publication identifier for the normalized and validated Engineering Foundation is:

```text
v5.2.0-engineering-foundation
```

Collision validation confirmed:

```text
PASS: v5.2.0-engineering-foundation is available
```

This tag MUST be created only after the final closure commit.

---

## 26. Release Readiness

Release-readiness conditions:

```text
Canonical Structure       PASS
EPIC Contract             PASS
Deliverable Inventory     PASS
Documentation Review      PASS
Engineering Review        PASS

| Target Publication Tag | `v5.2.0-engineering-foundation` |
| Final Approval         | ✅ APPROVED                      |

The release commit and final tag are intentionally recorded only after publication operations are executed.

---

## 28. Completion Transition

Previous canonical status:

```text
in-progress
```

Final authorized status:

```text
completed
```

The completion transition is justified by successful:

* structural validation;
* documentation validation;
* engineering review;
* repository validation;
* quality-gate execution;
* release-readiness validation.

Result:

```text
EPIC-ENG-001 COMPLETION: APPROVED
```

---

## 29. Publication Operations

The following publication operations remain:

```text
Stage closure files
Verify staged diff
Create closure commit
Verify closure commit
Create annotated release tag
Push branch
Push release tag
Verify remote branch
Verify remote tag
Verify clean working tree
```

Target tag:

```text
v5.2.0-engineering-foundation
```

These operations do not represent unresolved EPIC implementation requirements.

They represent publication of the already validated Engineering Foundation closure.

---

## Final Changelog Statement

EPIC-ENG-001 — Engineering Foundation has completed its canonical normalization, documentation review, engineering review, repository validation, quality-gate execution, and release-readiness validation.

The canonical Engineering Foundation now consists of:

```text
24 numbered documents
7 control documents
31 canonical files
```

All mandatory quality gates passed:

```text
Ruff       PASS
MyPy       PASS — 527 source files
Pytest     PASS — 1243 tests
DiffCheck  PASS
```

The historical `v4.0.0-engineering-foundation` tag remains preserved as an immutable repository state.

The normalized Engineering Foundation EPIC retains document version:

```text
1.0.0
```

The target repository publication tag is:

```text
v5.2.0-engineering-foundation
```

EPIC-ENG-001 is therefore:

```text
COMPLETED
VALIDATED
APPROVED
READY FOR PUBLICATION
```

Final publication requires only the controlled Git staging, commit, tag, push, and remote-verification sequence.
