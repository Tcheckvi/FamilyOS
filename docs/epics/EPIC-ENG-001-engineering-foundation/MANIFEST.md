```text
00-EPIC.md
01-Context.md
02-Vision.md
03-Engineering-Principles.md
04-Repository-Architecture.md
05-Development-Workflow.md

MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md

```

Total:

```text
31 canonical files
```

---

## 6. Canonical Structure Contract

The canonical structure MUST resolve to:

```yaml
structure:
  numbered_documents: 24
  canonical_document_range: "00-23"
  control_documents: 7
  canonical_files: 31
```

Filesystem validation confirmed:

```text
expected numbered documents: 24
actual numbered documents:   24
missing:                      []
unexpected:                   []
```

Result:

```text
Canonical numbering: PASS
```

---

## 7. Context Normalization

The canonical context document is:

```text
01-Context.md
```

The obsolete duplicate:

```text
01-Introduction.md
```

is not part of the canonical Engineering Foundation.

It has been removed from the active canonical filesystem structure.

Historical references to `01-Introduction.md` MAY remain only when explicitly documenting:

* historical repository state;
* migration history;
* canonical normalization;
* removal of the obsolete duplicate.

It MUST NOT appear as an active canonical deliverable.

Result:

```text
Context normalization: PASS
```

---

## 8. Deliverable Contract

The machine-readable EPIC contract declares:

```text
31 deliverables
```

The canonical filesystem contains:

```text
31 canonical files
```

Missing declared deliverables:

```text
[]
```

Result:

```text
Deliverable inventory: PASS
```

---

## 9. File Completeness

Canonical files were checked for empty and abnormally small content.

Validation confirmed:

```text
Empty canonical files: none
Files below 200 bytes: none
```

Result:

```text
File completeness: PASS
```

The canonical documents contain substantive Engineering Foundation content.

---

## 10. Numbering Integrity

The canonical numbered range is:

```text
00
01
02
03
04
05
06
07
08
09
10
11
12
13
14
15
16
17
18
19
20
21
22
23
```

There are:

```text
24 expected
24 actual
0 missing
0 unexpected
```

Result:

```text
Numbering integrity: PASS
```

---

## 11. Document Identity

Every numbered Engineering Foundation document MUST have a clear document identity and responsibility.

The canonical naming model uses:

```text
NN-Document-Name.md
```

where:

* `NN` identifies canonical ordering;
* the filename identifies the document responsibility;
* the document content defines its engineering contract.

The filename is authoritative for repository navigation.

---

## 12. EPIC Machine-Readable Contract

The canonical `EPIC.yaml` identity is:

```yaml
id: EPIC-ENG-001
version: 1.0.0
status: completed
```

The EPIC version identifies the document contract.

Repository-wide publication tagging is governed separately.

---

## 13. EPIC Version

Canonical EPIC version:

```text
1.0.0
```

This version describes the Engineering Foundation document baseline.

It MUST NOT be confused with repository-wide publication tags.

---

## 14. Repository Publication Version

Historical repository tags include:

```text
v4.0.0-engineering-foundation
v4.1.0-engineering-platform-foundation
v4.1.1-engineering-platform-foundation
v4.3.0-engineering-platform-foundation-complete
```

These represent immutable historical repository states.

The target publication tag for the current normalized and validated Engineering Foundation baseline is:

```text
v5.2.0-engineering-foundation
```

The target tag was verified as available before final publication preparation.

---

## 15. Historical Artifact Policy

Historical repository information MUST remain distinguishable from active canonical requirements.

Historical references MAY document:

* former filenames;
* previous repository tags;
* previous engineering states;
* normalization decisions;
* migration actions.

Historical references MUST NOT cause obsolete artifacts to become active canonical requirements.

---

## 16. Engineering Foundation Scope

The canonical Engineering Foundation establishes shared expectations for:

* engineering context;
* engineering vision;
* engineering principles;
* repository architecture;
* development workflow;
* coding standards;
* project structure;
* engineering toolchain;
* environment management;
* dependency management;
* configuration management;
* build philosophy;
* testing philosophy;
* documentation philosophy;
* quality philosophy;
* technical governance;
* engineering lifecycle;
* roadmap;
* validation;
* release readiness.

---

## 17. Specialized Framework Boundaries

The Engineering Foundation intentionally delegates detailed specialized responsibilities.

| Concern                             | Canonical Owner                  |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Testing architecture and governance | EPIC-TST-001 — Testing Framework |
| Quality architecture and governance | EPIC-QLT-001 — Quality Framework |
| Build architecture and governance   | EPIC-BLD-001 — Build Framework   |
| Release architecture and governance | EPIC-REL-001 — Release Framework |

EPIC-ENG-001 defines shared engineering expectations.

It MUST NOT unnecessarily duplicate specialized framework contracts.

Result:

```text
Framework boundary validation: PASS
```

---

## 18. Related Engineering Frameworks

The Engineering Foundation operates as the shared baseline supporting FamilyOS engineering frameworks including:

```text
Testing Framework
Quality Framework
Build Framework
Release Framework
Observability Framework
Security Framework
Operations Framework
Documentation Foundation
Plugin Governance
Plugin Compliance Framework
```

Each specialized framework extends the Engineering Foundation within its own responsibility boundary.

---

## 19. Documentation Validation

The canonical documentation set has been reviewed for:

* structural completeness;
* canonical numbering;
* document references;
* local Markdown links;
* legacy active references;
* placeholder tokens;
* English-language consistency;
* metadata consistency;
* framework boundaries;
* release-state consistency;
* versioning consistency.

Result:

```text
Documentation Review: PASS
```

---

## 20. Local Link Integrity

Result:

```text
Markdown local links: PASS
```

No unresolved blocking local Markdown links remain.

---

## 21. Canonical Reference Integrity

References to numbered Engineering Foundation documents were validated against the canonical `00-23` inventory.

Result:

```text

```

No unresolved active references to unknown canonical numbered documents remain.

---

## 22. Placeholder Validation

The canonical documentation corpus was reviewed for unresolved placeholder tokens including:

```text
TODO
TBD
FIXME
PLACEHOLDER
XXX
TO BE DEFINED
TO BE COMPLETED
```

No unresolved blocking placeholders remain.

Result:

```text
Placeholder validation: PASS
```

---

The Engineering Foundation machine-readable contract requires:

```yaml
quality_gates:
  mypy: required

```text
Stage closure files
Verify staged diff
Create closure commit
Verify closure commit
Create annotated publication tag
Push branch
Push publication tag
Verify remote branch
Verify remote tag
Confirm clean working tree
```

These actions publish the completed and validated Engineering Foundation.

They are not unresolved Engineering Foundation implementation requirements.

---

## 35. Manifest Governance

Any future modification to the Engineering Foundation canonical inventory MUST update, where applicable:

```text
EPIC.yaml
MANIFEST.md
README.md
00-EPIC.md
EPIC-ENG-001.md
CHANGELOG.md
Revision-History.md
VALIDATION.md
```

Changes affecting canonical numbering or file ownership MUST be explicitly reviewed.

---

## 36. Manifest Integrity Rules

The following invariants define the current Engineering Foundation structure:

```text
numbered_documents = 24
canonical_range    = 00-23
control_documents  = 7
canonical_files    = 31
deliverables       = 31
```

The following relationship MUST hold:

```text
24 + 7 = 31
```

And:

```text
declared deliverables = canonical files
```

Current result:

```text
31 = 31
PASS
```
