# Plugin Compliance Framework

## 14 Plugin Certification Integration

### Introduction

Plugin Certification Integration defines how the FamilyOS Plugin Compliance Framework provides structured technical evidence to a separate plugin certification process.

Compliance and certification are related, but they are not the same capability.

Compliance answers:

> Does this plugin satisfy the applicable FamilyOS technical and governance requirements?

Certification answers:

> Has this plugin satisfied the broader conditions required to receive a defined FamilyOS certification?

The boundary between these responsibilities must remain explicit.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of certification integration is to provide a controlled transition from technical compliance to ecosystem trust decisions.

The integration model enables FamilyOS to:

* provide certification-ready compliance evidence;
* determine technical certification eligibility;
* preserve artifact identity;
* preserve evidence provenance;
* expose exceptions and suppressions;
* support manual governance review;
* avoid duplicate technical validation;
* preserve separation of responsibilities;
* support future certification renewal;
* support auditable certification decisions.

The compliance framework provides evidence.

The certification system makes certification decisions.

---

## Certification Boundary Principle

The governing principle is:

> Compliance demonstrates conformance; certification grants a governed trust designation.

A plugin can be compliant without being certified.

A plugin that requires certification should not normally be certifiable without first demonstrating the required compliance profile.

---

## Conceptual Relationship

The target relationship is:

```text
Plugin
  │
  ▼
Compliance Validation
  │
  ▼
Compliance Result
  │
  ▼
Certification Eligibility
  │
  ▼
Certification Review
  │
  ▼
Certification Decision
  │
  ├── Certified
  └── Not Certified
```

The compliance system owns the path through Certification Eligibility.

The certification system owns the final decision.

---

## Compliance Responsibility

The Plugin Compliance Framework is responsible for determining technical conformance.

Its responsibilities include:

* rule evaluation;
* evidence collection;
* finding generation;
* compliance status;
* profile evaluation;
* artifact binding;
* certification eligibility signals;
* structured reporting.

It must not issue final certification status unless certification is explicitly implemented as a separate governed service consuming compliance outputs.

---

## Certification Responsibility

The certification process may evaluate concerns beyond deterministic technical compliance.

These may include:

* plugin ownership;
* maintainer identity;
* provenance;
* organizational accountability;
* security review;
* privacy review;
* licensing;
* support commitments;
* release governance;
* manual architectural review;
* ecosystem policy;
* legal or distribution requirements.

These responsibilities do not belong inside ordinary compliance validators.

---

## Certification Eligibility

Certification Eligibility is the formal bridge between compliance and certification.

A conceptual eligibility state may be:

```text
ELIGIBLE
NOT_ELIGIBLE
INCOMPLETE
ERROR
```

Eligibility must be derived from an explicit certification compliance profile and policy.

---

## Eligible

`ELIGIBLE` means that the plugin has demonstrated all compliance requirements necessary to enter the relevant certification decision process.

It does not mean that certification has been granted.

---

## Not Eligible

`NOT_ELIGIBLE` means that one or more required compliance conditions prevent certification progression.

Typical causes include:

* blocking rule violations;
* mandatory rule failures;
* prohibited exceptions;
* incompatible artifact;
* insufficient evidence trust.

---

## Incomplete Eligibility

`INCOMPLETE` means that the evidence required to determine certification eligibility is not yet complete.

Examples include:

* required manual compliance review pending;
* missing trusted test evidence;
* missing artifact validation;
* unresolved documentation review.

Incomplete must never be interpreted as eligible.

---

## Eligibility Error

`ERROR` means that the compliance or eligibility system could not produce a reliable decision.

Examples include:

* invalid certification profile;
* corrupted evidence package;
* compliance engine error;
* unsupported framework state.

Certification should not proceed normally while eligibility is in an error state.

---

## Certification Profile

Certification eligibility must be evaluated against an explicit compliance profile.

Conceptually:

```text
Certification Profile
├── mandatory rules
├── required domains
├── evidence trust requirements
├── evidence completeness requirements
├── exception restrictions
├── artifact binding requirements
└── eligibility policy
```

The profile remains a compliance artifact.

It does not contain the full certification governance process.

---

## Certification Profile Strength

A certification profile should normally represent one of the strongest compliance profiles available.

It may require:

* all applicable technical domains;
* complete evaluation;
* trusted evidence;
* exact artifact identity;
* no unresolved critical findings;
* restricted suppressions;
* restricted exceptions.

Certification-specific governance requirements remain outside this profile when they are not technical compliance requirements.

---

## Certification Evidence Package

The compliance framework should be capable of producing a certification-ready evidence package.

A conceptual package contains:

```text
CertificationCompliancePackage
├── plugin_identity
├── plugin_version
├── plugin_classification
├── artifact_identity
├── artifact_digest
├── platform_version
├── framework_version
├── profile_id
├── profile_version
├── evaluation_id
├── compliance_status
├── certification_eligibility
├── rule_outcomes
├── findings
├── evidence_manifest
├── exceptions
├── suppressions
└── integrity_metadata
```

This package provides the technical basis for certification review.

---

## Package Completeness

A certification package should be considered complete only when all required certification compliance evidence is available.

Incomplete packages must not be silently accepted by downstream certification tooling.

The package should identify missing elements explicitly.

---

## Artifact Binding

Certification compliance must be associated with the exact plugin artifact being considered.

The target relationship is:

```text
Plugin Artifact
      │
      ▼
Artifact Digest
      │
      ▼
Compliance Evaluation
      │
      ▼
Certification Evidence Package
```

This prevents certification evidence from being reused for a different artifact with the same declared version.

---

## Source and Artifact Relationship

Certification workflows may require evidence for both:

* source revision;
* final build artifact.

Conceptually:

```text
Source Revision
      │
      ▼
Build
      │
      ▼
Artifact Digest
      │
      ▼
Compliance Binding
```

This creates traceability from implementation to distributed artifact.

---

## Evidence Trust

Certification workflows require stronger evidence trust than normal development.

A certification profile may require evidence produced by:

* protected CI;
* trusted build infrastructure;
* approved security tooling;
* authorized manual reviewers;
* attested future validation services.

Unverified self-declarations should not satisfy strong certification requirements.

---

## Evidence Provenance

Certification evidence must preserve complete provenance.

At minimum:

```text
Producer
Producer Version
Execution Context
Source Revision
Artifact Digest
Plugin Version
Platform Version
Timestamp
```

Missing provenance may invalidate otherwise technically correct evidence.

---

## Evidence Integrity

Certification packages should support integrity verification.

The initial implementation may rely on artifact and report digests.

Future systems may support:

* signatures;
* attestations;
* trusted builders;
* signed evidence manifests.

Integrity mechanisms should strengthen the existing compliance model rather than replace it.

---

## Compliance Result Requirement

Certification should normally require:

```text
Compliance Status == COMPLIANT
```

under the certification profile.

A plugin evaluated only under:

```text
development
```

or:

```text
official
```

must not be assumed certification-ready unless policy explicitly states those profiles are equivalent.

---

## Blocking Findings

Any certification-blocking finding must result in:

```text
Certification Eligibility = NOT_ELIGIBLE
```

Typical blocking categories include:

* critical security violations;
* mandatory architecture violations;
* required test failures;
* missing required documentation;
* invalid artifact integrity;
* incompatible platform declaration.

---

## Critical Findings

Unresolved CRITICAL findings should normally prohibit certification eligibility.

Conceptually:

```text
CRITICAL Finding
      │
      ▼
NON_COMPLIANT
      │
      ▼
NOT_ELIGIBLE
```

Exceptions to this principle should be extremely restricted or impossible depending on rule policy.

---

## Warning Handling

Warnings require explicit certification policy.

Possible models include:

```text
Warnings permitted
Warnings require review
Specific warning classes block
No unresolved warnings allowed
```

The compliance result preserves the warning.

Certification policy decides whether it is acceptable.

---

## Exception Handling

Certification workflows must inspect all active compliance exceptions.

An exception valid for development or release does not automatically become acceptable for certification.

Conceptually:

```text
Compliance Exception
      │
      ▼
Certification Policy Review
      │
   ┌──┴────┐
   ▼       ▼
Accept   Reject
```

The certification system may apply stricter exception policy.

---

## Non-Certifiable Exceptions

Some compliance exceptions may explicitly make a plugin ineligible for certification.

For example:

```text
exception_valid_for_release = true
exception_valid_for_certification = false
```

The exact representation belongs to governance specifications.

The semantic distinction is important.

---

## Suppression Review

Suppressions must remain visible to certification consumers.

A suppressed finding should not disappear from the certification evidence package.

Certification policy may require:

* suppression removal;
* formal review;
* justification;
* conversion to a governed exception.

---

## Manual Review

Certification may include manual review that goes beyond automated compliance.

Potential manual reviews include:

* architecture review;
* security review;
* privacy review;
* documentation quality review;
* ecosystem fit review.

These reviews must produce structured governance evidence where possible.

---

## Manual Review Evidence

A manual certification review should identify:

```text
Reviewer
Review Authority
Review Type
Artifact
Decision
Justification
Timestamp
Conditions
Expiration
```

This evidence belongs to certification governance.

It may reference compliance findings and evidence.

---

## Ownership Verification

Certification may require verified plugin ownership or maintainership.

Compliance may verify that ownership metadata exists.

Certification may verify that the declared owner is legitimate.

This distinction prevents compliance from becoming responsible for identity governance beyond its technical scope.

---

## Provenance Verification

Certification may require verification that the plugin artifact originated from an accepted build and release process.

The compliance framework can expose:

* source revision;
* build metadata;
* artifact digest;
* trusted evidence.

Certification determines whether this provenance satisfies policy.

---

## Security Certification Review

Technical security compliance may be necessary but not sufficient for certification.

Certification may require additional security governance such as:

* threat-model review;
* manual code review;
* risk acceptance;
* sensitive capability review.

The compliance framework supplies relevant security findings and evidence.

---

## Certification Decision

The certification system should produce its own canonical decision.

A conceptual model includes:

```text
CERTIFIED
REJECTED
PENDING
SUSPENDED
REVOKED
EXPIRED
```

This vocabulary belongs to the certification framework, not EPIC-PLUGIN-002.

EPIC-PLUGIN-002 only establishes the integration boundary.

---

## Certification Record

A certification record may eventually contain:

```text
CertificationRecord
├── certification_id
├── plugin
├── artifact_digest
├── certification_type
├── compliance_evaluation_id
├── compliance_package_digest
├── decision
├── decision_authority
├── issued_at
├── expires_at
├── conditions
└── metadata
```

This record remains external to the core Compliance Result.

---

## Certification Identity

Certification identity must remain distinct from:

* Plugin ID;
* Evaluation ID;
* Evidence ID;
* Gate Decision ID.

This allows one plugin version or artifact to have multiple certification events or certification types.

---

## Certification Types

FamilyOS may eventually support multiple certification types.

Examples might include:

```text
Official Plugin Certification
Third-Party Plugin Certification
Security Certification
Compatibility Certification
```

The compliance framework must support multiple certification targets through profiles without embedding all certification governance internally.

---

## Certification Target

A compliance request may identify a certification target.

For example:

```text
certification_target = official-plugin
```

The Profile Resolver may then select the required certification profile.

The target must be recorded in the Compliance Result.

---

## Certification Gate Integration

The Certification Gate consumes certification-grade compliance output.

The relationship is:

```text
Certification Compliance Result
        │
        ▼
Certification Gate
        │
        ▼
Eligibility Confirmed
        │
        ▼
Certification Governance
```

This preserves separation between technical enforcement and approval.

---

## Certification Workflow

A conceptual end-to-end workflow is:

```text
Plugin Development
       │
       ▼
Official Compliance
       │
       ▼
Release Compliance
       │
       ▼
Release Artifact
       │
       ▼
Certification Compliance
       │
       ▼
Certification Gate
       │
       ▼
Governance Review
       │
       ▼
Certification Decision
```

Not every plugin must participate in certification.

---

## Certification Renewal

Certification may expire or require renewal.

Renewal may require new compliance validation when:

* platform versions change;
* framework rules change;
* dependencies change;
* plugin versions change;
* certification policy changes.

The compliance framework should support revalidation without mutating historical certification evidence.

---

## Certification Expiration

A certification may expire even when the underlying plugin has not changed.

This may occur because:

* certification policy requires periodic renewal;
* evidence becomes too old;
* supporting platform versions are no longer valid;
* security requirements evolve.

Expiration semantics belong to certification governance.

---

## Certification Revocation

Certification may need to be revoked after issuance.

Possible reasons include:

* critical vulnerability;
* compromised provenance;
* compliance drift;
* ownership change;
* policy violation.

Compliance revalidation may provide evidence supporting revocation.

The certification system owns the revocation decision.

---

## Compliance Drift and Certification

A certified plugin may later become non-compliant.

Conceptually:

```text
Certified Plugin
      │
      ▼
Rule / Platform / Dependency Change
      │
      ▼
Revalidation
      │
      ▼
NON_COMPLIANT
      │
      ▼
Certification Governance Review
```

The compliance framework reports the new technical state.

Certification governance determines whether certification is suspended, revoked, or allowed through a migration period.

---

## Continuous Certification Readiness

FamilyOS may eventually support continuous certification readiness checks.

This means regularly evaluating whether a certified or certification-targeted plugin still satisfies the technical prerequisites for certification.

This does not mean issuing certification automatically.

---

## Certification Status Is Not Compliance Status

The framework must maintain strict semantic separation.

For example:

```text
Compliance Status: COMPLIANT
Certification Status: NOT_CERTIFIED
```

is valid.

Likewise:

```text
Compliance Status: NON_COMPLIANT
Certification Status: CERTIFIED
```

may occur temporarily if a previously certified plugin drifts out of compliance before governance takes action.

The two states describe different concepts.

---

## Certification Status Reporting

Compliance reports should not invent certification status.

They may report:

```text
Certification Eligibility
Certification Target
Certification Evidence Readiness
```

Actual certification status should come from the authoritative certification system.

---

## Registry Integration

A future FamilyOS plugin registry may consume both compliance and certification information.

Conceptually:

```text
Plugin Registry Entry
├── Plugin Metadata
├── Compliance Status
├── Compliance Framework Version
├── Certification Status
├── Certification Type
└── Artifact Digest
```

The registry must preserve the distinction between compliance and certification.

---

## Publication Policy

Future ecosystem publication may require:

* compliance only;
* certification;
* specific certification types.

For example:

```text
Internal Development Registry
  -> development compliance

Official Distribution Registry
  -> official certification
```

Publication policy belongs to ecosystem governance.

---

## Third-Party Certification

Third-party plugins may eventually enter certification workflows.

Their certification may require stronger trust-boundary controls including:

* isolated validation;
* artifact provenance;
* author verification;
* security review;
* restricted capabilities.

The compliance architecture already provides the technical foundation for these requirements.

---

## Official Plugin Certification

Official FamilyOS plugins may use certification to demonstrate stronger platform guarantees.

Official ownership must not eliminate technical validation.

The intended model remains:

```text
Official Plugin
      │
      ▼
Compliance
      │
      ▼
Certification Review
      │
      ▼
Certified Official Plugin
```

First-party origin is not a substitute for evidence.

---

## Certification Evidence Reuse

Certification should reuse valid compliance evidence rather than duplicate technical validation unnecessarily.

For example:

```text
Trusted Release Tests
       │
       ▼
Certification Compliance
```

may be reusable if:

* artifact identity matches;
* evidence is fresh;
* provenance is accepted;
* certification profile permits reuse.

---

## Evidence Upgrade

Sometimes evidence sufficient for release may be insufficient for certification.

Instead of repeating all validation, certification workflows may upgrade only the evidence that requires stronger trust.

For example:

```text
Local / CI Evidence
       │
       ▼
Accepted for Release

Certification
       │
       ▼
Require Attested Artifact Evidence
```

This allows efficient progressive assurance.

---

## Certification Package Validation

Before certification review begins, the certification system should validate the compliance package.

Checks may include:

* schema version;
* package completeness;
* artifact digest match;
* profile validity;
* framework version;
* evidence integrity;
* eligibility state.

Invalid packages should be rejected before governance review.

---

## Certification Package Immutability

Once submitted for a certification decision, the compliance package should be immutable.

If plugin or evidence changes, a new package and evaluation must be created.

This preserves the decision audit trail.

---

## Certification Audit Trail

The full certification chain should be traceable:

```text
Plugin Source
      │
      ▼
Build Artifact
      │
      ▼
Compliance Evaluation
      │
      ▼
Evidence Package
      │
      ▼
Certification Gate
      │
      ▼
Governance Review
      │
      ▼
Certification Record
```

Every major artifact should have a stable identity.

---

## Decision Traceability

A certification reviewer should be able to answer:

```text
Which plugin artifact was reviewed?
Which compliance profile was used?
Which rules were evaluated?
Which exceptions existed?
Which evidence was trusted?
Who approved certification?
When was certification issued?
```

This traceability is fundamental to ecosystem trust.

---

## Separation of Engines

The compliance engine and certification decision engine should remain separate.

Conceptually:

```text
Compliance Engine
      │
      ▼
Compliance Result
      │
      ▼
Certification Interface
      │
      ▼
Certification Service
```

Certification must not depend directly on internal validator implementations.

---

## Stable Certification Interface

The compliance framework should expose a stable certification-facing interface based on structured outputs.

Certification systems should consume:

* Compliance Result;
* Evidence Package;
* Certification Gate Decision.

They should not depend on:

* validator internal classes;
* CLI text;
* transient engine state.

---

## Certification API Boundary

A future interface may conceptually expose:

```text
get_compliance_result()
get_certification_eligibility()
get_evidence_package()
verify_artifact_binding()
```

The exact API belongs to implementation design.

---

## Failure Modes

Certification integration must handle explicit failure states.

Examples include:

```text
Plugin Non-Compliant
Certification Evidence Incomplete
Artifact Mismatch
Evidence Integrity Failure
Unsupported Certification Target
Certification Policy Error
Compliance Infrastructure Error
```

These states must remain distinguishable.

---

## Artifact Mismatch

An artifact mismatch is a critical certification integration failure.

For example:

```text
Compliance Package Digest: abc123
Submitted Artifact Digest: def456
```

Certification must not continue under the assumption that the package applies to the submitted artifact.

---

## Framework Version Compatibility

Certification policy may restrict which Compliance Framework versions are acceptable.

For example:

```text
Minimum accepted framework version: 2.0
```

A technically compliant result produced under an obsolete framework may require revalidation.

---

## Profile Version Compatibility

Certification may also require a current certification profile version.

A previously compliant certification result does not automatically satisfy a newly strengthened profile.

---

## Rule Deprecation and Certification

Certification workflows must preserve historical interpretation when rules are deprecated.

A previous certification record should remain understandable even after the rule catalog evolves.

Renewal may require evaluation under the current rule set.

---

## Certification Exceptions Audit

All exceptions affecting certification eligibility must be easy to audit.

A certification package should distinguish:

```text
No Exception
Approved Rule Exception
Approved Gate Exception
Rejected Exception
Expired Exception
```

This prevents hidden policy weakening.

---

## Certification Conditions

Certification decisions may include conditions.

Examples might include:

* valid only for specified FamilyOS versions;
* valid only with specific dependency versions;
* valid until a given date;
* restricted capability usage.

Certification conditions are governance artifacts.

Compliance may later validate whether those conditions remain satisfied.

---

## Conditional Revalidation

A certification condition may trigger future compliance revalidation.

For example:

```text
Dependency Version Changes
        │
        ▼
Certification Condition Trigger
        │
        ▼
Compliance Revalidation
```

This supports ongoing trust without conflating the two systems.

---

## Certification Observability

The compliance framework may expose metrics relevant to certification readiness.

Examples include:

* eligible plugin count;
* ineligible plugin count;
* blocking domains;
* exception frequency;
* evidence completeness;
* compliance drift after certification.

These metrics support governance improvement.

---

## Certification Testing

Integration requires dedicated tests.

Core test categories include:

* eligible compliant plugin;
* non-compliant plugin;
* incomplete certification evidence;
* artifact mismatch;
* prohibited exception;
* accepted exception;
* expired exception;
* evidence trust failure;
* unsupported profile;
* package serialization;
* deterministic eligibility;
* historical traceability.

---

## Interface Contract Tests

FamilyOS should provide contract tests ensuring that certification consumers can process compliance outputs independently of internal engine implementation changes.

This protects the boundary between frameworks.

---

## Certification Anti-Patterns

The framework must avoid several anti-patterns.

### Compliance Equals Certification

Do not automatically mark every compliant plugin as certified.

### Certification Inside Validators

Validators must not issue certification decisions.

### Origin-Based Certification

Official or first-party ownership must not replace evidence.

### Artifact-Unbound Certification

Do not certify one artifact using compliance evidence for another.

### Hidden Exceptions

Certification reviewers must see all relevant exceptions and suppressions.

### CLI Parsing

Certification systems must not derive decisions by parsing human CLI output.

### Stale Eligibility

Do not reuse certification eligibility after relevant context changes without revalidation.

---

## Initial Certification Integration Baseline

The initial framework should establish:

1. certification profile support;
2. certification eligibility derivation;
3. certification-grade evidence package structure;
4. artifact binding support;
5. explicit exception reporting;
6. structured certification handoff;
7. separation between eligibility and certification.

A complete certification service may be implemented separately.

---

## Future Certification Capabilities

Future evolution may include:

* signed compliance packages;
* certification registries;
* remote certification services;
* trust-store integration;
* certificate signatures;
* automated renewal checks;
* revocation distribution;
* public certification metadata.

These capabilities must preserve the compliance-certification boundary.

---

## Certification Integration Invariants

The certification integration model establishes the following invariants:

1. Compliance and certification are separate capabilities.
2. Compliance determines technical conformance.
3. Certification determines governed trust status.
4. Certification eligibility is derived from an explicit compliance profile.
5. Eligibility does not equal certification.
6. Certification consumes structured compliance results.
7. Certification must not depend on validator internals.
8. Certification-grade evidence preserves provenance.
9. Certification-grade evidence may require stronger trust than release evidence.
10. Certification evidence should bind to an exact artifact.
11. Exceptions and suppressions remain visible.
12. A valid release exception is not automatically valid for certification.
13. CRITICAL unresolved compliance failures normally prevent eligibility.
14. Missing required certification evidence results in incomplete eligibility.
15. Artifact mismatch prevents reliable certification handoff.
16. Certification decisions have identities separate from compliance evaluations.
17. Historical certification and compliance records remain immutable.
18. Compliance drift may trigger certification governance review.
19. Certification renewal may require fresh compliance evaluation.
20. Plugin origin never substitutes for compliance evidence.

---

## Reference Certification Model

The complete reference model is:

```text
Plugin Source
      │
      ▼
Engineering Validation
      │
      ▼
Release Artifact
      │
      ▼
Certification Compliance Profile
      │
      ▼
Compliance Engine
      │
      ▼
COMPLIANT
      │
      ▼
Certification Eligibility
      │
      ▼
Certification Gate
      │
      ▼
Compliance Evidence Package
      │
      ▼
Certification Governance
      │
      ▼
Certification Decision
      │
   ┌──┴───────┐
   ▼          ▼
Certified   Rejected
```

This model preserves the separation between technical proof and governed trust.

---

## Certification Integration Summary

The FamilyOS Plugin Compliance Framework provides the technical evidence required for certification without absorbing certification governance into the compliance engine.

The relationship can be summarized as:

```text
Compliance
    +
Trusted Evidence
    +
Artifact Binding
    +
Certification Profile
    =
Certification Eligibility
```

Certification governance then evaluates eligibility and any additional trust requirements to make the final certification decision.

---

## Final Certification Principle

The governing principle of Plugin Certification Integration is:

> Compliance can prove that a plugin conforms to FamilyOS requirements; only certification governance can decide that the ecosystem should formally trust it.

This separation allows FamilyOS to build a plugin ecosystem that is technically rigorous, auditable, scalable, and governed without confusing verification with approval.
