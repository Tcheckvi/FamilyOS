# Plugin Compliance Framework

## 03 Principles

### Introduction

The Plugin Compliance Framework is governed by a set of foundational principles that define how plugin compliance must be designed, implemented, evaluated, and evolved across FamilyOS.

These principles are normative architectural guidance.

They ensure that compliance remains consistent across plugins, tools, environments, lifecycle stages, and future ecosystem extensions.

Implementation decisions may evolve.

These principles define the constraints that must remain stable.

---

## Principle 1 — Compliance Is Explicit

Plugin compliance must never depend on undocumented assumptions.

Every enforceable compliance expectation must originate from an identifiable platform requirement.

A requirement should be:

* documented;
* understandable;
* traceable;
* versioned;
* associated with an owner;
* evaluable through a defined mechanism.

Implicit conventions may guide early experimentation, but they must not become hidden compliance requirements.

A plugin cannot reasonably conform to a rule that has never been defined.

---

## Principle 2 — Compliance Is Evidence-Based

Compliance decisions must be supported by evidence.

A compliance status must not be assigned solely because a plugin appears correct during manual inspection.

Evidence may include:

* metadata validation;
* manifest validation;
* structural inspection;
* dependency analysis;
* static analysis;
* type checking;
* test execution;
* contract verification;
* security validation;
* quality results;
* documentation validation;
* compatibility checks.

The fundamental relationship is:

```text
Requirement
    │
    ▼
Validation
    │
    ▼
Evidence
    │
    ▼
Decision
```

The stronger the compliance claim, the stronger the required evidence must be.

---

## Principle 3 — Compliance Is Deterministic Where Possible

Deterministic requirements must produce deterministic results.

Given equivalent:

```text
Plugin Version
Platform Version
Compliance Framework Version
Validation Configuration
```

the same compliance rules should produce the same outcome.

This property is essential for:

* reproducibility;
* CI reliability;
* certification;
* debugging;
* auditability;
* historical verification.

Requirements that depend on human judgment must be explicitly identified as such.

Human review must not be disguised as deterministic automation.

---

## Principle 4 — Rules Have Stable Identities

Every compliance rule must have a stable identifier.

Stable identifiers allow rules to be referenced consistently across:

* reports;
* CLI output;
* CI systems;
* documentation;
* remediation guidance;
* governance decisions;
* certification evidence;
* historical records.

A rule identity must not silently change meaning.

If a requirement changes materially, the framework must preserve traceability through versioning or controlled replacement.

---

## Principle 5 — Compliance Policy Is Separate From Execution

Compliance requirements and compliance execution are separate concerns.

The framework must distinguish between:

```text
Policy
  │
  ▼
Rules
  │
  ▼
Validation Mechanisms
  │
  ▼
Evidence
  │
  ▼
Results
```

Policy defines what must be true.

Validation mechanisms determine how that requirement is evaluated.

This separation prevents implementation details from becoming the source of compliance policy.

---

## Principle 6 — One Authoritative Rule Model

FamilyOS must maintain one authoritative interpretation of plugin compliance.

Different tools must not independently define incompatible compliance requirements.

The CLI, CI pipelines, release workflows, and certification processes should consume the same governed compliance model.

Conceptually:

```text
              Rule Catalog
                   │
        ┌──────────┼──────────┐
        ▼          ▼          ▼
       CLI         CI       Release
        │          │          │
        └──────────┼──────────┘
                   ▼
           Consistent Decision
```

This principle prevents compliance fragmentation.

---

## Principle 7 — Compliance Is Classification-Aware

Not every plugin requires the same compliance profile.

Requirements may vary according to:

* plugin classification;
* lifecycle stage;
* trust level;
* release channel;
* deployment context;
* certification target.

However, classification must not permit violation of fundamental platform integrity or security requirements.

Profiles modify applicability.

They do not create independent definitions of compliance.

---

## Principle 8 — Rules Are Composable

Compliance requirements should be organized into reusable rules that can be composed into profiles.

For example:

```text
Metadata Rules ────────┐
Architecture Rules ────┤
Security Rules ────────┤
Testing Rules ─────────┼──► Official Plugin Profile
Quality Rules ─────────┤
Documentation Rules ───┤
Lifecycle Rules ────────┘
```

Rules should not be duplicated simply because multiple profiles require them.

Composition preserves consistency and simplifies governance.

---

## Principle 9 — Compliance Is Domain-Oriented

Rules must belong to clearly defined compliance domains.

Examples include:

* identity;
* metadata;
* structure;
* architecture;
* capabilities;
* contributions;
* dependencies;
* configuration;
* security;
* testing;
* quality;
* documentation;
* compatibility;
* lifecycle;
* governance.

Domain ownership improves:

* organization;
* discoverability;
* reporting;
* governance;
* maintainability.

A rule should have one primary compliance domain even when its evidence crosses multiple engineering systems.

---

## Principle 10 — Automation Is the Default for Deterministic Rules

Any compliance requirement that can be evaluated reliably by software should be designed for automation.

Manual review should be reserved for requirements that genuinely require human judgment.

Automation should be preferred for:

* schema validation;
* naming checks;
* structure validation;
* dependency checks;
* capability declarations;
* contribution declarations;
* static analysis;
* test verification;
* required documentation;
* compatibility checks.

This principle improves consistency and reduces repetitive manual review.

---

## Principle 11 — Compliance Must Shift Left

Compliance feedback should be available as early as possible in the engineering lifecycle.

The preferred model is:

```text
Development
    │
    ▼
Local Compliance
    │
    ▼
Testing
    │
    ▼
CI Compliance
    │
    ▼
Build
    │
    ▼
Release
```

Developers should not discover basic compliance failures only during release or certification.

Local validation and CI validation should use equivalent rules whenever possible.

---

## Principle 12 — Findings Must Be Actionable

A failed rule must help the developer understand the problem.

A useful finding should answer:

```text
What failed?
Which rule was violated?
Why does the rule exist?
Where is the problem?
How severe is it?
How can it be corrected?
```

Compliance tooling must not produce opaque failure states when actionable information can be provided.

The framework exists to improve ecosystem quality, not merely reject plugins.

---

## Principle 13 — Severity Has Defined Meaning

Compliance severity must be governed consistently.

Severity levels must have explicit semantics.

A conceptual model may include:

```text
INFO
WARNING
ERROR
CRITICAL
```

The framework must define how each severity affects:

* compliance status;
* CI behavior;
* build eligibility;
* release eligibility;
* certification readiness.

Individual validators must not invent conflicting severity semantics.

---

## Principle 14 — Compliance Status Is Derived

A plugin must not arbitrarily declare itself compliant.

Compliance status is derived from:

* applicable profile;
* evaluated rules;
* collected evidence;
* findings;
* severity policy;
* framework version.

Conceptually:

```text
Plugin
   +
Profile
   +
Rules
   +
Evidence
   =
Compliance Result
```

The plugin may provide inputs to validation, but it does not control the final compliance decision.

---

## Principle 15 — Compliance Is Versioned

Compliance has meaning only within an explicit version context.

Every complete compliance result should identify at least:

```text
Plugin Version
Platform Version
Compliance Framework Version
```

Where relevant, it should also identify:

* profile version;
* rule-set version;
* validation tool version.

This enables reproducibility and historical analysis.

---

## Principle 16 — Compliance Is Not Permanent

A plugin that is compliant at one point in time is not guaranteed to remain compliant forever.

Compliance may change because of:

* plugin modifications;
* platform evolution;
* rule evolution;
* dependency changes;
* security changes;
* compatibility changes;
* lifecycle policy changes.

The framework must support revalidation.

Compliance should be treated as a verified state within a defined context, not as an irreversible label.

---

## Principle 17 — Compliance and Certification Are Separate

Compliance must remain technically and conceptually separate from certification.

Compliance answers:

> Does the plugin satisfy the applicable FamilyOS compliance requirements?

Certification answers a broader question:

> Has the plugin satisfied the requirements necessary to receive a defined FamilyOS certification?

Certification may include:

* compliance evidence;
* ownership verification;
* provenance;
* security review;
* manual approval;
* release governance;
* support commitments.

A plugin may be compliant without being certified.

A certification policy may require compliance as a prerequisite.

---

## Principle 18 — Existing Frameworks Remain Authoritative

The Plugin Compliance Framework must not redefine requirements already owned by another FamilyOS foundation.

For example:

```text
Testing Framework
    │
    └── owns testing principles

Quality Framework
    │
    └── owns quality principles

Documentation Framework
    │
    └── owns documentation standards

Security Architecture
    │
    └── owns security architecture

Plugin Compliance Framework
    │
    └── determines how those requirements apply to plugins
```

Compliance coordinates existing requirements.

It does not replace their source of authority.

---

## Principle 19 — Evidence Should Be Reused

The framework should reuse trustworthy engineering evidence whenever possible.

If CI has already produced authoritative results for:

* tests;
* type checking;
* static analysis;
* quality gates;
* security checks;

the compliance system should be capable of consuming that evidence rather than unnecessarily duplicating execution.

Evidence reuse must preserve:

* provenance;
* integrity;
* compatibility;
* freshness.

This reduces execution cost while maintaining trust.

---

## Principle 20 — Evidence Has Provenance

Compliance evidence must identify where it came from.

Evidence provenance may include:

* producer;
* tool;
* version;
* timestamp;
* execution context;
* source artifact;
* associated plugin version.

Evidence without sufficient provenance may be unsuitable for strong compliance or certification decisions.

---

## Principle 21 — Failures Must Fail Predictably

Compliance validation must distinguish clearly between:

* plugin non-compliance;
* validation infrastructure failure;
* missing evidence;
* unsupported validation;
* internal framework error.

These states must not be collapsed into a single generic failure.

For example:

```text
Rule Evaluated + Requirement Violated
        =
Non-Compliant Finding

Validator Cannot Execute
        =
Validation Error
```

This distinction is essential for reliable automation.

---

## Principle 22 — Unknown Is Not Pass

The absence of a detected failure must not automatically mean compliance.

If a required rule cannot be evaluated, the framework must represent that state explicitly.

Possible conceptual states include:

```text
PASS
FAIL
WARNING
NOT_APPLICABLE
NOT_EVALUATED
ERROR
```

The final state model will be defined by the detailed specification.

The essential principle is that uncertainty must remain visible.

---

## Principle 23 — Exceptions Are Governed

Compliance exceptions may occasionally be necessary.

Exceptions must never become invisible bypass mechanisms.

Any exception mechanism must be:

* explicit;
* documented;
* scoped;
* justified;
* approved where required;
* traceable;
* time-aware where appropriate.

The framework should distinguish a governed exception from a passed rule.

An exception does not erase the underlying requirement.

---

## Principle 24 — Suppressions Must Be Visible

If individual findings can be suppressed, the suppression must remain visible in compliance evidence and reporting.

A suppression should identify:

* the affected rule;
* justification;
* scope;
* owner or authority;
* expiration when applicable.

Silent suppression undermines trust in compliance results.

---

## Principle 25 — Security Requirements Cannot Be Weakened Accidentally

Compliance profiles and exception mechanisms must not unintentionally bypass mandatory security constraints.

Security-critical requirements may require stronger governance than ordinary engineering rules.

The framework must support rules that cannot be disabled by lower-trust profiles.

This establishes a minimum platform safety boundary.

---

## Principle 26 — Compatibility Is a Compliance Concern

Plugin compliance includes compatibility with supported FamilyOS platform contracts.

A plugin may be structurally valid and well tested while still targeting an incompatible platform version.

Compatibility evidence should therefore participate in compliance evaluation.

Compatibility must be explicit rather than inferred from successful execution alone.

---

## Principle 27 — Lifecycle Behavior Is Verifiable

Compliance must consider the plugin lifecycle, not only static source structure.

Where applicable, plugins should be verifiable during:

```text
Discovery
   │
   ▼
Registration
   │
   ▼
Activation
   │
   ▼
Execution
   │
   ▼
Upgrade
   │
   ▼
Deactivation
   │
   ▼
Removal
```

The applicable lifecycle requirements depend on plugin classification and capabilities.

---

## Principle 28 — Compliance Must Be Auditable

A compliance result must be explainable after it has been produced.

An auditor or reviewer should be able to determine:

* what plugin was evaluated;
* which profile applied;
* which rules were evaluated;
* which evidence was used;
* which findings were produced;
* which exceptions existed;
* how the final status was derived.

Auditability is essential for certification and ecosystem trust.

---

## Principle 29 — Reports Are Structured First

Compliance information should have a structured canonical representation.

Human-readable output should be derived from that representation.

The model is:

```text
Structured Compliance Result
           │
     ┌─────┼─────┐
     ▼     ▼     ▼
    CLI   JSON  Report
```

This ensures that different consumers receive consistent information.

---

## Principle 30 — Tooling Must Not Change Compliance Meaning

The same governed rule set must have the same semantic meaning regardless of whether it is evaluated through:

* local CLI;
* CI;
* build pipeline;
* release pipeline;
* certification infrastructure.

Tooling may change presentation or execution strategy.

It must not silently change policy.

---

## Principle 31 — Rules Must Be Testable

Compliance rules themselves require verification.

A rule implementation should have tests demonstrating:

* passing behavior;
* failing behavior;
* edge cases;
* applicability behavior;
* error behavior.

Compliance infrastructure that cannot validate its own rules cannot provide strong ecosystem guarantees.

---

## Principle 32 — Rule Evolution Is Governed

Compliance rules will evolve with FamilyOS.

Rule evolution must consider:

* backward compatibility;
* deprecation;
* migration;
* severity changes;
* profile impact;
* existing certified plugins.

Breaking changes must not be introduced casually.

A compliance rule is part of the platform contract.

---

## Principle 33 — Deprecated Rules Remain Traceable

When a rule is deprecated or replaced, historical compliance results must remain understandable.

The framework should preserve relationships such as:

```text
RULE-A
  │
  ▼
Deprecated
  │
  ▼
Replaced By
  │
  ▼
RULE-B
```

Historical evidence must not become ambiguous because the active rule catalog changed.

---

## Principle 34 — Compliance Must Scale

The framework must remain practical as the number of:

* plugins;
* rules;
* profiles;
* platform versions;
* evidence sources;
* certification targets;

increases.

Validation architecture should avoid unnecessary global coupling.

Rules should remain independently evaluable where practical.

This supports parallelization, incremental validation, and future ecosystem growth.

---

## Principle 35 — Compliance Must Remain Explainable

Automation must not turn compliance into an opaque scoring system.

Developers and reviewers must understand why a plugin received its status.

If scoring is introduced, scores must not replace explicit rule results.

A numerical score cannot hide a critical failed requirement.

Explainability takes precedence over superficial simplicity.

---

## Principle 36 — Trust Is Earned Through Verification

The framework must never equate plugin origin with automatic compliance.

Built-in and official plugins require validation just as external plugins do.

Trusted ownership may influence certification policy.

It must not eliminate the need for engineering evidence.

This ensures that FamilyOS applies its standards consistently to its own ecosystem.

---

## Principle 37 — Compliance Protects Extensibility

Compliance must not be designed as an obstacle to extension.

Its purpose is to make extensibility sustainable.

The relationship is:

```text
Extensibility
     +
Explicit Contracts
     +
Automated Verification
     =
Sustainable Plugin Ecosystem
```

Good compliance rules protect the platform while giving plugin authors predictable boundaries within which they can innovate.

---

## Principle 38 — The Framework Must Evolve Conservatively

Compliance affects every plugin that participates in the ecosystem.

Framework evolution must therefore prioritize:

* stability;
* predictability;
* migration paths;
* clear communication;
* backward compatibility where appropriate.

Rapid evolution is acceptable during explicitly experimental stages.

Stable compliance contracts must evolve deliberately.

---

## Principle Hierarchy

When implementation decisions create tension between principles, FamilyOS should prioritize them according to platform integrity.

The highest-order expectations are:

```text
Platform Safety
      │
      ▼
Architectural Integrity
      │
      ▼
Deterministic Verification
      │
      ▼
Traceability
      │
      ▼
Developer Experience
      │
      ▼
Operational Convenience
```

Operational convenience must never silently override platform safety or architectural integrity.

---

## Application of Principles

These principles apply to all components introduced by EPIC-PLUGIN-002, including future:

* compliance schemas;
* rule catalogs;
* validators;
* evidence providers;
* compliance profiles;
* CLI commands;
* CI integrations;
* reports;
* certification interfaces;
* governance processes.

Detailed specifications may refine these principles but must not contradict them without an explicit architectural decision.

---

## Principles Summary

The Plugin Compliance Framework is built around a simple model:

```text
Explicit Requirements
        │
        ▼
Governed Rules
        │
        ▼
Deterministic Validation
        │
        ▼
Traceable Evidence
        │
        ▼
Actionable Findings
        │
        ▼
Derived Compliance
        │
        ▼
Certification Readiness
```

This model keeps compliance understandable, automatable, auditable, and scalable.

---

## Final Principle

The governing principle of EPIC-PLUGIN-002 is:

> Compliance must never be assumed when it can be demonstrated.

Every design decision in the Plugin Compliance Framework should strengthen FamilyOS's ability to demonstrate plugin conformance through explicit rules, trustworthy evidence, reproducible validation, and transparent results.
