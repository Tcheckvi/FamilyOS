# Plugin Compliance Framework

## Revision History

### EPIC-PLUGIN-002

### Purpose

This document records significant revisions to the normative documentation of EPIC-PLUGIN-002 — Plugin Compliance Framework.

It provides a human-readable history of architectural and policy evolution across the framework documentation set.

Revision history is distinct from:

* Git commit history;
* framework release history;
* rule lifecycle metadata;
* `CHANGELOG.md`.

Its purpose is to preserve the evolution of the documentation model itself.

---

## Revision Principle

The governing revision principle is:

> Significant changes to the meaning, structure, authority, or interpretation of the Plugin Compliance Framework must remain historically visible.

Editorial corrections that do not alter meaning may be recorded selectively.

Semantic changes should always be recorded.

---

## Revision Scope

Revision history should capture changes affecting:

* framework scope;
* architecture;
* compliance domains;
* rule semantics;
* profile semantics;
* validation architecture;
* evidence semantics;
* finding semantics;
* severity;
* compliance status;
* reporting;
* lifecycle gates;
* certification integration;
* governance;
* security and trust;
* lifecycle;
* roadmap;
* validation;
* release expectations.

---

## Revision Categories

Revisions may be classified as:

```text
FOUNDATIONAL
ARCHITECTURE
POLICY
GOVERNANCE
SECURITY
VALIDATION
LIFECYCLE
EDITORIAL
```

A revision may belong to more than one category when appropriate.

---

## Revision Status

Revision entries may use statuses such as:

```text
DRAFT
APPROVED
SUPERSEDED
```

The initial baseline should be considered approved only after the final framework-definition validation and governance decision are complete.

---

## Revision Record Format

Future revision entries should ideally include:

```text
Revision
Date
Framework Version
Status
Category
Documents Affected
Summary
Rationale
Compatibility Impact
Migration Impact
```

This information allows future maintainers to understand why the framework changed.

in-progress
```

to:

```text
baseline
```

This revision establishes version `1.0.0` as the first approved
framework-definition baseline.

Operational implementation remains governed by the roadmap and is not
claimed by this approval.

---

## Initial Architecture Baseline

The first documentation baseline defines the Plugin Compliance Framework through the following major concepts:

```text
Compliance Domains
Compliance Rules
Compliance Profiles
Validation Engine
Evidence
Rule Outcomes
Findings
Severity
Compliance Results
Reporting
Automation
Compliance Gates
Certification Eligibility
Governance
Security and Trust
Framework Lifecycle
```

---

## Initial Compliance Domains

The baseline establishes:

```text
Identity
Metadata
Structure
Architecture
Capabilities
Contributions
Dependencies
Configuration
Security
Testing
Quality
Documentation
Compatibility
Lifecycle
Governance
```

---

## Initial Profiles

The architecture anticipates profiles including:

```text
development
experimental
built-in
official
third-party
release
certification
```

These profiles are architectural definitions at the framework-definition stage.

Their executable implementation follows the roadmap.

---

## Initial Governance Model

The baseline establishes the compliance rule lifecycle:

```text
DRAFT
ACTIVE
DEPRECATED
RETIRED
```

It also defines explicit governance for:

* severity changes;
* applicability changes;
* mandatory rules;
* exceptions;
* suppressions;
* deprecation;
* migration;
* framework releases.

---

## Initial Trust Model

The baseline establishes that:

```text
Evaluated Plugin
        ≠
Trusted Compliance Authority
```

Plugins cannot control:

* authoritative rules;
* profiles;
* mandatory requirements;
* validator trust;
* evidence trust;
* compliance decisions;
* lifecycle gates.

---

## Initial Certification Boundary

The baseline establishes:

```text
Compliance
    │
    ▼
Certification Eligibility
    │
    ▼
Certification Governance
    │
    ▼
Certification Decision
```

Compliance and certification remain distinct capabilities.

---

## Initial Roadmap

The initial roadmap defines progression through:

```text
Core Models
Rule Registry
Profile Registry
Validator Registry
Validation Engine
Initial Rule Catalog
Official Plugin Pilot
CLI
CI
Merge Gate
Evidence Maturity
Build Integration
Release Gate
Certification Eligibility
Security Hardening
Third-Party Readiness
Continuous Compliance
```

---

## Compatibility Impact

The initial baseline introduces a new framework definition.

There is no previous Plugin Compliance Framework release to preserve compatibility with.

Therefore:

```text
Previous Framework Compatibility Impact:
None
```

Future revisions must explicitly assess compatibility.

---

## Migration Impact

The initial framework definition does not require migration from a previous compliance framework.

Future breaking revisions must provide migration guidance.

---

## Implementation Impact

The baseline creates architecture and implementation requirements for future compliance infrastructure.

It does not itself claim that the following are already operational:

```text
Rule Registry
Profile Registry
Validator Registry
Validation Engine Runtime
Compliance CLI
CI Enforcement
Release Gate
Certification Gate
Third-Party Sandbox
Continuous Revalidation
```

---

## Documentation Validation Requirement

The initial baseline remains in draft revision status until final validation confirms:

```text
30 required deliverables present
0 required empty files
EPIC.yaml valid
Manifest consistent
Terminology consistent
References reviewed
Documentation standards satisfied
Repository diff reviewed
```

---

## Approval Transition

After successful framework-definition validation, the baseline may transition from:

```text
1.0.0-draft
```

to:

```text
1.0.0
```

according to FamilyOS governance and repository conventions.

The final decision must be recorded in:

* `CHANGELOG.md`;
* `VALIDATION.md`;
* `EPIC.yaml`;
* this revision history where appropriate.

---

## Future Revision Requirements

Future revisions should record changes to:

```text
Architecture
Rule Semantics
Profiles
Status Models
Evidence
Severity
Gates
Trust
Certification Boundary
Governance
Compatibility
Migration
```

when those changes materially affect framework interpretation.

---

## Minor Editorial Revisions

Minor changes such as:

* spelling corrections;
* wording clarification;
* formatting correction;
* broken-link fixes;

may be grouped into one revision entry when they do not alter normative meaning.

---

## Semantic Revisions

Semantic changes should receive explicit entries.

Examples include:

```text
Changing rule outcome vocabulary
Changing overall compliance states
Changing severity semantics
Changing certification boundary
Changing mandatory-rule policy
Changing evidence trust model
Changing gate semantics
```

---

## Superseded Revisions

A revision may later become superseded.

Superseded history must remain visible.

The latest framework state should not erase the path that produced it.

---

## Historical Integrity

Revision entries must not be rewritten merely to make previous design decisions appear consistent with current architecture.

Historical records should describe what was true at the time.

Corrections to factual mistakes may be added transparently.

---

## Relationship With CHANGELOG

`CHANGELOG.md` focuses on framework release evolution.

`Revision-History.md` focuses on significant documentation revisions.

The relationship is:

```text
Revision History
    │
    ▼
Documentation Evolution

CHANGELOG
    │
    ▼
Framework Release Evolution
```

Some important changes may appear in both.

---

## Relationship With Git

Git provides exact file-level change history.

Revision History provides architectural interpretation.

A Git commit may contain many edits.

A revision entry explains why those edits matter to the framework.

---

## Relationship With Rule Lifecycle

Individual compliance rules may eventually maintain lifecycle metadata independent of this file.

For example:

```text
Rule introduced
Rule activated
Rule deprecated
Rule retired
```

Such rule-specific history belongs to the Rule Catalog.

This document records framework-level documentation evolution.

---

## Relationship With Framework Releases

Every stable framework release should correspond to an understandable revision state.

A release should not introduce undocumented normative documentation changes.

---

## Revision Review

Before a major framework release, review whether Revision History accurately captures significant documentation evolution.

Questions include:

```text
Did architecture change?
Did policy meaning change?
Did compatibility change?
Did migration become necessary?
Did trust semantics change?
Did lifecycle enforcement change?
```

If yes, the revision should be documented.

---

## Initial Revision Summary

The initial EPIC-PLUGIN-002 documentation effort establishes one coherent compliance architecture consisting of:

```text
30 required deliverables
```

covering:

```text
Foundation
Architecture
Rules
Profiles
Validation
Evidence
Findings
Reporting
Automation
Gates
Certification
Governance
Security
Lifecycle
Roadmap
Validation
Release
Metadata
```

---

## Operational Implementation and Phase 10 Completion — 2026-08-14

The framework version remains `1.0.0`; this entry records implementation maturity and evidence rather than a new framework-definition release.

Implementation history:

* `1519670` implemented the initial compliance models, registries, engine, rule catalog, reporting, CLI integration, tests, and official-plugin pilot;
* `d95a97b` extended the official compliance profile with Ruff and MyPy evidence;
* `504bd19` introduced provider-neutral canonical CI validation using the existing local compliance use case and engine;
* `c2ed8de` corrected the missing Health documentation template exposed by the first real CI execution.

GitHub Actions workflow `Canonical CI Validation`, run `31749853569`, completed successfully at `c2ed8de48822919fa69b670911ecd01a909b0732`. Its uploaded `ci-validation.json` artifact records overall `PASSED`, builtin Plugin Compliance `PASSED`, explicit profile `official`, and all seven dynamically discovered builtin plugins `COMPLIANT`.

Repository tests establish that the CI adapter and direct local compliance use case produce equivalent ordered plugin statuses and rule semantics. Together with the remote execution and structured artifact, this satisfies all four Phase 10 exit criteria.

Current operational result:

```text
Operational Exit Criteria: 12/12 SATISFIED
Phase 10 — CI Integration: COMPLETE
```

Merge, Build, Release, and Certification Gates; exception and suppression enforcement; third-party hardening; and continuous compliance remain future maturity capabilities.

---

## Current Revision State

Current state:

```text
Framework Version:      1.0.0
Documentation Revision: 1.0
Status:                  APPROVED
EPIC Status:             baseline
Validation:              PASS
Operational Criteria:    12/12 SATISFIED
Phase 10 CI Integration: COMPLETE
```

The initial framework-definition baseline has completed validation and
is now the approved documentation baseline for EPIC-PLUGIN-002.

## Next Revision Event

The next revision event should occur when the framework definition
changes materially or when implementation progress introduces new
normative requirements.

Examples include:

```text
Operational compliance models implemented
Rule Registry introduced
Profile Registry introduced
Validator Registry introduced
Validation Engine implemented
Official plugin pilot completed
CI enforcement introduced
Release enforcement introduced
Certification integration activated
Third-party compliance support introduced
Continuous revalidation introduced
```

Future revisions must preserve the distinction between documentation
baseline maturity and operational implementation maturity.

## Final Revision Principle

The governing principle of Revision History is:

> FamilyOS must be able to explain not only what the Plugin Compliance Framework requires today, but how and why those requirements became what they are.

This history preserves the architectural reasoning and governance continuity required for a long-lived plugin compliance system.
