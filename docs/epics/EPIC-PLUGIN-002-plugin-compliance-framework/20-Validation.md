# Plugin Compliance Framework

## 20 Validation

### Introduction

The Plugin Compliance Framework must itself be validated before it can be trusted to evaluate plugins.

A compliance system that is incomplete, internally inconsistent, weakly tested, or unable to explain its own decisions cannot provide meaningful assurance to the FamilyOS plugin ecosystem.

Framework validation therefore covers both:

* documentation and architectural completeness;
* implementation and operational correctness.

The objective is to demonstrate that EPIC-PLUGIN-002 forms a coherent, testable, maintainable, and enforceable platform capability.

---

## Validation Principle

The governing validation principle is:

> A framework that evaluates compliance must itself provide evidence that its own contracts are coherent and reliable.

Validation must therefore produce explicit evidence rather than rely on informal confidence.

---

## Validation Scope

Framework validation covers:

* documentation completeness;
* architectural consistency;
* terminology consistency;
* rule-model validity;
* profile-model validity;
* validator contracts;
* evidence semantics;
* finding semantics;
* status derivation;
* gate behavior;
* governance behavior;
* security boundaries;
* reporting consistency;
* lifecycle compatibility;
* implementation tests;
* official plugin pilot results.

---

## Documentation Validation

The documentation set must be structurally complete.

Validation should verify that all required framework documents exist and contain meaningful content.

The expected baseline includes:

```text id="1d955o"
00-EPIC.md
01-Context.md
02-Vision.md
03-Principles.md
04-Compliance-Architecture.md
05-Compliance-Domains.md
06-Compliance-Rule-Model.md
07-Compliance-Profiles.md
08-Validation-Engine.md
09-Evidence-Model.md
10-Findings-and-Severity-Model.md
11-Compliance-Reporting.md
12-Automation-and-CI-Integration.md
13-Compliance-Gates.md
14-Plugin-Certification-Integration.md
15-Governance-and-Rule-Lifecycle.md
16-Security-and-Trust-Model.md
17-Framework-Lifecycle.md
18-Roadmap.md
19-References.md
20-Validation.md
```

Future framework packaging may add metadata and supporting files.

---

## Empty File Validation

No required normative framework document should be empty.

A simple repository validation may verify:

```text id="wr2qig"
file exists
AND
file size > 0
```

A non-empty file is not sufficient proof of documentation quality, but it is a minimum structural requirement.

---

## Heading Validation

Framework documents should have predictable primary headings.

Validation may verify:

* framework title;
* document identifier;
* expected major sections;
* malformed Markdown headings.

This helps detect accidental document corruption or incomplete generation.

---

## Markdown Validation

Documentation should follow the FamilyOS Documentation Framework.

Checks may include:

* valid heading hierarchy;
* properly closed code fences;
* valid internal references;
* naming consistency;
* no accidental command output embedded in normative prose.

Automated Markdown validation should be used where supported.

---

## Terminology Validation

Key terms must retain consistent meanings across the framework.

Important terms include:

```text id="wbofmd"
Compliance Rule
Compliance Profile
Validator
Evidence
Rule Outcome
Finding
Severity
Compliance Result
Compliance Status
Gate
Certification Eligibility
Certification
```

Terminology drift can create implementation ambiguity.

---

## Semantic Separation Validation

The framework must preserve several critical semantic separations.

Validation should confirm that documentation and implementation do not conflate:

```text id="ea9yag"
Rule
≠
Finding
```

```text id="3s9hga"
Rule Outcome
≠
Severity
```

```text id="9ab0gv"
Compliance Status
≠
Certification Status
```

```text id="c3p86b"
Exception
≠
Suppression
```

```text id="888baw"
Validator Error
≠
Plugin Non-Compliance
```

These boundaries are foundational.

---

## Architecture Validation

The Compliance Architecture should be reviewed against its declared invariants.

The architecture must maintain the sequence:

```text id="jj38yv"
Requirements
      │
      ▼
Rules
      │
      ▼
Profiles
      │
      ▼
Validation
      │
      ▼
Evidence
      │
      ▼
Findings
      │
      ▼
Decision
      │
      ▼
Reporting
```

No implementation component should bypass this model without an explicit architectural decision.

---

## Boundary Validation

Validation must confirm separation between:

* policy and execution;
* compliance and certification;
* validators and decision policy;
* compliance core and presentation;
* plugin-controlled state and compliance-controlled state.

These boundaries reduce semantic and security risk.

---

## Rule Model Validation

The Rule Model must ensure that active rules have sufficient metadata.

At minimum, an active rule should define:

```text id="0s78ae"
Rule ID
Domain
Requirement
Severity
Applicability
Validation Strategy
Evidence Requirements
Remediation
Lifecycle State
Ownership
```

Rules missing required semantics should fail rule-catalog validation.

---

## Rule Identity Validation

Rule IDs must be:

* unique;
* stable;
* valid according to the chosen identifier grammar.

Duplicate Rule IDs must be treated as framework configuration errors.

---

## Rule Lifecycle Validation

Rule lifecycle transitions should be valid.

For example:

```text id="0cfobo"
DRAFT -> ACTIVE
ACTIVE -> DEPRECATED
DEPRECATED -> RETIRED
```

Invalid transitions should be rejected.

---

## Rule Dependency Validation

Rule dependency graphs must be validated for:

* unknown references;
* cycles;
* retired-rule incompatibility;
* invalid prerequisite relationships.

Circular dependencies must prevent activation of the affected policy set.

---

## Rule Test Validation

Every automated active rule should have tests proving expected behavior.

Minimum cases should include:

```text id="vkog2h"
PASS case
FAIL case
NOT_APPLICABLE case
ERROR or missing-evidence case
```

Additional boundary cases should be added where relevant.

---

## Profile Validation

Profiles must be validated for:

* valid identity;
* valid version;
* known rules;
* known parent profiles;
* valid exclusions;
* mandatory-rule preservation;
* severity policy;
* evidence policy;
* lifecycle state.

Invalid profiles must not be selectable.

---

## Profile Resolution Validation

The Profile Resolver requires tests for:

* expected classification mapping;
* explicit override;
* stronger-profile selection;
* invalid profile;
* incompatible classification;
* no valid profile.

A resolution failure must not silently fall back to a weaker profile.

---

## Mandatory Rule Validation

Tests must prove that ordinary profile configuration cannot remove mandatory rules.

Conceptually:

```text id="hdmt40"
Profile excludes mandatory rule
        │
        ▼
Profile Validation Error
```

or equivalent framework-defined behavior.

---

## Validation Engine Tests

The Validation Engine requires extensive unit and integration testing.

Core areas include:

* request validation;
* context construction;
* profile resolution;
* rule resolution;
* applicability;
* dependency planning;
* validator execution;
* evidence collection;
* finding generation;
* status derivation;
* exceptions;
* suppressions;
* deterministic output.

---

## Determinism Validation

Given equivalent validation input, the engine should produce equivalent semantic output.

Tests should compare:

* rule outcomes;
* finding identities or normalized fingerprints where appropriate;
* severity;
* final status;
* effective profile;
* rule set.

Timestamps and execution durations may differ.

---

## Parallel Execution Validation

If validators run concurrently, tests must confirm that parallel execution does not alter semantics.

For example:

```text id="tkykrc"
Sequential Result
      ==
Parallel Result
```

for canonical rule outcomes and final status.

---

## Error Propagation Validation

The framework must test distinction between:

```text id="h2sldb"
Validator successfully detects violation
```

and:

```text id="glpmca"
Validator execution crashes
```

These states must produce different outcomes.

---

## Evidence Model Validation

Evidence infrastructure requires tests for:

* identity;
* serialization;
* provenance;
* freshness;
* trust;
* scope;
* compatibility;
* reuse;
* invalidation;
* conflicts;
* redaction.

Evidence is part of the compliance trust boundary.

---

## Evidence Freshness Tests

Tests should verify that stale evidence is rejected after relevant changes.

Examples include:

```text id="wtsun1"
Source revision changes
```

```text id="maenhs"
Plugin version changes
```

```text id="n4vvlx"
Platform version changes
```

when those dimensions affect the evidence.

---

## Evidence Trust Tests

The framework must verify that a plugin cannot self-declare evidence as trusted.

For example:

```text id="s90abg"
plugin file says trust = TRUSTED
```

must not override actual provenance evaluation.

---

## Evidence Conflict Tests

Conflicting evidence must remain visible.

Tests should ensure the framework does not automatically select the most favorable evidence result.

---

## Secret Redaction Validation

Evidence and reporting tests must verify that secrets are never included in ordinary output.

Test fixtures may deliberately contain fake secrets to prove redaction behavior.

---

## Findings Validation

Finding tests should cover:

* finding creation;
* rule association;
* evidence references;
* severity;
* category;
* location;
* remediation;
* suppression;
* exception;
* serialization.

---

## Severity Validation

Severity semantics must remain globally consistent.

Tests should verify ordering:

```text id="6zgu0d"
CRITICAL > ERROR > WARNING > INFO
```

where ordering is required for rendering or policy.

Severity must not be used as a substitute for rule outcome.

---

## Compliance Status Validation

The decision engine should be tested across all canonical states:

```text id="03d2z8"
COMPLIANT
NON_COMPLIANT
INCOMPLETE
ERROR
```

Each state must have deterministic derivation rules.

---

## Non-Compliant Tests

Tests should verify that blocking failed rules produce:

```text id="50rk8w"
NON_COMPLIANT
```

under profiles where they are blocking.

---

## Incomplete Tests

Tests should verify that required missing evidence does not produce PASS.

Expected behavior should be:

```text id="vl4z08"
INCOMPLETE
```

or a more specific governed incomplete state if later introduced.

---

## Error Status Tests

Framework infrastructure failures severe enough to prevent a reliable decision should produce:

```text id="9e9a01"
ERROR
```

They should not be disguised as plugin non-compliance.

---

## Exception Validation

Exception handling must be tested for:

* valid exception;
* expired exception;
* wrong plugin scope;
* unauthorized authority;
* non-exemptible rule;
* profile restrictions.

Exceptions must remain visible in final results.

---

## Suppression Validation

Suppressions require tests proving that:

* findings remain present;
* original rule outcome remains unchanged;
* suppression metadata is visible;
* unauthorized suppressions are rejected;
* expired suppressions stop applying.

---

## Reporting Validation

All renderers must be tested against canonical Compliance Results.

Tests should confirm consistency between:

* text output;
* JSON output;
* CI output;
* future release output.

Renderers must not derive contradictory statuses.

---

## Machine Schema Validation

Machine-readable reports should validate against an explicit schema.

Tests should include:

* valid report;
* missing required field;
* invalid enum;
* unsupported schema version;
* malformed finding;
* malformed evidence reference.

---

## Cross-Renderer Semantic Validation

A single Compliance Result rendered in multiple formats should preserve:

```text id="5xxu52"
same plugin
same profile
same status
same rule IDs
same severities
same finding semantics
```

Presentation may differ.

Meaning must not.

---

## Gate Validation

Every gate policy requires tests.

Core cases include:

* compliant pass;
* non-compliant block;
* incomplete block;
* error block;
* warning behavior;
* mandatory failure;
* exception handling;
* artifact mismatch.

---

## Release Gate Validation

The Release Gate should be tested against:

* trusted complete evidence;
* local-only evidence when trusted evidence is required;
* changed artifact digest;
* missing documentation;
* critical security failure;
* incomplete lifecycle evidence.

---

## Certification Gate Validation

Certification gate tests should verify:

* eligibility;
* non-eligibility;
* incomplete eligibility;
* artifact binding;
* prohibited exception;
* valid compliance but missing certification-grade evidence.

Passing compliance alone must not imply certification.

---

## Certification Boundary Validation

Tests should prove that the compliance engine cannot directly produce a certification decision such as:

```text id="l30sqa"
CERTIFIED
```

unless a separate certification subsystem explicitly owns that state.

The compliance engine may produce only certification-related technical eligibility information.

---

## Governance Validation

Governance artifacts should be validated for:

* valid owners;
* valid lifecycle;
* known source references;
* activation metadata;
* deprecation metadata;
* replacement relationships;
* exception policy;
* profile impact.

---

## Governance CI Validation

Changes to structured compliance policy should themselves pass CI.

A governance pipeline may include:

```text id="z49lnh"
Schema Validation
      │
      ▼
Rule Tests
      │
      ▼
Profile Tests
      │
      ▼
Gate Tests
      │
      ▼
Documentation Checks
      │
      ▼
Impact Analysis
```

---

## Security Validation

Security tests must validate the compliance trust boundary.

Important scenarios include:

* rule catalog tampering;
* profile tampering;
* validator replacement;
* forged evidence;
* unauthorized exception;
* artifact substitution;
* result modification;
* runtime isolation failure.

---

## Tamper Detection Validation

When critical compliance policy integrity cannot be established, the framework must produce:

```text id="7oeput"
ERROR
```

or equivalent trust-failure semantics.

It must not issue a normal compliant result.

---

## Runtime Isolation Validation

Where plugin code is executed, test environments should validate:

* timeout behavior;
* restricted filesystem access;
* restricted credentials;
* resource limits;
* network controls where applicable.

Isolation capability may mature incrementally, but its behavior must be testable.

---

## Official Plugin Pilot Validation

The framework should be validated against real official plugins.

This proves that the architecture works outside isolated unit tests.

Pilot validation should include representative plugins with:

* capabilities;
* contributions;
* dependencies;
* tests;
* documentation;
* runtime behavior.

---

## Pilot Candidate Set

A representative baseline may include:

```text id="wlwztb"
Security
Health
Finance
Education
Documents
Communication
```

The exact pilot set may evolve.

---

## Pilot Validation Objectives

The pilot should measure:

* false positives;
* false negatives where detectable;
* validation duration;
* finding clarity;
* remediation usefulness;
* validator reliability;
* profile appropriateness.

Rules producing unstable or misleading results should not become blocking.

---

## Regression Validation

Once a rule or engine behavior becomes stable, regression tests should protect it.

Historical bugs should receive dedicated test cases.

The compliance framework must avoid reintroducing previously corrected semantic failures.

---

## Performance Validation

Compliance validation must remain practical for development and CI.

Performance tests may measure:

* total validation duration;
* validator duration;
* evidence reuse;
* cache effectiveness;
* parallel execution benefit.

Performance limits should not encourage weakening validation.

---

## Scale Validation

As the rule catalog grows, tests should confirm that the engine can handle increasing:

* rule count;
* plugin count;
* evidence count;
* finding count;
* profile complexity.

The framework should avoid algorithms that scale poorly without justification.

---

## Repository-Wide Validation

FamilyOS may eventually run compliance validation across all supported official plugins.

A repository-wide validation should produce separate results per plugin.

Example:

```text id="ih6k1r"
security       COMPLIANT
health         COMPLIANT
finance        COMPLIANT
education      COMPLIANT
documents      COMPLIANT
communication  COMPLIANT
```

Aggregate success must not hide per-plugin failures.

---

## Documentation-to-Implementation Traceability

Implementation should be traceable to framework documentation.

Key architecture concepts should map to identifiable implementation components.

For example:

```text id="49kz4g"
ComplianceRule
ComplianceProfile
ValidationEngine
Evidence
Finding
ComplianceResult
```

This helps prevent architecture drift.

---

## Specification Validation

Detailed schemas and specifications introduced after this EPIC should be validated against the framework principles.

A specification that contradicts foundational EPIC invariants requires an explicit architectural decision.

---

## Validation Checklist

Before declaring the framework operational, FamilyOS should verify:

```text id="zg6u1v"
[ ] Documentation complete
[ ] No required empty files
[ ] Terminology consistent
[ ] Architecture reviewed
[ ] Rule schema validated
[ ] Profile schema validated
[ ] Core engine implemented
[ ] Engine tests passing
[ ] Evidence tests passing
[ ] Finding tests passing
[ ] Reporting tests passing
[ ] Gate tests passing
[ ] Governance tests passing
[ ] Security tests passing
[ ] Official plugin pilot complete
[ ] CLI validation operational
[ ] CI integration operational
[ ] Machine-readable report available
```

Not every future roadmap capability is required for the initial operational baseline.

---

## Operational Baseline Criteria

The initial framework may be declared operational when:

1. core compliance semantics are implemented;
2. an official profile exists;
3. a stable initial rule catalog exists;
4. official plugins can be evaluated locally;
5. results are deterministic;
6. findings are actionable;
7. JSON reporting exists;
8. CI can execute validation;
9. blocking semantics are tested;
10. trust-boundary assumptions are documented and enforced for the supported validation mode.

---

## Full Framework Completion Criteria

EPIC-PLUGIN-002 documentation may be considered complete before every advanced roadmap feature is implemented.

The EPIC defines the target framework.

Implementation maturity progresses through the roadmap.

This distinction must remain clear:

```text id="phf0ts"
Framework Defined
        ≠
All Future Capabilities Implemented
```

---

## Validation Evidence

Framework validation should produce its own evidence.

Potential evidence includes:

* test results;
* documentation checks;
* schema validation output;
* official plugin pilot reports;
* architecture review;
* CI results;
* quality checks.

This evidence should support release decisions for the compliance framework itself.

---

## Quality Requirements

The compliance implementation should satisfy FamilyOS engineering quality requirements.

At minimum, expected engineering validation includes:

```text id="niugqn"
Ruff
MyPy
Pytest
```

according to the active repository standards.

Additional security and architecture tests should be added specifically for compliance infrastructure.

---

## Validation Failure Handling

A failed framework validation must block the affected framework release or enforcement stage.

For example:

```text id="cf4qpo"
Rule tests fail
      │
      ▼
Rule activation blocked
```

or:

```text id="sdnvmt"
Profile validation fails
      │
      ▼
Framework release blocked
```

A compliance framework must not knowingly publish invalid policy.

---

## Validation Ownership

Framework validation is shared across relevant governance owners.

Responsibilities may include:

* Plugin Platform Governance — overall compliance semantics;
* Architecture Governance — architecture rules;
* Security Governance — trust and security controls;
* Testing Governance — testing evidence integration;
* Quality Governance — quality evidence integration;
* Documentation Governance — documentation conformance.

The framework should not depend on one individual reviewer for all assurance.

---

## Validation Review

Major framework releases should receive explicit review covering:

* semantics;
* compatibility;
* migration;
* rule impact;
* security;
* evidence trust;
* lifecycle gates.

Automated validation is necessary but not sufficient for major policy evolution.

---

## Historical Validation

Validation records should remain associated with the framework version they verified.

A future framework version should generate new validation evidence.

Historical validation must not be rewritten to imply current compliance.

---

## Validation Anti-Patterns

The framework must avoid several validation anti-patterns.

### Self-Assertion

Do not declare the framework correct merely because it runs.

### Test Count as Quality

A large number of passing tests does not prove semantic completeness.

### Documentation Presence Only

Do not treat non-empty files as proof that documentation is coherent.

### Pilot-Free Enforcement

Do not make broad new rules blocking without validating them against real plugins.

### Infrastructure Errors as Plugin Failures

Do not hide framework defects by blaming evaluated plugins.

### Unreviewed Policy Activation

Do not activate compliance requirements without governance validation.

### Historical Rewrite

Do not modify old results after semantics change.

---

## Validation Invariants

The Framework Validation model establishes the following invariants:

1. The compliance framework validates its own policy and implementation.
2. Required normative documents must exist and be non-empty.
3. Terminology must remain semantically consistent.
4. Rules must be schema-valid and uniquely identified.
5. Active automated rules require tests.
6. Profiles require validation and tests.
7. Mandatory rules cannot be silently removed.
8. Rule dependency graphs must be valid.
9. Evidence trust and freshness require tests.
10. Missing evidence never becomes PASS.
11. Validator errors remain distinct from plugin violations.
12. Findings preserve rule and evidence traceability.
13. Renderers preserve canonical compliance semantics.
14. Gates consume canonical Compliance Results.
15. Certification remains separate from compliance.
16. Security boundaries require adversarial validation.
17. Blocking rules should be piloted before broad enforcement where practical.
18. Framework releases must pass repository quality checks.
19. Validation evidence remains version-specific.
20. The framework must not enforce stronger guarantees than it can reliably demonstrate.

---

## Reference Validation Flow

The complete validation model is:

```text id="8astqn"
Framework Documentation
        │
        ▼
Architecture Review
        │
        ▼
Policy Schema Validation
        │
        ▼
Rule and Profile Tests
        │
        ▼
Engine Tests
        │
        ▼
Evidence / Findings Tests
        │
        ▼
Security Tests
        │
        ▼
Reporting / Gate Tests
        │
        ▼
Official Plugin Pilot
        │
        ▼
CI Validation
        │
        ▼
Operational Approval
```

This sequence provides progressively stronger confidence in the framework.

---

## Validation Summary

The Plugin Compliance Framework must demonstrate the same properties it expects from the plugins it evaluates:

* explicit contracts;
* deterministic behavior;
* reliable evidence;
* strong testing;
* clear reporting;
* secure boundaries;
* governed lifecycle.

Its validation model can be summarized as:

```text id="cwsy6d"
Documented Architecture
        +
Validated Policy
        +
Tested Implementation
        +
Trusted Evidence
        +
Real Plugin Pilot
        =
Operational Compliance Framework
```

---

## Final Validation Principle

The governing principle of EPIC-PLUGIN-002 validation is:

> The authority to enforce compliance must be earned through demonstrated framework reliability.

FamilyOS should therefore enable blocking compliance gates only when the underlying rules, validators, evidence semantics, reporting, governance, and trust boundaries have themselves been validated sufficiently for the assurance they claim to provide.
