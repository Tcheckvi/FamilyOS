# Plugin Compliance Framework

## 05 Compliance Domains

### Introduction

The Plugin Compliance Framework organizes plugin conformance into explicit compliance domains.

A compliance domain represents a coherent area of platform responsibility against which plugin behavior, structure, declarations, or lifecycle characteristics can be evaluated.

Domains provide a stable organizational model for:

* rules;
* validators;
* evidence;
* findings;
* reports;
* governance;
* ownership.

They also help prevent the compliance framework from becoming a flat and unstructured collection of checks.

---

## Domain Model

The initial compliance domain model is:

```text
Identity
Metadata
Structure
Architecture
Capabilities
Contributions
Dependencies
Configuration
Security
Testing
Quality
Documentation
Compatibility
Lifecycle
Governance
```

Each rule belongs to one primary domain.

A rule may consume evidence produced by another domain, but its ownership must remain explicit.

---

## Domain Principles

Every compliance domain should:

* have a clear purpose;
* define its validation boundaries;
* identify authoritative source requirements;
* expose relevant evidence types;
* support deterministic validation where practical;
* avoid unnecessary overlap with other domains;
* produce explainable findings;
* evolve through governed change.

Domains must not redefine requirements owned by other FamilyOS engineering foundations.

They translate those requirements into plugin-specific compliance concerns.

---

## Identity Domain

The Identity domain validates whether a plugin has a valid and stable identity within the FamilyOS ecosystem.

Identity compliance establishes the minimum information required for reliable plugin discovery, registration, tracking, versioning, and governance.

Typical validation areas include:

* plugin identifier presence;
* identifier format;
* identifier uniqueness;
* naming conventions;
* namespace rules;
* version declaration;
* ownership declaration;
* classification declaration.

A plugin without a valid identity cannot reliably participate in compliance, lifecycle, release, or certification workflows.

---

## Identity Evidence

Identity evidence may originate from:

* plugin manifests;
* metadata files;
* package configuration;
* plugin registry data;
* platform registration metadata.

Typical evidence includes:

```text
Plugin ID
Plugin Name
Plugin Version
Plugin Namespace
Plugin Classification
Owner
```

Identity evidence should remain stable enough to support historical traceability.

---

## Metadata Domain

The Metadata domain validates descriptive and declarative plugin information required by FamilyOS.

Metadata is used by platform tooling to understand what a plugin is, what it provides, and what it requires.

Typical validation areas include:

* required fields;
* schema conformance;
* descriptions;
* versions;
* classifications;
* declared capabilities;
* declared contributions;
* dependencies;
* compatibility information;
* ownership;
* lifecycle metadata.

Metadata compliance is primarily declarative but may require cross-validation against actual plugin implementation.

---

## Metadata Consistency

Metadata must not merely be syntactically valid.

It must also remain semantically consistent with the plugin implementation.

For example:

```text
Declared Capability
        │
        ▼
Implementation Exists?
        │
        ├── Yes ───► Consistent
        │
        └── No ────► Compliance Finding
```

The same principle applies to contributions, dependencies, compatibility, and lifecycle declarations.

---

## Structure Domain

The Structure domain validates the physical and logical organization of plugin packages.

Structural compliance ensures that plugin implementations follow supported platform layouts.

Typical validation areas include:

* package organization;
* required modules;
* manifest placement;
* plugin entry points;
* capability directories;
* contribution directories;
* documentation locations;
* prohibited paths;
* reserved names.

Structural compliance simplifies tooling and reduces implicit discovery behavior.

---

## Structural Stability

The platform should prefer explicit plugin structure over heuristic discovery.

A predictable plugin structure improves:

* developer understanding;
* validation;
* packaging;
* loading;
* testing;
* documentation;
* maintenance.

Structural rules should remain conservative and should not constrain implementation beyond what is necessary for platform stability.

---

## Architecture Domain

The Architecture domain verifies that plugins respect FamilyOS architectural boundaries.

This is one of the most important compliance domains.

Typical validation areas include:

* allowed dependencies;
* dependency direction;
* public API usage;
* internal API prohibition;
* layer boundaries;
* domain isolation;
* capability boundaries;
* runtime boundaries;
* infrastructure access rules.

Architectural compliance protects the platform from extension-driven erosion.

---

## Architectural Evidence

Architecture evidence may be generated from:

* source imports;
* dependency graphs;
* module analysis;
* static analysis;
* runtime contract tests;
* architecture tests.

The framework should automate objective architectural requirements wherever reliable analysis is possible.

Human architectural review may remain necessary for requirements that cannot be determined mechanically.

---

## Capabilities Domain

The Capabilities domain validates the capabilities declared and implemented by a plugin.

Capabilities represent explicit contracts through which plugins expose supported behavior to the FamilyOS platform.

Typical validation includes:

* capability identifier validity;
* declaration completeness;
* schema conformance;
* implementation availability;
* registration correctness;
* contract compatibility;
* version compatibility.

Capability compliance ensures that the runtime can interact with plugin behavior through supported abstractions.

---

## Capability Contract Integrity

A capability implementation must conform to the contract it declares.

The target relationship is:

```text
Capability Declaration
        │
        ▼
Capability Contract
        │
        ▼
Implementation
        │
        ▼
Contract Validation
```

A plugin must not expose behavior under a capability identifier while violating the corresponding contract.

---

## Contributions Domain

The Contributions domain validates extension objects contributed by plugins to the FamilyOS ecosystem.

Contribution types may include:

* policies;
* rules;
* recipes;
* commands;
* workflows;
* services;
* integrations;
* templates;
* future registered contribution categories.

Every contribution type must have an explicit contract.

---

## Contribution Validation

Contribution validation may verify:

* contribution identifiers;
* declaration schemas;
* implementation existence;
* registration;
* ownership;
* compatibility;
* dependency requirements;
* duplicate identifiers;
* reserved namespaces.

Contribution compliance prevents uncontrolled extension mechanisms from bypassing the platform's registration model.

---

## Dependencies Domain

The Dependencies domain validates relationships between a plugin and external or internal dependencies.

Dependency compliance is essential for architectural stability and reproducibility.

Typical validation areas include:

* declared dependencies;
* undeclared dependencies;
* allowed libraries;
* prohibited libraries;
* dependency versions;
* plugin-to-plugin dependencies;
* platform dependencies;
* circular dependencies;
* optional dependencies.

---

## Dependency Boundaries

Plugins must not depend on unsupported FamilyOS internal modules.

The intended model is:

```text
Plugin
  │
  ▼
Supported Public Contracts
  │
  ▼
FamilyOS Platform
```

The prohibited model is:

```text
Plugin
  │
  ▼
Internal Implementation Detail
  │
  ▼
FamilyOS Platform
```

Internal coupling weakens compatibility and makes platform evolution unsafe.

---

## Configuration Domain

The Configuration domain validates plugin configuration contracts.

Typical validation areas include:

* declared configuration keys;
* configuration schemas;
* default values;
* required values;
* secret declarations;
* unsupported configuration access;
* environment integration;
* validation behavior.

Configuration must be explicit and validated rather than relying on undocumented environment assumptions.

---

## Configuration Safety

Sensitive configuration must be handled according to FamilyOS security and configuration architecture requirements.

Plugins should not:

* embed secrets in source code;
* expose sensitive defaults;
* bypass platform configuration abstractions;
* silently consume undeclared environment variables.

Configuration compliance protects both reliability and security.

---

## Security Domain

The Security domain validates plugin conformance with platform security requirements.

Security rules may evaluate:

* permissions;
* privileged operations;
* trust boundaries;
* data access;
* secret handling;
* external communication;
* authentication integration;
* authorization integration;
* sensitive capabilities;
* secure defaults.

Security requirements may include non-overridable mandatory rules.

---

## Security Enforcement

Security-critical rules may have stronger enforcement semantics than ordinary compliance requirements.

For example:

```text
Security Rule Failure
        │
        ▼
Critical Finding
        │
        ▼
Compliance Block
        │
        ▼
No Release or Certification
```

The exact enforcement policy is governed by the compliance profile and security framework.

---

## Testing Domain

The Testing domain validates whether a plugin provides sufficient verification evidence.

Testing compliance integrates with the FamilyOS Testing Framework.

Typical validation areas include:

* unit tests;
* capability tests;
* contribution tests;
* contract tests;
* integration tests;
* lifecycle tests;
* regression tests;
* failure-path tests.

The required test depth depends on plugin classification and functionality.

---

## Testing Evidence

Testing evidence should be reusable where trustworthy.

Typical evidence includes:

```text
Test Suite
Test Results
Passed Tests
Failed Tests
Skipped Tests
Coverage Information
Execution Context
Tool Version
```

Compliance should avoid duplicating test execution when valid evidence already exists.

---

## Quality Domain

The Quality domain validates plugin conformance with FamilyOS engineering quality expectations.

Typical validation areas include:

* static analysis;
* type checking;
* maintainability;
* code standards;
* complexity constraints;
* quality gates;
* technical debt policies.

Quality requirements originate from the FamilyOS Quality Framework.

The compliance framework determines which quality requirements apply to a plugin profile.

---

## Quality Evidence

Quality evidence may come from:

* Ruff;
* MyPy;
* quality scanners;
* custom architecture checks;
* test results;
* future code quality tooling.

Evidence must retain sufficient provenance to be trusted during compliance evaluation.

---

## Documentation Domain

The Documentation domain validates whether a plugin provides the documentation required for its classification and lifecycle stage.

Typical areas include:

* plugin overview;
* purpose;
* installation;
* configuration;
* capabilities;
* contributions;
* dependencies;
* compatibility;
* lifecycle;
* usage;
* limitations;
* release information.

Documentation requirements originate from the FamilyOS Documentation Framework.

---

## Documentation Completeness

Documentation compliance should evaluate required information rather than mere file presence whenever practical.

A plugin containing an empty README should not satisfy a meaningful documentation requirement.

The framework should distinguish:

```text
File Exists
    ≠
Documentation Complete
```

Automated validation may verify structure and required sections.

Human review may remain appropriate for content quality.

---

## Compatibility Domain

The Compatibility domain verifies whether the plugin targets supported FamilyOS contracts and environments.

Typical validation areas include:

* supported platform versions;
* minimum platform version;
* maximum supported version;
* API compatibility;
* capability contract versions;
* dependency compatibility;
* plugin-to-plugin compatibility.

Compatibility must be explicitly represented.

---

## Compatibility Matrix

The framework may eventually support compatibility models such as:

```text
Plugin Version
      │
      ├── FamilyOS 1.x ─── Supported
      ├── FamilyOS 2.x ─── Supported
      └── FamilyOS 3.x ─── Unsupported
```

Compatibility claims should be supported by explicit declarations and verification evidence.

---

## Lifecycle Domain

The Lifecycle domain validates plugin behavior across supported lifecycle stages.

Typical stages include:

```text
Discovery
Registration
Activation
Execution
Upgrade
Deactivation
Removal
```

Not every plugin requires every lifecycle operation.

Applicability depends on plugin classification and architecture.

---

## Lifecycle Validation

Lifecycle compliance may require:

* registration validation;
* activation tests;
* safe deactivation;
* upgrade compatibility;
* cleanup behavior;
* idempotency;
* failure recovery.

Lifecycle behavior must not create hidden persistent platform state outside supported mechanisms.

---

## Governance Domain

The Governance domain validates requirements that exist because a plugin participates in a governed ecosystem.

Typical validation areas include:

* ownership;
* maintainership;
* versioning policy;
* release metadata;
* deprecation declarations;
* exception records;
* certification requirements;
* policy acknowledgements.

Governance rules may be more relevant to official and certified plugins than development plugins.

---

## Cross-Domain Evidence

Some evidence sources support multiple domains.

For example:

```text
Plugin Manifest
   ├── Identity
   ├── Metadata
   ├── Dependencies
   ├── Compatibility
   └── Governance

Static Analysis
   ├── Architecture
   ├── Dependencies
   ├── Security
   └── Quality
```

The framework should reuse such evidence rather than generate redundant copies.

---

## Cross-Domain Rules

A requirement may touch several domains.

However, each rule must still have one primary ownership domain.

For example:

```text
"Plugin must not import internal runtime modules"
```

may affect:

* architecture;
* dependencies;
* compatibility.

Its primary ownership should remain the Architecture domain.

This maintains rule catalog clarity.

---

## Domain Ownership

Every domain should eventually have an explicit governance owner.

Ownership responsibilities may include:

* rule proposals;
* rule review;
* severity decisions;
* deprecation;
* remediation guidance;
* domain documentation.

Ownership does not imply that one team must implement every validator.

It defines accountability for the meaning of domain requirements.

---

## Domain Applicability

Not all domains necessarily apply equally to every plugin.

For example:

```text
Development Plugin
├── Identity
├── Metadata
├── Structure
├── Architecture
└── Testing

Official Plugin
├── Identity
├── Metadata
├── Structure
├── Architecture
├── Capabilities
├── Contributions
├── Dependencies
├── Configuration
├── Security
├── Testing
├── Quality
├── Documentation
├── Compatibility
├── Lifecycle
└── Governance
```

This is illustrative rather than normative.

The final applicability model belongs to compliance profiles.

---

## Domain Maturity

Compliance domains may mature incrementally.

A domain can evolve through stages such as:

```text
Defined
   │
   ▼
Documented
   │
   ▼
Partially Automated
   │
   ▼
Fully Automated
   │
   ▼
Certification Integrated
```

The framework should represent domain maturity without weakening the visibility of unevaluated requirements.

---

## Domain Extension

Future platform evolution may require additional compliance domains.

A new domain should only be introduced when it represents a genuinely distinct area of responsibility.

Potential future examples might include:

* observability;
* AI safety;
* data governance;
* privacy;
* performance;
* accessibility.

New domains must follow the same governance, rule identity, evidence, and reporting principles as existing domains.

---

## Domain Reporting

Compliance reports should group findings by domain.

A human-readable report may use:

```text
Architecture
  PASS  12
  FAIL   1

Security
  PASS   8
  FAIL   0

Testing
  PASS   7
  WARN   2
```

Domain-level reporting helps developers understand where compliance risk is concentrated.

The canonical result must still preserve individual rule outcomes.

---

## Domain-Level Status

The framework may derive domain-level summaries.

For example:

```text
COMPLIANT
NON_COMPLIANT
INCOMPLETE
ERROR
```

Domain-level status must be derived from rule outcomes and must not override the canonical overall compliance decision.

---

## Domain Interactions

Compliance domains form a connected system.

Conceptually:

```text
Identity
   │
   ▼
Metadata
   │
   ▼
Structure
   │
   ▼
Architecture
   │
   ├────────► Dependencies
   │
   ├────────► Capabilities
   │
   └────────► Contributions
                    │
                    ▼
                 Runtime
                    │
          ┌─────────┼─────────┐
          ▼         ▼         ▼
       Security   Testing   Lifecycle
          │         │         │
          └─────────┼─────────┘
                    ▼
                  Quality
                    │
                    ▼
              Documentation
                    │
                    ▼
              Compatibility
                    │
                    ▼
               Governance
```

This diagram illustrates relationships, not a mandatory validation order.

---

## Initial Domain Baseline

EPIC-PLUGIN-002 establishes the following initial baseline:

```text
PLUGIN-ID        Identity
PLUGIN-META      Metadata
PLUGIN-STRUCT    Structure
PLUGIN-ARCH      Architecture
PLUGIN-CAP       Capabilities
PLUGIN-CONTRIB   Contributions
PLUGIN-DEP       Dependencies
PLUGIN-CONF      Configuration
PLUGIN-SEC       Security
PLUGIN-TEST      Testing
PLUGIN-QLT       Quality
PLUGIN-DOC       Documentation
PLUGIN-COMPAT    Compatibility
PLUGIN-LIFE      Lifecycle
PLUGIN-GOV       Governance
```

The exact identifier syntax may be refined before implementation.

The important requirement is stable domain ownership.

---

## Domain Invariants

The Compliance Domain model establishes the following invariants:

1. Every compliance rule has one primary domain.
2. Domains have clear ownership boundaries.
3. Cross-domain evidence may be reused.
4. Domains do not replace authoritative engineering frameworks.
5. Domain applicability is profile-driven.
6. Unevaluated domains remain visible when required.
7. Domain evolution is governed.
8. Domain reporting is derived from individual rule outcomes.
9. Security-critical domains may define stronger enforcement requirements.
10. New domains must integrate with the common rule and evidence model.

---

## Domain Summary

The Compliance Domain model transforms a broad concept of plugin quality into explicit areas of responsibility.

The framework evaluates plugin conformance through:

```text
Identity
      +
Metadata
      +
Structure
      +
Architecture
      +
Capabilities
      +
Contributions
      +
Dependencies
      +
Configuration
      +
Security
      +
Testing
      +
Quality
      +
Documentation
      +
Compatibility
      +
Lifecycle
      +
Governance
      =
Plugin Compliance
```

The exact rules applicable to a plugin are determined by its compliance profile.

---

## Final Domain Principle

The governing principle of the compliance domain model is:

> Every compliance requirement must belong to a clear area of responsibility.

Explicit domains make FamilyOS plugin compliance easier to understand, automate, govern, report, and evolve.
