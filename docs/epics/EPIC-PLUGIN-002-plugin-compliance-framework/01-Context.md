# Plugin Compliance Framework

## 01 Context

### Introduction

The FamilyOS plugin ecosystem is designed to provide controlled extensibility across the platform.

Plugins allow new capabilities, domain behavior, policies, rules, recipes, services, integrations, and other contributions to evolve independently while remaining connected to the FamilyOS runtime and engineering architecture.

This extensibility is a strategic capability of the platform.

However, extensibility also introduces responsibility.

As the plugin ecosystem grows, FamilyOS must ensure that plugins do not merely function, but also conform to the architectural, engineering, security, testing, quality, documentation, compatibility, and lifecycle expectations of the platform.

The Plugin Compliance Framework exists to provide this assurance.

---

## Platform Context

FamilyOS has evolved from a core application architecture into an extensible engineering platform.

The platform now includes foundations for:

* domain modeling;
* plugin discovery;
* plugin registration;
* capability contracts;
* contribution mechanisms;
* runtime integration;
* configuration;
* testing;
* quality;
* documentation;
* governance;
* lifecycle management.

This evolution changes the nature of plugin validation.

During early platform development, it may be sufficient to verify that a plugin can be discovered, loaded, and executed.

At ecosystem scale, this is no longer enough.

A plugin may execute successfully while still violating important platform expectations.

Examples include:

* depending on internal implementation details;
* bypassing public capability contracts;
* declaring incomplete metadata;
* exposing invalid contributions;
* introducing prohibited dependencies;
* violating architectural boundaries;
* omitting required tests;
* failing quality gates;
* providing incomplete documentation;
* introducing insecure behavior;
* using incompatible lifecycle assumptions.

Functional execution therefore represents only one dimension of plugin validity.

---

## Evolution of the Plugin Ecosystem

The FamilyOS plugin ecosystem evolves through several maturity stages.

A simplified progression is:

```text
Core Platform
     │
     ▼
Plugin Architecture
     │
     ▼
Plugin SDK
     │
     ▼
Built-in Plugins
     │
     ▼
Official Plugins
     │
     ▼
Plugin Compliance
     │
     ▼
Plugin Certification
     │
     ▼
Governed Plugin Ecosystem
```

Each stage introduces stronger guarantees.

The Plugin Architecture defines how extensions integrate with FamilyOS.

The Plugin SDK provides supported mechanisms for implementing those extensions.

Built-in and official plugins demonstrate those mechanisms through first-party implementations.

The next maturity requirement is the ability to determine systematically whether a plugin actually conforms to those contracts.

That requirement is addressed by the Plugin Compliance Framework.

---

## From Extensibility to Governance

Extensibility without governance eventually creates architectural drift.

As the number of plugins increases, manual knowledge of every implementation becomes impossible to maintain.

Different plugin authors may interpret platform contracts differently.

Without explicit compliance rules, this can lead to:

* inconsistent plugin structures;
* incompatible metadata;
* undocumented conventions;
* accidental coupling;
* duplicated integration patterns;
* inconsistent test coverage;
* inconsistent quality expectations;
* security gaps;
* lifecycle inconsistencies.

The platform must therefore move from implicit expectations to explicit, verifiable requirements.

This transition can be represented as:

```text
Implicit Conventions
        │
        ▼
Documented Contracts
        │
        ▼
Compliance Rules
        │
        ▼
Automated Validation
        │
        ▼
Governed Ecosystem
```

The Plugin Compliance Framework provides the bridge between documented contracts and enforceable ecosystem governance.

---

## Why Runtime Success Is Insufficient

A plugin that loads successfully is not necessarily a valid FamilyOS plugin.

Runtime success proves only that a particular execution path completed without immediate failure.

It does not prove that the plugin:

* follows architectural boundaries;
* uses supported APIs;
* declares all required metadata;
* respects dependency policies;
* satisfies security expectations;
* provides adequate tests;
* satisfies quality requirements;
* supports required lifecycle operations;
* remains compatible with future platform evolution.

This distinction is fundamental.

```text
Plugin Loads
    ≠
Plugin Is Correct
    ≠
Plugin Is Compliant
    ≠
Plugin Is Certified
```

Each level provides a different guarantee.

The compliance framework formalizes the requirements between basic technical functionality and ecosystem certification.

---

## The Compliance Gap

Before the introduction of EPIC-PLUGIN-002, FamilyOS engineering foundations define many requirements relevant to plugins.

These requirements originate from multiple sources, including:

* Engineering Foundation;
* Plugin Architecture;
* Testing Framework;
* Quality Framework;
* Documentation Framework;
* Security Architecture;
* runtime contracts;
* capability contracts;
* contribution contracts;
* lifecycle requirements.

Individually, these foundations define important rules.

However, a plugin author or automated system still requires a unified answer to a fundamental question:

> Does this plugin conform to the FamilyOS platform contract?

Without a dedicated compliance framework, answering this question requires manually combining requirements from multiple engineering domains.

This creates the compliance gap.

EPIC-PLUGIN-002 closes that gap by translating distributed platform requirements into a unified plugin compliance model.

---

## Distributed Requirements

Plugin compliance is inherently cross-cutting.

No single existing framework can determine complete plugin compliance.

For example:

```text
Plugin Architecture
        │
        ├── Architectural Requirements
        │
Testing Framework
        │
        ├── Verification Requirements
        │
Quality Framework
        │
        ├── Quality Requirements
        │
Security Architecture
        │
        ├── Security Requirements
        │
Documentation Framework
        │
        ├── Documentation Requirements
        │
        ▼
Plugin Compliance Framework
        │
        ▼
Unified Compliance Decision
```

The compliance framework does not duplicate these foundations.

It consumes their requirements and determines how they apply to plugins.

This separation preserves clear ownership while enabling unified validation.

---

## Official Plugin Context

The introduction of official FamilyOS plugins significantly increases the importance of compliance.

Official plugins are not merely examples of extension mechanisms.

They represent platform-supported domain capabilities and therefore carry stronger expectations regarding:

* architecture;
* stability;
* compatibility;
* testing;
* quality;
* documentation;
* security;
* lifecycle behavior;
* governance.

As official plugins mature, FamilyOS requires a consistent mechanism for demonstrating that each plugin satisfies these expectations.

Manual review alone does not scale.

Compliance validation provides repeatable evidence that official plugins remain aligned with platform standards.

---

## Future Third-Party Ecosystem

The need for compliance becomes even stronger when plugin development extends beyond the core FamilyOS engineering team.

Third-party plugin authors cannot be expected to understand undocumented implementation assumptions.

They require explicit contracts.

The platform must be capable of communicating:

* what is required;
* what is prohibited;
* what is recommended;
* how compliance is evaluated;
* why validation failed;
* how failures can be corrected.

A mature plugin ecosystem therefore requires compliance rules that are both machine-readable and developer-understandable.

This enables external extensibility without sacrificing platform integrity.

---

## Trust Boundaries

Plugins execute within or alongside the FamilyOS platform and may interact with sensitive platform capabilities.

Depending on their purpose, plugins may access:

* family data;
* documents;
* financial information;
* health-related information;
* communication systems;
* identity information;
* external integrations;
* notification channels;
* AI capabilities;
* configuration;
* platform services.

This creates explicit trust boundaries.

Compliance validation must therefore help determine whether a plugin operates within the permissions, contracts, and architectural boundaries assigned to it.

Compliance does not replace security review.

However, it provides a systematic mechanism for detecting violations of security-related plugin requirements.

---

## Ecosystem Integrity

The long-term stability of FamilyOS depends on ecosystem integrity.

Ecosystem integrity means that plugins can evolve without undermining the assumptions that make the platform maintainable.

Important integrity properties include:

* predictable plugin structure;
* stable integration contracts;
* controlled dependencies;
* explicit capabilities;
* valid contributions;
* reproducible validation;
* consistent lifecycle behavior;
* traceable compliance decisions.

Without these properties, plugin extensibility can become a source of platform fragmentation.

The compliance framework protects against this outcome.

---

## Automation Requirement

Manual compliance review cannot be the primary validation mechanism for a growing plugin ecosystem.

Human review remains valuable for architectural judgment, governance decisions, and certification.

However, deterministic requirements should be automated wherever possible.

Examples include:

* metadata schema validation;
* required-file validation;
* naming validation;
* dependency validation;
* capability declaration validation;
* contribution validation;
* test execution;
* static analysis;
* documentation presence;
* compatibility checks.

Automation improves:

* consistency;
* speed;
* reproducibility;
* developer feedback;
* CI integration;
* auditability.

The framework must therefore treat automation as a foundational requirement rather than an optional enhancement.

---

## Developer Feedback

Compliance validation must not operate only as a blocking mechanism.

It must also help developers produce better plugins.

A compliance failure should explain:

* what requirement failed;
* why the requirement exists;
* where the problem was detected;
* how severe the issue is;
* how the plugin can become compliant.

The intended model is:

```text
Validation
    │
    ▼
Finding
    │
    ▼
Explanation
    │
    ▼
Remediation
    │
    ▼
Revalidation
```

Compliance therefore becomes part of the development feedback loop.

---

## Compliance and Certification

Compliance must remain distinct from certification.

A compliant plugin has demonstrated conformance to defined technical and governance requirements.

A certified plugin may require additional guarantees such as:

* ownership verification;
* provenance;
* security review;
* manual approval;
* release authorization;
* ecosystem support commitments.

The relationship is:

```text
Plugin
  │
  ▼
Compliance Validation
  │
  ▼
Compliant Plugin
  │
  ▼
Certification Eligibility
  │
  ▼
Certification Process
  │
  ▼
Certified Plugin
```

This separation allows compliance validation to remain deterministic while certification can incorporate broader governance decisions.

---

## Lifecycle Context

Compliance is not necessarily permanent.

A plugin that is compliant today may become non-compliant after:

* a platform upgrade;
* a compliance framework update;
* a dependency change;
* a plugin modification;
* a security requirement change;
* a capability contract change;
* a lifecycle policy change.

Compliance must therefore be evaluated against explicit versions.

A compliance result is meaningful only in context:

```text
Plugin Version
      +
Platform Version
      +
Compliance Framework Version
      =
Compliance Result
```

This model enables reproducibility and future revalidation.

---

## Engineering Workflow Context

Compliance must integrate naturally into the FamilyOS engineering lifecycle.

The intended workflow is:

```text
Development
    │
    ▼
Local Validation
    │
    ▼
Testing
    │
    ▼
Quality Checks
    │
    ▼
Plugin Compliance
    │
    ▼
Build
    │
    ▼
Release
    │
    ▼
Certification
```

Compliance should not exist as an isolated final-stage review.

Plugin authors should receive compliance feedback as early as possible.

This supports the shift-left engineering principle established across FamilyOS foundations.

---

## Governance Context

Compliance requirements are platform contracts.

They must therefore be governed.

Rules cannot change unpredictably without affecting plugin authors and existing plugins.

The framework must provide mechanisms for:

* rule ownership;
* rule versioning;
* rule lifecycle;
* severity management;
* deprecation;
* compatibility;
* migration guidance;
* exception governance.

This ensures that compliance remains enforceable without becoming arbitrary.

---

## Strategic Context

The Plugin Compliance Framework represents a transition in FamilyOS platform maturity.

Before compliance governance, the platform can answer:

> Can this plugin run?

After compliance governance, the platform can answer:

> Does this plugin conform to the FamilyOS engineering contract?

Certification can later answer an even stronger question:

> Is this plugin trusted and approved for a defined FamilyOS ecosystem context?

These distinctions establish a scalable trust model for the plugin ecosystem.

---

## Context Summary

EPIC-PLUGIN-002 exists because FamilyOS has reached a level of plugin maturity where implicit conventions and runtime validation are no longer sufficient.

The platform now requires:

* explicit compliance requirements;
* unified interpretation of distributed engineering standards;
* automated validation;
* structured findings;
* reproducible compliance decisions;
* lifecycle-aware evaluation;
* integration with engineering workflows;
* a formal bridge toward plugin certification.

The Plugin Compliance Framework provides these capabilities.

It transforms plugin governance from an implicit engineering expectation into an explicit, verifiable platform contract.

---

## Final Context Principle

The context of EPIC-PLUGIN-002 can be summarized by one principle:

> Extensibility scales only when conformance can be verified.

FamilyOS therefore treats plugin compliance as a foundational capability required for the long-term integrity, trust, and sustainability of its plugin ecosystem.
