# Plugin Compliance Framework

## 16 Security and Trust Model

### Introduction

The Security and Trust Model defines the trust boundaries required to evaluate FamilyOS plugins safely and reliably.

A compliance system cannot assume that the plugin being evaluated is trustworthy.

The plugin may contain:

* invalid declarations;
* unsupported dependencies;
* unsafe runtime behavior;
* misleading metadata;
* incomplete evidence;
* tampered artifacts;
* intentionally or unintentionally harmful code.

The compliance architecture must therefore separate the subject being evaluated from the mechanisms responsible for evaluating it.

The fundamental trust relationship is:

```text
Plugin
   │
   ▼
Untrusted or Partially Trusted Input
   │
   ▼
Compliance Trust Boundary
   │
   ▼
Validation
   │
   ▼
Trusted Compliance Result
```

---

## Purpose

The Security and Trust Model provides the foundation required to:

* define compliance trust boundaries;
* protect validation infrastructure;
* distinguish trusted and untrusted evidence;
* prevent plugin-controlled policy changes;
* isolate risky validation;
* validate artifact integrity;
* protect compliance results from tampering;
* govern security-critical rules;
* restrict exceptions for critical requirements;
* prepare the ecosystem for third-party plugins.

The compliance framework must itself be trustworthy if it is expected to make trust-relevant decisions about plugins.

---

## Trust Principle

The governing principle is:

> A plugin must never be able to control the mechanisms that determine whether the plugin itself is compliant.

This principle applies to:

* rules;
* profiles;
* severity policy;
* validators;
* evidence trust;
* findings;
* exceptions;
* gates;
* certification eligibility.

A plugin may provide inputs.

It must not control the interpretation of those inputs.

---

## Trust Boundary

The compliance trust boundary separates plugin-controlled state from compliance-controlled state.

Conceptually:

```text
Plugin-Controlled
─────────────────────────────
Source Code
Manifest
Metadata
Configuration
Plugin Tests
Declared Capabilities
Declared Contributions

            │
            ▼

Compliance Trust Boundary

            │
            ▼

Framework-Controlled
─────────────────────────────
Rule Catalog
Profiles
Validators
Evidence Trust Policy
Severity Policy
Compliance Decision
Gate Policy
Certification Eligibility
```

The boundary must remain explicit.

---

## Plugin Trust Levels

Plugins may have different ecosystem trust levels.

Conceptual categories include:

```text
development
experimental
built-in
official
first-party
third-party
```

These classifications may influence execution isolation and evidence requirements.

They must not eliminate fundamental validation.

---

## Origin Does Not Equal Trust

A plugin maintained by the FamilyOS project may have stronger organizational trust than an external plugin.

However:

```text
First-Party Origin
        ≠
Automatic Compliance
```

Built-in and official plugins must still satisfy compliance requirements.

Trust in authorship may influence certification governance.

It must not replace technical evidence.

---

## Untrusted Plugin Inputs

The following plugin-provided inputs must be treated as untrusted or partially trusted until validated:

* manifest fields;
* version declarations;
* ownership metadata;
* dependency declarations;
* capability declarations;
* contribution declarations;
* compatibility declarations;
* test claims;
* generated evidence;
* configuration values.

The compliance framework must verify these inputs before using them as authoritative facts.

---

## Self-Declared Evidence

A plugin may declare:

```text
tests_passed: true
```

or:

```text
compatible_with: FamilyOS 5
```

Such declarations are assertions.

They are not automatically trusted evidence.

The framework must distinguish:

```text
Claim
   │
   ▼
Verification
   │
   ▼
Evidence
```

---

## Compliance Infrastructure Trust

The compliance infrastructure itself forms part of the platform trust base.

Trusted components may include:

* Rule Catalog;
* Profile Registry;
* Validator Registry;
* Validation Engine;
* Evidence Store;
* Decision Engine;
* Gate Policy;
* trusted CI integration.

Compromise of these components can invalidate compliance decisions.

---

## Trusted Computing Base

The minimal set of components required to trust compliance outcomes forms the compliance Trusted Computing Base.

Conceptually:

```text
Rule Definitions
      +
Profile Definitions
      +
Validator Implementations
      +
Decision Policy
      +
Evidence Integrity
      =
Compliance Trust Base
```

The framework should minimize unnecessary components inside this trust base.

---

## Rule Integrity

Compliance rules must be protected from unauthorized modification.

A plugin must not be able to:

* redefine Rule IDs;
* lower rule severity;
* change applicability;
* disable mandatory rules;
* replace remediation with misleading guidance;
* alter exception policy.

Rule definitions belong to governed platform policy.

---

## Profile Integrity

Compliance profiles must also remain protected.

A plugin must not silently change:

```text
official
```

into an effectively weaker profile by modifying local configuration.

Profile composition, mandatory rules, and policy constraints belong to the compliance governance layer.

---

## Validator Integrity

Validators responsible for mandatory or security-sensitive rules must come from trusted sources.

A plugin must not be able to replace:

```text
architecture.import-boundary
```

with its own validator that always returns PASS.

Validator resolution must therefore occur through a governed registry.

---

## Validator Registration

Validator registration must distinguish between:

* framework validators;
* trusted extension validators;
* plugin-local tooling.

Only trusted validator categories should be eligible to produce authoritative evidence for mandatory compliance.

---

## Validator Provenance

Validators should expose provenance information such as:

```text
Validator ID
Validator Version
Provider
Integrity Metadata
```

Stronger profiles may require validators to originate from accepted FamilyOS tooling.

---

## Compliance Engine Integrity

The Compliance Engine must not accept plugin-controlled hooks that can modify:

* effective rule set;
* rule outcomes;
* evidence trust;
* overall status;
* gate decisions.

Extension points must remain constrained to clearly defined interfaces.

---

## Evidence Trust Boundary

Evidence enters the compliance system from multiple sources.

Conceptually:

```text
Plugin Input
Local Tools
CI
Build
Security Scanners
Manual Review
        │
        ▼
Evidence Validation Boundary
        │
        ▼
Accepted Compliance Evidence
```

Every evidence source must be evaluated for provenance, freshness, scope, and integrity.

---

## Evidence Trust Levels

A conceptual trust hierarchy may include:

```text
UNVERIFIED
LOCAL
TRUSTED
ATTESTED
```

These values describe provenance confidence.

They do not describe whether the evidence is positive or negative.

---

## Unverified Evidence

UNVERIFIED evidence may originate from:

* plugin-generated reports;
* manually provided files;
* unknown tooling;
* unsigned external systems.

Such evidence may inform developer workflows.

It should not satisfy high-assurance profiles without independent verification.

---

## Local Evidence

LOCAL evidence is generated through recognized tooling in a developer environment.

Examples include:

* local Pytest;
* local Ruff;
* local MyPy;
* local compliance validators.

Local evidence is useful for rapid feedback.

Release or certification profiles may require stronger provenance.

---

## Trusted Evidence

TRUSTED evidence originates from controlled FamilyOS engineering infrastructure.

Examples may include:

* protected CI;
* controlled build systems;
* approved release workflows;
* recognized security analysis services.

Trusted evidence must preserve enough metadata for later verification.

---

## Attested Evidence

ATTESTED evidence includes a verifiable integrity or producer assertion.

A future model may bind:

```text
Evidence
    +
Artifact Digest
    +
Producer Identity
    +
Cryptographic Attestation
```

Attested evidence may become important for distributed plugin registries and certification.

---

## Evidence Integrity Validation

Evidence must be checked for integrity before use.

Possible mechanisms include:

* hashes;
* content digests;
* signatures;
* provenance records;
* artifact bindings.

A corrupted evidence artifact must result in explicit validation failure.

It must not be silently ignored.

---

## Artifact Integrity

Release-grade and certification-grade compliance should support exact artifact identity.

Conceptually:

```text
Plugin Artifact
      │
      ▼
Artifact Digest
      │
      ▼
Compliance Evidence
      │
      ▼
Compliance Result
```

If the artifact changes, its previous bound evidence may no longer apply.

---

## Artifact Tampering

The framework should detect or reject conditions where:

```text
Validated Artifact Digest
        ≠
Current Artifact Digest
```

This must invalidate artifact-bound assurance.

---

## Compliance Result Integrity

Finalized Compliance Results should be immutable.

Future high-assurance workflows may also support:

* result digests;
* signed results;
* attested evaluations.

A compliance consumer should be able to detect unauthorized result modification.

---

## Report Integrity

Human-readable reports are secondary representations.

Machine-readable structured results should remain the authoritative source.

A modified text report must not override the canonical Compliance Result.

---

## Policy Tampering

Policy tampering represents a critical threat.

Examples include:

* removing a mandatory rule;
* downgrading CRITICAL to INFO;
* disabling a security profile;
* adding an unauthorized exception;
* changing gate acceptance policy.

Policy definitions must therefore be protected through governance and repository controls.

---

## Repository Protection

Where compliance policy is stored in version control, the repository should protect it through mechanisms such as:

* required reviews;
* code ownership;
* protected branches;
* CI validation;
* signed commits or equivalent mechanisms where appropriate.

The exact implementation belongs to engineering governance.

---

## Compliance Policy CI

Changes to compliance policy should pass dedicated validation.

Potential checks include:

```text
Rule schema validation
Profile validation
Gate validation
Duplicate Rule ID checks
Mandatory-rule protection
Rule tests
Impact analysis
```

Invalid policy must not become active.

---

## Mandatory Security Rules

Security-critical requirements may be designated mandatory.

Examples may include:

* prohibition of compliance bypass;
* secret exposure prevention;
* restricted privileged access;
* unauthorized internal API use;
* untrusted code execution boundaries.

Mandatory security rules should normally block all strong profiles.

---

## Non-Exemptible Rules

Some rules may define:

```text
exception_policy = NONE
```

Such rules cannot be waived through ordinary exception mechanisms.

Candidates include requirements protecting:

* authentication;
* authorization;
* artifact integrity;
* compliance engine integrity;
* severe secret exposure;
* critical runtime trust boundaries.

---

## Security Severity

Security findings may use the common severity model:

```text
INFO
WARNING
ERROR
CRITICAL
```

Security domain ownership determines appropriate severity.

The Security domain must not create a separate incompatible severity language.

---

## Critical Compliance Threats

CRITICAL compliance threats may include:

* validator tampering;
* rule catalog tampering;
* evidence forgery;
* authorization bypass;
* arbitrary code execution in trusted compliance infrastructure;
* artifact identity substitution.

Such findings should normally make the plugin:

```text
NON_COMPLIANT
```

and unsuitable for release or certification.

---

## Execution Isolation

Some validation requires executing plugin code.

Plugin execution must be treated according to trust level.

Conceptually:

```text
Static Validation
      │
      ▼
Preferred Where Possible

Runtime Validation Required
      │
      ▼
Isolated Execution Environment
```

Runtime execution should not occur with unnecessary privileges.

---

## Static Validation Preference

Where a requirement can be validated statically, the framework should prefer static inspection over executing untrusted plugin code.

Static validation may cover:

* metadata;
* imports;
* dependencies;
* schemas;
* structure;
* some architecture rules.

This reduces the attack surface of compliance infrastructure.

---

## Runtime Validation

Some requirements require runtime behavior.

Examples include:

* lifecycle activation;
* contract execution;
* service registration;
* failure recovery.

Runtime validation environments should provide appropriate containment.

---

## Runtime Sandbox

Future third-party validation may require sandboxing controls such as:

* filesystem isolation;
* process restrictions;
* memory limits;
* CPU limits;
* network restrictions;
* credential isolation;
* timeout enforcement.

The specific sandbox mechanism belongs to implementation and infrastructure design.

---

## Credential Isolation

Validation environments should not expose unnecessary platform credentials to plugins.

A plugin being tested for compliance must not gain access to:

* deployment secrets;
* production credentials;
* signing keys;
* certification keys;
* unrelated CI credentials.

Credential scope should follow least privilege.

---

## Network Isolation

Third-party or untrusted plugin validation may require restricted network access.

Network access should be enabled only when required by the validation scenario.

External communication itself may also be subject to compliance rules.

---

## Filesystem Isolation

Runtime validation should prevent plugins from accessing unrelated host data.

Test fixtures and required plugin resources should be provided explicitly.

Unrestricted filesystem access creates unnecessary validation risk.

---

## Resource Exhaustion

Plugins may accidentally or intentionally consume excessive resources.

Validation infrastructure should protect against:

* infinite loops;
* memory exhaustion;
* process spawning;
* disk exhaustion;
* excessive network activity.

Timeouts and resource controls are part of safe execution.

---

## Validator Timeouts

Every validator that may block indefinitely should support controlled timeout behavior.

A timeout must remain distinct from plugin non-compliance unless the rule explicitly concerns timeout behavior.

---

## Third-Party Plugin Validation

Third-party plugins represent the strongest trust-boundary case.

The target model is:

```text
Third-Party Plugin
        │
        ▼
Untrusted Input Boundary
        │
        ▼
Static Validation
        │
        ▼
Isolated Runtime Validation
        │
        ▼
Trusted Evidence
        │
        ▼
Compliance Result
```

This model enables extensibility without granting external code implicit trust.

---

## Built-In Plugin Validation

Built-in plugins may execute within more trusted engineering environments.

However, built-in status does not permit:

* bypassing rules;
* using unsigned self-evidence as certification proof;
* changing policy;
* skipping mandatory security validation.

The difference is operational trust, not compliance semantics.

---

## Official Plugin Validation

Official plugins should provide a high-assurance baseline for the ecosystem.

They should demonstrate that FamilyOS applies the same compliance principles to its own plugins that it expects future third-party authors to follow.

---

## Plugin-Supplied Validators

Plugins may potentially provide test helpers or domain-specific diagnostic tooling.

Such tooling must not automatically become authoritative compliance validation.

A plugin-supplied validator may produce:

```text
UNVERIFIED or LOCAL evidence
```

until the framework explicitly recognizes and governs it.

---

## Trusted Validator Extensions

The framework may eventually support trusted validator extensions.

A validator extension should require:

* explicit registration;
* ownership;
* review;
* stable validator identity;
* tests;
* trust classification;
* compatible evidence schema.

Validator extensibility must not weaken the compliance trust boundary.

---

## Compliance Bypass Detection

The Security domain should consider explicit compliance bypass attempts.

Examples include:

* modifying rule files during validation;
* intercepting validator resolution;
* falsifying evidence metadata;
* altering compliance output;
* bypassing mandatory execution.

Detected tampering should produce strong security findings.

---

## Rule Catalog Tampering

If rule integrity cannot be established, the framework must not issue a trustworthy compliance decision.

The result should be:

```text
ERROR
```

rather than attempting validation under unknown policy.

---

## Profile Tampering

If the requested or resolved profile has been modified outside accepted governance, evaluation must fail.

The system must not proceed under a potentially weakened profile.

---

## Evidence Forgery

Evidence claiming trusted provenance without valid proof must be rejected.

For example:

```text
trust = TRUSTED
```

inside a plugin-controlled file is not sufficient to make evidence trusted.

Trust is derived from the evidence source and verification process.

---

## Manual Review Trust

Manual evidence requires trusted reviewer identity and authority.

A plugin author should not be able to self-approve a security exception requiring independent governance review.

Review authority must be validated separately from ordinary plugin ownership.

---

## Separation of Duties

High-assurance workflows may require separation between:

* plugin author;
* validator owner;
* exception approver;
* release approver;
* certification authority.

The exact separation policy depends on lifecycle and risk.

The architecture must support these distinctions.

---

## Conflict of Interest

Governance should prevent one actor from unilaterally controlling all stages when independent assurance is required.

For example:

```text
Plugin Author
    ≠
Security Exception Authority
```

for security-critical cases.

---

## Exception Security

Exceptions represent intentional policy deviations.

They therefore belong to the trust boundary.

Exception validation must include:

* authority;
* scope;
* expiration;
* rule eligibility;
* profile eligibility;
* artifact or plugin association.

Forged or invalid exceptions must not affect compliance.

---

## Suppression Security

Suppressions must not become a covert mechanism for hiding critical findings.

Policies should restrict suppression of:

* CRITICAL findings;
* mandatory rule findings;
* security-sensitive failures.

Suppressed findings remain visible in structured results.

---

## Gate Security

Gate policy must be protected from plugin-controlled configuration.

A plugin should not be able to modify:

```text
Release Gate accepts NON_COMPLIANT
```

through its own repository metadata.

Gate acceptance semantics belong to trusted governance.

---

## Release Trust

Release-grade compliance should rely on trusted evidence associated with the release candidate.

Conceptually:

```text
Trusted Source Revision
        │
        ▼
Trusted Build
        │
        ▼
Artifact Digest
        │
        ▼
Release Compliance
```

This chain should remain auditable.

---

## Certification Trust

Certification-grade assurance requires the strongest trust model.

Potential requirements include:

* exact artifact binding;
* trusted or attested evidence;
* approved framework version;
* protected compliance execution;
* restricted exceptions;
* independent governance approval.

Certification must not rely on unverified plugin-controlled claims.

---

## Trust Escalation

Evidence requirements may strengthen through the lifecycle.

Conceptually:

```text
Development
  LOCAL

CI
  TRUSTED

Release
  TRUSTED + Artifact Bound

Certification
  TRUSTED / ATTESTED + Governance Verified
```

The exact trust hierarchy must be governed.

---

## Trust Downgrade

A stronger evidence source may become untrusted if:

* integrity validation fails;
* provenance cannot be verified;
* producer is compromised;
* artifact association is incorrect;
* evidence is modified.

Trust is contextual and must be re-evaluated where necessary.

---

## Compromised Producer

If an evidence producer becomes compromised, evidence previously generated by that producer may require review or revalidation.

The framework should support invalidating evidence by producer identity or version.

---

## Revocation of Trust

Future systems may maintain trust registries capable of marking:

* validator versions;
* CI producers;
* build systems;
* signing identities;

as no longer trusted.

This can trigger compliance revalidation.

---

## Supply Chain Security

Plugin compliance intersects with software supply chain security.

Relevant concerns include:

* dependency provenance;
* artifact integrity;
* build reproducibility;
* trusted builders;
* package substitution;
* dependency confusion.

The compliance framework may consume evidence from future supply-chain security systems.

---

## Dependency Trust

Dependency compliance should evaluate more than declaration correctness where stronger profiles require it.

Future evidence may include:

* package integrity;
* approved source;
* vulnerability status;
* license status;
* provenance.

Dependency trust requirements belong to relevant FamilyOS security and governance policies.

---

## Plugin Package Integrity

Packaged plugins should support validation that:

* expected files are present;
* unexpected prohibited files are absent;
* metadata matches the package;
* package digest is stable;
* artifact identity matches the compliance result.

This creates a reliable distribution boundary.

---

## Secure Defaults

Compliance infrastructure should fail safely.

When trust cannot be established:

```text
Unknown
```

must not become:

```text
Trusted
```

and:

```text
Not Evaluated
```

must not become:

```text
PASS
```

Conservative semantics protect the integrity of the framework.

---

## Fail-Closed Policy

Strong lifecycle gates should generally fail closed when required trust cannot be established.

For example:

```text
Evidence Integrity Unknown
        │
        ▼
Release Gate BLOCK
```

This does not mean every local development workflow must stop.

Gate policy defines the assurance level required.

---

## Availability vs Integrity

Compliance infrastructure must distinguish availability failures from integrity failures.

For example:

```text
Remote evidence service unavailable
```

is different from:

```text
Evidence signature invalid
```

The first may produce `INCOMPLETE` or `ERROR`.

The second represents a stronger trust failure and may require security escalation.

---

## Audit Logging

Security-sensitive compliance operations should support audit logging.

Events may include:

* policy changes;
* rule activation;
* exception approval;
* trusted validator registration;
* evidence trust changes;
* gate overrides;
* certification package generation.

Audit logs are operational governance records.

---

## Security Diagnostics

Security-related diagnostics should provide enough detail to remediate issues without unnecessarily exposing sensitive information.

Diagnostic output must avoid leaking:

* secrets;
* private keys;
* tokens;
* sensitive environment values.

---

## Secret Redaction

If a validator detects a secret, evidence should record:

```text
Secret detected
Location identified
Rule violated
```

but not copy the secret value into:

* findings;
* reports;
* evidence packages;
* CI annotations.

---

## Data Minimization

Compliance should collect only the information required to establish a rule outcome.

Excessive evidence collection increases:

* privacy risk;
* storage cost;
* security exposure;
* audit complexity.

Evidence collection should therefore follow least-data principles.

---

## Sensitive Evidence

Some evidence may require restricted visibility.

Examples include:

* security scanner details;
* vulnerability traces;
* internal architecture paths;
* restricted configuration metadata.

Structured evidence should support access-controlled storage where necessary.

---

## Public Compliance Metadata

Future public plugin registries should expose only safe compliance metadata.

Examples may include:

```text
Compliance Status
Framework Version
Profile
Certification Status
Evaluation Date
Artifact Digest
```

Sensitive finding detail should remain internal when appropriate.

---

## Security Incident Response

A compliance-related security incident may require:

* disabling a validator;
* revoking trusted evidence;
* revalidating plugins;
* blocking releases;
* suspending certification;
* introducing emergency rules.

The framework architecture should support these responses without rewriting historical results.

---

## Emergency Security Rules

Critical vulnerabilities may require rapid activation of a new compliance rule.

Emergency activation must still preserve:

* Rule ID;
* owner;
* rationale;
* severity;
* activation date;
* review trail.

Urgency does not eliminate governance.

---

## Revalidation After Security Changes

Security changes may trigger ecosystem-wide compliance revalidation.

Examples include:

```text
New Prohibited Dependency
       │
       ▼
Affected Plugin Detection
       │
       ▼
Revalidation
```

or:

```text
Compromised Validator
       │
       ▼
Invalidate Evidence
       │
       ▼
Revalidation
```

---

## Trust Drift

Trust can change even when plugin code does not.

Examples include:

* producer compromise;
* expired attestation;
* revoked signing key;
* dependency vulnerability;
* changed security policy.

The framework should treat trust drift as a valid revalidation trigger.

---

## Security Testing

The Security and Trust Model requires dedicated tests.

Core test categories include:

* untrusted evidence rejection;
* trusted evidence acceptance;
* forged trust metadata;
* rule catalog tampering;
* profile tampering;
* unauthorized validator replacement;
* exception authority validation;
* suppression restrictions;
* artifact digest mismatch;
* validator timeout;
* runtime isolation behavior;
* secret redaction;
* evidence integrity failure.

---

## Adversarial Testing

High-assurance compliance infrastructure should include adversarial tests.

Examples include attempts to:

* bypass mandatory rules;
* inject false evidence;
* manipulate profile resolution;
* alter result serialization;
* exploit validator execution;
* escape runtime isolation.

Compliance tooling should assume that future third-party plugins may be actively hostile.

---

## Trust Model Maturity

The trust architecture may mature through stages:

```text
Local Validation
      │
      ▼
Trusted CI
      │
      ▼
Artifact Binding
      │
      ▼
Attested Evidence
      │
      ▼
Distributed Certification Trust
```

The initial implementation does not need every stage immediately.

The architecture must leave room for them.

---

## Initial Security Baseline

The initial implementation should prioritize:

1. protected Rule Catalog;
2. protected Profile Registry;
3. trusted Validator Registry;
4. explicit evidence trust levels;
5. source revision correlation;
6. artifact digest support;
7. secret redaction;
8. mandatory security rule enforcement;
9. exception authority validation;
10. runtime timeout and isolation strategy.

This creates a strong foundation before third-party plugin distribution expands.

---

## Future Trust Capabilities

Future evolution may include:

* signed rule bundles;
* signed compliance results;
* validator attestations;
* trusted builder integration;
* SBOM integration;
* provenance standards;
* remote trust registries;
* certificate transparency;
* distributed plugin verification.

These capabilities should strengthen the existing model without changing its fundamental trust boundaries.

---

## Security Anti-Patterns

The framework must avoid several trust anti-patterns.

### Plugin Self-Trust

Do not accept plugin claims as authoritative evidence without validation.

### Validator Self-Registration

Do not let a plugin replace validators governing its own mandatory compliance.

### Mutable Policy

Do not permit runtime mutation of active compliance rules by evaluated plugins.

### Secret Exposure

Do not store sensitive secret values in findings or reports.

### Unisolated Untrusted Execution

Do not execute third-party plugin code with unnecessary host privileges.

### Trust by Origin

Do not treat first-party ownership as proof of compliance.

### Silent Trust Downgrade

Do not accept weaker evidence when a stronger profile requires trusted provenance.

### Integrity Failure as Warning

Do not downgrade artifact or evidence integrity failures into ordinary advisory findings.

---

## Security Invariants

The Security and Trust Model establishes the following invariants:

1. The evaluated plugin is not automatically trusted.
2. Plugins cannot define their own compliance policy.
3. Plugins cannot alter mandatory rule semantics.
4. Rule and profile registries belong to the trusted compliance boundary.
5. Authoritative validators are governed.
6. Evidence trust is derived, not self-declared.
7. Evidence provenance must remain traceable.
8. Artifact-bound compliance requires artifact identity validation.
9. Integrity failures never silently become PASS.
10. Strong profiles may require trusted or attested evidence.
11. Plugin origin does not eliminate validation.
12. Runtime validation of untrusted plugins should be isolated.
13. Compliance infrastructure follows least privilege.
14. Secrets are never copied into ordinary evidence payloads.
15. Critical security rules may prohibit exceptions.
16. Suppressions cannot silently hide critical findings.
17. Gate policy cannot be weakened by plugin-local configuration.
18. Finalized Compliance Results are immutable.
19. Trust changes may trigger revalidation.
20. Certification requires stronger trust guarantees than ordinary local development.

---

## Reference Trust Model

The complete reference model is:

```text
Plugin / Artifact
       │
       ▼
Untrusted Input Boundary
       │
       ▼
Static Validation
       │
       ▼
Controlled Runtime Validation
       │
       ▼
Evidence Collection
       │
       ▼
Provenance Validation
       │
       ▼
Integrity Validation
       │
       ▼
Trust Evaluation
       │
       ▼
Compliance Rule Evaluation
       │
       ▼
Compliance Result
       │
       ▼
Lifecycle Gate
       │
       ▼
Release / Certification
```

Each boundary progressively strengthens assurance.

---

## Security Summary

The FamilyOS compliance trust model protects both the platform and the integrity of compliance decisions.

The model can be summarized as:

```text
Untrusted Plugin
      +
Trusted Policy
      +
Trusted Validators
      +
Verified Evidence
      +
Controlled Execution
      =
Trustworthy Compliance Decision
```

A compliance system that cannot protect its own trust boundaries cannot reliably evaluate the trustworthiness of plugins.

---

## Final Security Principle

The governing principle of the Security and Trust Model is:

> Trust must be established by controlled verification, never granted merely because a plugin claims, appears, or is expected to be trustworthy.

This principle allows FamilyOS to validate built-in, official, and future third-party plugins through one consistent model while protecting the integrity of the platform, its engineering workflows, and its certification ecosystem.
