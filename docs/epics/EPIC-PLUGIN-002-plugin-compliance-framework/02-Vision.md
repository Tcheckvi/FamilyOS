# Plugin Compliance Framework

## 02 Vision

### Introduction

The vision of the FamilyOS Plugin Compliance Framework is to make plugin conformance explicit, measurable, reproducible, and enforceable across the entire plugin ecosystem.

Compliance must become a native engineering capability of the platform rather than a collection of manual reviews or undocumented expectations.

Every plugin should be able to answer a fundamental question:

> Can this plugin demonstrate that it conforms to the FamilyOS platform contract?

The long-term objective is to make that answer deterministic, evidence-based, and independently verifiable.

---

## Vision Statement

The Plugin Compliance Framework establishes a future in which every FamilyOS plugin can be evaluated automatically against a versioned set of platform requirements.

The target model is:

```text
Plugin
   │
   ▼
Compliance Rules
   │
   ▼
Validation Engine
   │
   ▼
Compliance Evidence
   │
   ▼
Compliance Decision
   │
   ▼
Certification Readiness
```

This model transforms compliance from an informal engineering judgment into a governed platform capability.

---

## Strategic Vision

FamilyOS must support ecosystem growth without sacrificing platform integrity.

The strategic vision is therefore based on four complementary objectives:

* preserve architectural integrity;
* enable safe extensibility;
* automate deterministic validation;
* establish verifiable trust.

These objectives must remain balanced.

Excessive restriction would limit extensibility.

Insufficient governance would weaken platform integrity.

The compliance framework provides the mechanism for maintaining this balance.

---

## Compliance as Code

The long-term model for FamilyOS plugin compliance is Compliance as Code.

Compliance requirements that can be evaluated deterministically should be represented as executable or machine-interpretable rules.

Instead of relying exclusively on documentation such as:

```text
Plugins should declare a valid identifier.
```

the platform should be capable of expressing and evaluating the corresponding requirement through a formal compliance rule.

Conceptually:

```text
Requirement
    │
    ▼
Compliance Rule
    │
    ▼
Automated Evaluation
    │
    ▼
Evidence
    │
    ▼
Finding or Pass
```

This enables compliance requirements to participate directly in engineering workflows.

---

## Declarative Compliance Model

Compliance rules should be declarative wherever practical.

A rule describes what must be true without requiring plugin authors to understand the internal implementation of the compliance engine.

A conceptual rule may contain:

```text
Rule ID
Domain
Description
Requirement
Severity
Applicability
Validation Strategy
Evidence Requirements
Remediation
Framework Version
```

This separation allows the compliance engine and compliance policy to evolve independently.

---

## Versioned Rule Catalog

FamilyOS should maintain an authoritative catalog of plugin compliance rules.

Every rule must have a stable identity.

Example conceptual identifiers may follow a structure such as:

```text
PLUGIN-META-001
PLUGIN-ARCH-001
PLUGIN-CAP-001
PLUGIN-CONTRIB-001
PLUGIN-DEP-001
PLUGIN-SEC-001
PLUGIN-TEST-001
PLUGIN-QLT-001
PLUGIN-DOC-001
PLUGIN-LIFE-001
```

The exact naming model is defined by the detailed compliance specification.

Stable rule identifiers enable:

* traceability;
* reporting;
* suppression governance;
* remediation documentation;
* historical comparison;
* automation;
* compatibility analysis.

---

## Compliance Domains

The vision is to organize rules into explicit compliance domains.

The primary domains include:

```text
Identity
Metadata
Structure
Architecture
Capabilities
Contributions
Dependencies
Configuration
Security
Testing
Quality
Documentation
Compatibility
Lifecycle
Governance
```

Each domain owns a specific dimension of plugin conformance.

A plugin compliance decision is derived from the combined evaluation of applicable domains.

---

## Validation Engine

The framework should provide a dedicated validation engine capable of evaluating plugins against the active compliance rule set.

Conceptually:

```text
                    ┌──────────────────────┐
                    │ Compliance Rule Set  │
                    └──────────┬───────────┘
                               │
                               ▼
Plugin ───────────────► Compliance Engine
                               │
                    ┌──────────┼───────────┐
                    ▼          ▼           ▼
                 Passes     Findings    Evidence
                    │          │           │
                    └──────────┼───────────┘
                               ▼
                      Compliance Result
```

The engine must remain independent from individual plugin implementations.

Plugins are evaluated by the framework.

They must not define the rules by which their own compliance is determined.

---

## Deterministic Validation

Determinism is a core property of the target architecture.

Given the same:

```text
Plugin Version
Platform Version
Compliance Framework Version
Configuration
```

the compliance engine should produce the same result whenever environmental inputs remain equivalent.

Deterministic validation enables:

* reproducibility;
* debugging;
* CI reliability;
* certification evidence;
* auditability;
* historical verification.

Rules that inherently require human judgment must be identified explicitly rather than presented as deterministic automated checks.

---

## Evidence-Based Compliance

Every meaningful compliance decision should be supported by evidence.

Evidence may originate from:

* plugin metadata;
* manifests;
* source structure;
* dependency graphs;
* static analysis;
* type checking;
* test execution;
* quality tools;
* security validation;
* documentation validation;
* runtime contract tests;
* compatibility checks.

The conceptual model is:

```text
Requirement
    │
    ▼
Validation
    │
    ▼
Evidence
    │
    ▼
Decision
```

Compliance decisions without traceable evidence should be avoided.

---

## Evidence Model

The framework should establish a normalized evidence model.

Evidence should identify:

* evidence type;
* source;
* rule association;
* plugin association;
* validation timestamp;
* validation mechanism;
* result;
* relevant metadata.

This enables compliance reports to explain not only the final status but also why that status was produced.

---

## Compliance Findings

Failed or partially satisfied rules should generate structured findings.

A finding should contain sufficient information for a developer to understand and remediate the problem.

The target model includes:

```text
Finding ID
Rule ID
Domain
Severity
Message
Evidence
Location
Remediation
Status
```

Findings should be stable enough to support automation and sufficiently descriptive for human users.

---

## Severity Model

Not every compliance finding has the same impact.

The framework should define a consistent severity model.

A conceptual model may include:

```text
INFO
WARNING
ERROR
CRITICAL
```

Severity determines how findings affect:

* compliance status;
* engineering gates;
* release eligibility;
* certification readiness.

The exact severity semantics must be formally governed.

---

## Progressive Compliance

Compliance should support progressive maturity rather than only a binary pass-or-fail model.

Different plugin classifications and lifecycle stages may require different levels of validation.

A conceptual progression is:

```text
Detected
   │
   ▼
Structurally Valid
   │
   ▼
Contract Valid
   │
   ▼
Compliant
   │
   ▼
Certification Eligible
```

This allows developers to receive useful compliance feedback before a plugin reaches production maturity.

---

## Plugin Classification Profiles

Compliance requirements should be evaluated through classification-aware profiles.

For example:

```text
Development Plugin
        │
        ▼
Development Compliance Profile

Official Plugin
        │
        ▼
Official Compliance Profile

Third-Party Plugin
        │
        ▼
External Compliance Profile
```

Profiles define which rules apply and which severity thresholds are required.

The underlying rules remain centrally governed.

---

## Compliance Profiles

A compliance profile represents a defined set of requirements for a specific plugin context.

Profiles may vary according to:

* plugin classification;
* lifecycle stage;
* release channel;
* trust level;
* platform environment;
* certification target.

Profiles should compose existing rules rather than duplicate them.

This allows FamilyOS to maintain one authoritative rule catalog while supporting multiple validation contexts.

---

## Developer Experience Vision

Compliance must improve developer experience rather than merely introduce additional gates.

Plugin authors should be able to validate compliance locally before CI or certification.

The intended interaction is:

```text
Developer
    │
    ▼
Implement Plugin
    │
    ▼
Run Compliance Check
    │
    ├── PASS ─────► Continue
    │
    └── FAIL
         │
         ▼
      Findings
         │
         ▼
     Remediation
         │
         ▼
     Revalidate
```

Fast feedback is essential.

Developers should not need to wait until release preparation to discover fundamental compliance violations.

---

## CLI Vision

The FamilyOS CLI should eventually expose plugin compliance operations.

Conceptual commands may include:

```text
familyos plugin compliance check
familyos plugin compliance report
familyos plugin compliance rules
familyos plugin compliance explain
```

The final command model belongs to the implementation specification and CLI architecture.

The framework vision requires only that compliance capabilities be accessible through standard FamilyOS engineering interfaces.

---

## CI Integration Vision

Compliance validation should become a first-class CI capability.

A typical pipeline may evolve toward:

```text
Source
  │
  ▼
Static Analysis
  │
  ▼
Type Checking
  │
  ▼
Tests
  │
  ▼
Quality Gates
  │
  ▼
Plugin Compliance
  │
  ▼
Build
  │
  ▼
Release Candidate
```

Compliance should reuse existing evidence where possible instead of unnecessarily executing duplicate validation.

---

## Build and Release Integration

Compliance must participate in build and release decisions.

A release process should be capable of requiring a defined compliance profile before producing or publishing an eligible plugin artifact.

Conceptually:

```text
Plugin Source
     │
     ▼
Engineering Validation
     │
     ▼
Compliance Gate
     │
     ├── FAIL ───► Block
     │
     └── PASS
          │
          ▼
        Build
          │
          ▼
        Release
```

The required profile may vary according to release type and plugin classification.

---

## Certification Readiness

The compliance framework should produce evidence that can be consumed by a separate certification process.

Certification must not need to rediscover deterministic compliance information manually.

Instead:

```text
Compliance Engine
       │
       ▼
Compliance Report
       │
       ▼
Certification Evidence
       │
       ▼
Certification Process
```

This establishes a clean boundary between technical conformance and ecosystem approval.

---

## Continuous Revalidation

Compliance is contextual and can change over time.

The framework vision therefore includes revalidation.

Revalidation may be triggered by:

* plugin changes;
* platform changes;
* compliance rule changes;
* dependency changes;
* security policy changes;
* release preparation;
* certification renewal.

This prevents compliance from becoming a one-time historical assertion.

---

## Compliance Drift Detection

A previously compliant plugin may drift out of compliance without direct source changes.

For example, a dependency may become prohibited or a platform contract may be deprecated.

The framework should eventually support detection of compliance drift.

Conceptually:

```text
Previously Compliant Plugin
            │
            ▼
Environment or Rule Change
            │
            ▼
Revalidation
            │
       ┌────┴────┐
       ▼         ▼
    Stable      Drift
                  │
                  ▼
               Finding
```

This capability becomes increasingly important as the ecosystem grows.

---

## Machine-Readable Reporting

Compliance results must be suitable for automated consumers.

The framework should support structured output that can be consumed by:

* CLI tools;
* CI systems;
* build systems;
* release systems;
* certification services;
* dashboards;
* future ecosystem registries.

Human-readable reports remain important, but they should be projections of structured compliance data rather than the only representation.

---

## Human-Readable Reporting

Developers and reviewers require clear explanations.

A human-readable report should answer:

* what was validated;
* which profile was used;
* which rules passed;
* which rules failed;
* why they failed;
* how severe the failures are;
* how to remediate them;
* whether the plugin is compliant;
* whether the plugin is certification eligible.

The framework must serve both machines and humans.

---

## Auditability

Compliance decisions must be traceable.

A future compliance result should make it possible to determine:

```text
What was evaluated?
Which rules were used?
Which framework version was active?
Which evidence was collected?
Which findings were produced?
Why was the final status assigned?
```

This traceability is required for trustworthy certification and long-term ecosystem governance.

---

## Extensibility of the Framework

The compliance framework itself must be extensible.

New platform capabilities will introduce new compliance requirements.

The framework must therefore support:

* new rule domains;
* new validation mechanisms;
* new evidence providers;
* new compliance profiles;
* new reporting formats;
* new lifecycle policies.

Framework extensibility must remain governed to prevent fragmented compliance behavior.

---

## Separation of Policy and Mechanism

The architecture should separate compliance policy from compliance execution.

Conceptually:

```text
Compliance Policy
      │
      │ defines
      ▼
Compliance Rules
      │
      │ evaluated by
      ▼
Compliance Engine
      │
      │ produces
      ▼
Compliance Results
```

This separation allows requirements to evolve without unnecessarily coupling them to validation infrastructure.

---

## Single Source of Compliance Truth

FamilyOS should maintain one authoritative interpretation of plugin compliance.

Different tools must not independently invent incompatible definitions of compliance.

CLI validation, CI validation, release validation, and certification validation should consume the same governed rule model.

The target is:

```text
                Compliance Rule Catalog
                         │
          ┌──────────────┼──────────────┐
          ▼              ▼              ▼
         CLI             CI          Release
          │              │              │
          └──────────────┼──────────────┘
                         ▼
                Consistent Results
```

This prevents compliance fragmentation.

---

## Architecture Vision

The long-term conceptual architecture is:

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│             Compliance Policy               │
│                                             │
│  Rules · Profiles · Severity · Governance   │
└──────────────────────┬──────────────────────┘
                       │
                       ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│             Compliance Engine               │
│                                             │
│ Discovery · Validation · Evidence · Results │
└──────────────────────┬──────────────────────┘
                       │
                       ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│            Compliance Reporting             │
│                                             │
│ Findings · Reports · Status · Explanation   │
└──────────────────────┬──────────────────────┘
                       │
             ┌─────────┼─────────┐
             ▼         ▼         ▼
            CLI        CI    Certification
```

This architecture keeps policy, execution, reporting, and consumers clearly separated.

---

## Target Ecosystem State

The mature FamilyOS plugin ecosystem should provide predictable answers to the following questions:

```text
Can the plugin be discovered?
Can the plugin be loaded?
Does the plugin satisfy its contracts?
Does the plugin satisfy engineering requirements?
Is the plugin compliant?
Is the plugin eligible for certification?
Is the plugin certified?
```

Each question represents a distinct level of assurance.

The Plugin Compliance Framework owns the transition from contract validation to demonstrated platform conformance.

---

## Long-Term Outcome

The long-term outcome of EPIC-PLUGIN-002 is not merely a compliance command or a collection of validators.

It is an ecosystem capability.

FamilyOS should eventually be able to evaluate any supported plugin through a consistent process and produce a traceable answer describing its conformance state.

This capability provides the foundation required for:

* trusted official plugins;
* scalable third-party extensibility;
* automated ecosystem governance;
* reliable certification;
* safer platform evolution.

---

## Vision Summary

The Plugin Compliance Framework establishes a future where plugin compliance is:

* defined through governed rules;
* evaluated through deterministic mechanisms;
* supported by explicit evidence;
* expressed through structured findings;
* adaptable through compliance profiles;
* accessible during development;
* integrated into CI;
* enforceable during build and release;
* reusable during certification;
* revalidated throughout the plugin lifecycle;
* auditable over time.

The framework transforms compliance into a first-class FamilyOS engineering capability.

---

## Final Vision Principle

The long-term vision of EPIC-PLUGIN-002 is summarized by one principle:

> Every claim of plugin compliance must be backed by rules, evidence, and reproducible validation.

This principle establishes the foundation for a plugin ecosystem that can grow without sacrificing architectural integrity, engineering quality, or trust.
