# Plugin Compliance Framework

## 18 Roadmap

### Introduction

The Plugin Compliance Framework Roadmap defines how FamilyOS should progress from architectural definition to a production-grade plugin compliance capability.

The roadmap is intentionally incremental.

The framework should not attempt to implement every advanced capability at once.

The preferred strategy is to establish a minimal but trustworthy compliance core, validate it against official plugins, integrate it into engineering workflows, and then progressively strengthen enforcement, evidence trust, release integration, certification readiness, and third-party support.

The target progression is:

        ▼
Continuous Compliance
```

---

## Roadmap Principle

The governing roadmap principle is:

> Build the smallest trustworthy compliance system first, then increase assurance without changing its fundamental semantics.

The implementation may grow substantially.

The meanings of rules, evidence, findings, compliance results, and lifecycle decisions must remain stable and governed.

---

## Strategic Objectives

The roadmap is organized around several strategic objectives:

* establish one authoritative plugin compliance model;
* make compliance executable rather than purely documentary;
* validate official plugins consistently;
* integrate compliance into normal engineering workflows;
* reuse existing FamilyOS engineering evidence;
* enforce compliance progressively;
* strengthen evidence and artifact trust;
* prepare certification integration;
* prepare safe third-party validation;
* support continuous ecosystem compliance.

Each phase should produce independently useful capability.

---

## Phase 0 — Framework Definition

### Objective

Complete the normative architecture and governance foundation of EPIC-PLUGIN-002.

This phase defines the contracts implementation must follow.

### Deliverables

Phase 0 establishes:

* compliance architecture;
* compliance domains;
* rule model;
* profile model;
* Validation Engine architecture;
* Evidence Model;
* Findings and Severity Model;
* reporting architecture;
* automation model;
* compliance gates;
* certification integration;
* governance;
* security and trust model;
* framework lifecycle;
* implementation roadmap;
* validation model;
* release model.

### Exit Criteria

Phase 0 is complete when:

* terminology is stable;
* semantic boundaries are explicit;
* architecture is internally coherent;
* implementation responsibilities are clear;
* validation expectations are documented;
* governance expectations are documented;
* implementation can begin without inventing foundational compliance semantics.

---

## Phase 1 — Core Compliance Models

### Objective

Implement the foundational domain models required by all subsequent compliance capabilities.

### Initial Models

The first implementation should introduce concepts equivalent to:

```text
ComplianceRule
ComplianceProfile
ValidationContext
ValidationRequest
Evidence
RuleOutcome
ComplianceFinding
ComplianceResult
```

The physical Python package structure may evolve.

The semantic boundaries must remain aligned with the framework.

### Initial Enumerations

The initial implementation should support canonical rule outcomes:

```text
PASS
FAIL
NOT_APPLICABLE
NOT_EVALUATED
ERROR
```

and canonical compliance statuses:

```text
COMPLIANT
NON_COMPLIANT
INCOMPLETE
ERROR
```

### Exit Criteria

Phase 1 is complete when the core models:

* are implemented;
* have stable interfaces;
* are typed;
* are serializable where required;
* have unit tests;
* preserve documented semantic distinctions.

---

## Phase 2 — Rule Registry

### Objective

Create the authoritative executable representation of plugin compliance rules.

### Rule Registry Responsibilities

The Rule Registry should support:

* Rule ID uniqueness;
* rule lookup;
* domain classification;
* lifecycle state;
* severity;
* applicability;
* validator binding;
* evidence requirements;
* dependencies;
* remediation metadata;
* ownership.

### Initial Rule Families

The initial catalog should prioritize high-value deterministic rules.

Recommended families include:

```text
PLUGIN-ID
PLUGIN-META
PLUGIN-STRUCT
PLUGIN-ARCH
PLUGIN-CAP
PLUGIN-CONTRIB
PLUGIN-DEP
PLUGIN-TEST
PLUGIN-QLT
PLUGIN-DOC
PLUGIN-SEC
```

### Rule Volume

The first implementation should remain intentionally small.

A useful initial target is:

```text
10–20 deterministic rules
```

The objective is to validate architecture and developer experience rather than maximize rule count.

### Exit Criteria

Phase 2 is complete when:

* Rule IDs are stable;
* registry validation works;
* duplicate rules are rejected;
* rule metadata is machine-readable;
* representative rules have PASS and FAIL tests;
* rule semantics are explainable.

---

## Phase 3 — Profile Registry

### Objective

Implement compliance profile composition.

### Initial Profile

The first operational profile should target official FamilyOS plugins.

Conceptually:

```text
official-v1
```

It should provide the baseline from which stronger future profiles can evolve.

### Future Profiles

The architecture should support:

```text
development
experimental
built-in
official
third-party
release
certification
```

Not every profile must be implemented immediately.

### Profile Resolver

The implementation should resolve profiles deterministically from:

* explicit requests;
* plugin classification;
* lifecycle context.

### Exit Criteria

Phase 3 is complete when:

* profile definitions are machine-readable;
* rule composition is deterministic;
* mandatory rules cannot be silently removed;
* inheritance is validated;
* invalid profiles fail explicitly.

---

## Phase 4 — Validator Registry

### Objective

Create the controlled mapping between compliance requirements and validation implementations.

### Initial Validator Families

Initial validators may include:

```text
ManifestValidator
StructureValidator
ImportBoundaryValidator
CapabilityValidator
ContributionValidator
DependencyValidator
DocumentationValidator
TestEvidenceValidator
QualityEvidenceValidator
```

### Validator Contract

All validators should conform to one stable contract.

Conceptually:

```text
ValidationContext
        +
Validator Input
        │
        ▼
Validator
        │
        ▼
Validator Result
```

Validators must not declare overall compliance.

### Exit Criteria

Phase 4 is complete when:

* validator discovery is governed;
* validator IDs are stable;
* validator versions are available;
* validator failures remain distinct from compliance failures;
* validators have contract tests.

---

## Phase 5 — Validation Engine

### Objective

Implement the orchestration core of plugin compliance.

### Required Capabilities

The initial Validation Engine should support:

* request validation;
* Validation Context construction;
* profile resolution;
* effective rule-set resolution;
* applicability evaluation;
* rule dependency ordering;
* validator resolution;
* validator execution;
* evidence collection;
* rule evaluation;
* finding generation;
* final status derivation.

### Reference Flow

```text
Validation Request
       │
       ▼
Validation Context
       │
       ▼
Profile Resolution
       │
       ▼
Effective Rule Set
       │
       ▼
Validation Plan
       │
       ▼
Validators
       │
       ▼
Evidence
       │
       ▼
Rule Outcomes
       │
       ▼
Findings
       │
       ▼
Compliance Result
```

### Exit Criteria

Phase 5 is complete when a plugin can be evaluated locally and produce a deterministic structured Compliance Result.

---

## Phase 6 — Initial Rule Catalog

### Objective

Create the first practically useful plugin compliance baseline.

Rules should be selected according to:

* architectural importance;
* determinism;
* validation reliability;
* remediation clarity;
* current FamilyOS contracts.

---

## Identity Baseline

Initial identity rules may verify:

* Plugin ID exists;
* Plugin ID follows naming requirements;
* plugin version is valid;
* plugin classification is valid.

---

## Metadata Baseline

Initial metadata rules may verify:

* `plugin.yaml` exists;
* required metadata is present;
* metadata schema is valid;
* version metadata is consistent;
* declared capabilities are structurally valid;
* dependencies are structurally valid.

---

## Structure Baseline

Initial structure rules may verify:

* supported package layout;
* required modules;
* expected manifest location;
* prohibited structural patterns.

Structural rules should validate real platform requirements rather than arbitrary repository preferences.

---

## Architecture Baseline

Initial architecture rules should focus on known stable boundaries.

Examples include:

* prohibited internal imports;
* supported public Plugin SDK usage;
* valid dependency direction;
* no forbidden platform coupling.

---

## Capability Baseline

Initial capability rules may verify:

* valid capability identifiers;
* declared implementation exists;
* capability registration is valid;
* capability implementation follows the supported contract.

---

## Contribution Baseline

Initial contribution validation may verify:

* known contribution types;
* valid contribution registration;
* contribution identities;
* expected contribution contracts.

---

## Dependency Baseline

Initial dependency rules may verify:

* dependencies are explicitly declared;
* prohibited dependencies are rejected;
* plugin dependencies reference known identifiers;
* architecture boundaries are preserved.

---

## Testing Baseline

The Compliance Framework should consume existing Testing Framework evidence.

Initial rules may require:

* required tests executed successfully;
* no required plugin tests failed;
* required contract tests exist where defined.

Compliance must not create a competing testing methodology.

---

## Quality Baseline

Initial quality rules should integrate existing engineering checks.

The first evidence integrations should prioritize:

```text
Ruff
MyPy
Pytest
```

where they already represent active FamilyOS engineering requirements.

---

## Documentation Baseline

Initial documentation rules may verify:

* required README exists;
* required documentation files exist;
* required documents are non-empty;
* required plugin documentation structure is present.

Deeper documentation-quality evaluation may mature later.

---

## Security Baseline

Security-critical requirements should be included from the first executable compliance release.

Initial rules should prevent obvious trust-boundary violations such as:

* compliance policy modification;
* prohibited internal access;
* insecure secret exposure;
* unsupported privileged behavior.

---

## Phase 7 — Official Plugin Pilot

### Objective

Validate the compliance system against real official FamilyOS plugins before broad enforcement.

### Candidate Plugins

A representative pilot may include:

```text
Security
Health
Finance
Education
Documents
Communication
```

The final pilot set may evolve.

### Pilot Strategy

The initial pilot should prefer:

```text
shadow
```

or advisory evaluation.

The goal is to identify framework defects before compliance begins blocking normal development.

### Pilot Measurements

Useful measurements include:

* rules evaluated;
* rule failures;
* false positives;
* validator failures;
* validation duration;
* remediation clarity;
* remediation duration;
* domain distribution.

### Exit Criteria

Phase 7 is complete when:

* high-impact false positives are resolved;
* core validators are reliable;
* findings are understandable;
* rule semantics are stable;
* profile behavior is predictable.

---

## Phase 8 — Developer CLI

### Objective

Expose compliance through the standard FamilyOS developer experience.

### Initial Commands

The CLI should eventually support operations conceptually equivalent to:

```text
familyos plugin compliance check
familyos plugin compliance check --profile official
familyos plugin compliance report
familyos plugin compliance rules
familyos plugin compliance explain
```

Exact command grammar belongs to implementation design.

### Required Output

Local execution should expose:

* plugin;
* profile;
* overall status;
* findings;
* severity;
* location;
* remediation;
* deterministic exit behavior.

### Exit Criteria

Phase 8 is complete when plugin developers can execute the same core compliance evaluation locally that CI will later consume.

---

## Phase 9 — Machine-Readable Reporting

### Objective

Provide a stable structured integration contract.

### Initial Format

The first canonical machine-readable projection should preferably be JSON.

It should include:

* schema version;
* evaluation identity;
* plugin identity;
* framework version;
* profile;
* rule outcomes;
* findings;
* evidence references;
* diagnostics;
* overall status.

### Exit Criteria

Phase 9 is complete when downstream tools no longer need to parse human-readable CLI output.

---

## Phase 10 — CI Integration

### Objective

Make plugin compliance a standard FamilyOS continuous-integration capability.

### Evidence Reuse

CI should reuse existing results from:

```text
Ruff
MyPy
Pytest
```

through evidence adapters where compatibility can be demonstrated.

### CI Flow

```text
Source
  │
  ├── Ruff
  ├── MyPy
  ├── Pytest
  │
  ▼
Engineering Evidence
  │
  ▼
Compliance Engine
  │
  ▼
Compliance Result
```

### Exit Criteria

Phase 10 is complete when:

* CI uses the same engine as local tooling;
* profile selection is explicit;
* structured artifacts are generated;
* local and CI semantics are tested for equivalence.

---

## Phase 11 — Merge Gate

### Objective

Introduce the first strong lifecycle enforcement point.

The initial Merge Gate should target official plugin changes.

### Baseline Policy

A simple initial model is:

```text
COMPLIANT      -> PASS
NON_COMPLIANT  -> BLOCK
INCOMPLETE     -> BLOCK
ERROR          -> BLOCK
```

Warning behavior should remain profile-driven.

### Exit Criteria

Phase 11 is complete when protected plugin changes cannot merge while required compliance remains unresolved.

---

## Phase 12 — Evidence Maturity

### Objective

Strengthen evidence beyond transient validator output.

### Capabilities

This phase should introduce:

* Evidence IDs;
* producer identity;
* producer versions;
* source revision binding;
* provenance;
* freshness;
* trust levels;
* evidence reuse;
* invalidation.

### Evidence Reuse

One evidence object should be reusable across compatible rules.

Example:

```text
Import Graph Evidence
        │
        ├── Architecture Rules
        ├── Dependency Rules
        └── Security Rules
```

### Exit Criteria

Phase 12 is complete when evidence can be reused safely without weakening correctness.

---

## Phase 13 — Incremental Validation Foundations

### Objective

Reduce unnecessary validation work while preserving semantic equivalence.

### Initial Strategy

The framework may begin tracking relationships between:

* changed files;
* evidence scope;
* validators;
* rule dependencies;
* compliance domains.

### Safety Principle

> Work may be skipped only when the framework can demonstrate that the skipped work cannot affect the current compliance result.

When uncertain, full validation remains the fallback.

---

## Phase 14 — Build Integration

### Objective

Connect compliance with governed plugin artifact creation.

### Source Validation

Before build, compliance may validate:

* architecture;
* metadata;
* testing;
* quality;
* documentation.

### Artifact Validation

After build, validation may inspect:

* packaged files;
* manifest;
* version;
* unexpected content;
* artifact digest.

### Exit Criteria

Phase 14 is complete when release-grade plugin artifacts can be associated with a specific compliance evaluation.

---

## Phase 15 — Artifact Binding

### Objective

Prevent compliance evidence for one artifact from being reused for another.

The required relationship is:

```text
Plugin Artifact
      │
      ▼
Artifact Digest
      │
      ▼
Compliance Evaluation
      │
      ▼
Bound Compliance Result
```

### Exit Criteria

Phase 15 is complete when FamilyOS can prove exactly which artifact a release-grade Compliance Result applies to.

---

## Phase 16 — Release Profile

### Objective

Introduce a stronger profile appropriate to official plugin releases.

The Release Profile may require:

* complete applicable rule evaluation;
* trusted CI evidence;
* quality evidence;
* test evidence;
* compatibility evidence;
* documentation compliance;
* artifact integrity.

### Exit Criteria

Phase 16 is complete when release-specific assurance is distinct from ordinary development or merge assurance.

---

## Phase 17 — Release Gate

### Objective

Prevent official plugin release when required compliance cannot be demonstrated.

### Expected Behavior

The Release Gate should normally block:

```text
NON_COMPLIANT
INCOMPLETE
ERROR
```

Only an appropriately governed:

```text
COMPLIANT
```

result should permit normal release progression.

### Exit Criteria

Phase 17 is complete when official release workflows consume canonical compliance decisions rather than implement separate validation policy.

---

## Phase 18 — Governance Automation

### Objective

Move compliance policy toward structured, validated Compliance as Code.

### Potential Structure

A future repository structure may include:

```text
compliance/
├── rules/
├── profiles/
├── gates/
└── schemas/
```

Exact paths belong to implementation architecture.

### Policy CI

Policy changes should validate:

* schema correctness;
* unique Rule IDs;
* profile composition;
* dependency graphs;
* gate policy;
* rule tests;
* lifecycle metadata.

### Exit Criteria

Phase 18 is complete when compliance policy changes can be automatically checked before activation.

---

## Phase 19 — Rule Lifecycle Automation

### Objective

Make governance states operational.

The framework should support transitions such as:

```text
DRAFT
  │
  ▼
ACTIVE
  │
  ▼
DEPRECATED
  │
  ▼
RETIRED
```

Policy tooling should prevent invalid lifecycle transitions.

---

## Phase 20 — Compliance Drift Detection

### Objective

Identify when current plugin compliance differs from previous verified compliance.

Drift causes may include:

```text
PLUGIN_DRIFT
PLATFORM_DRIFT
DEPENDENCY_DRIFT
POLICY_DRIFT
TRUST_DRIFT
```

### Exit Criteria

Phase 20 is complete when maintainers can distinguish code regressions from ecosystem policy evolution.

---

## Phase 21 — Certification Profile

### Objective

Establish the strongest technical compliance profile required before certification governance.

The Certification Profile may require:

* complete evaluation;
* stronger evidence trust;
* exact artifact binding;
* restricted exceptions;
* no unresolved critical findings;
* accepted framework version.

---

## Phase 22 — Certification Eligibility

### Objective

Implement the technical bridge from compliance to certification.

The compliance system should produce states equivalent to:

```text
ELIGIBLE
NOT_ELIGIBLE
INCOMPLETE
ERROR
```

These states describe certification readiness.

They are not certification decisions.

---

## Phase 23 — Certification Evidence Package

### Objective

Produce a structured handoff for certification governance.

The package should contain:

* plugin identity;
* artifact identity;
* artifact digest;
* framework version;
* certification profile;
* Compliance Result;
* evidence manifest;
* exceptions;
* suppressions;
* integrity metadata.

### Exit Criteria

Phase 23 is complete when certification systems can consume compliance outputs without depending on validator internals or CLI text.

---

## Phase 24 — Certification Gate

### Objective

Confirm that certification-grade compliance requirements are satisfied before governance review begins.

The Certification Gate must remain separate from the final certification authority.

---

## Phase 25 — Security Hardening

### Objective

Strengthen the compliance infrastructure itself.

Capabilities should include stronger protection against:

* policy tampering;
* validator replacement;
* evidence forgery;
* artifact substitution;
* unauthorized exceptions;
* result manipulation.

---

## Phase 26 — Runtime Isolation

### Objective

Prepare compliance execution for plugins that cannot be assumed trusted.

Where plugin code must execute, validation should support:

* timeouts;
* process isolation;
* credential restrictions;
* filesystem boundaries;
* network restrictions;
* resource limits.

Static validation should remain preferred where runtime execution is unnecessary.

---

## Phase 27 — Third-Party Profile

### Objective

Define a public compliance profile suitable for external plugin authors.

The profile should focus on public platform contracts including:

* metadata;
* structure;
* public API usage;
* capabilities;
* contributions;
* dependencies;
* security;
* testing;
* documentation;
* compatibility;
* lifecycle behavior.

It must avoid internal FamilyOS workflow requirements that external authors cannot reasonably satisfy.

---

## Phase 28 — Third-Party Developer Tooling

### Objective

Allow independent plugin authors to evaluate compliance before submitting or distributing plugins.

External developers should receive:

* public Rule IDs;
* public profile documentation;
* CLI validation;
* actionable findings;
* remediation guidance;
* compatibility information.

### Exit Criteria

Phase 28 is complete when compliance can be understood and executed without private FamilyOS engineering knowledge.

---

## Phase 29 — Third-Party Validation Infrastructure

### Objective

Run untrusted plugin validation safely.

A target architecture is:

```text
Third-Party Plugin
        │
        ▼
Static Validation
        │
        ▼
Controlled Runtime Validation
        │
        ▼
Trusted Evidence
        │
        ▼
Compliance Result
```

### Exit Criteria

Phase 29 is complete when external plugins can be evaluated without granting them implicit trust in the validation environment.

---

## Phase 30 — Continuous Revalidation

### Objective

Transform compliance from an event into a persistent ecosystem capability.

Potential triggers include:

```text
Plugin Change
Platform Release
Rule Change
Dependency Change
Security Advisory
Trust Change
Certification Renewal
```

Revalidation should remain scoped where correctness can be demonstrated.

---

## Phase 31 — Trust Attestation

### Objective

Strengthen evidence portability across distributed systems.

Potential capabilities include:

* evidence digests;
* signed evidence;
* signed Compliance Results;
* trusted builder metadata;
* producer attestations;
* artifact attestations.

These capabilities extend the Evidence Model.

They do not replace it.

---

## Phase 32 — Supply Chain Integration

### Objective

Integrate compliance with future software supply-chain evidence.

Potential evidence sources include:

* artifact provenance;
* SBOMs;
* dependency attestations;
* build metadata;
* vulnerability data.

This phase should be coordinated with FamilyOS Security and Build architecture.

---

## Phase 33 — Plugin Registry Integration

### Objective

Expose governed compliance metadata through a future FamilyOS plugin registry.

A registry entry may eventually expose:

```text
Plugin
Version
Artifact Digest
Compatibility
Compliance Status
Compliance Profile
Framework Version
Certification Status
```

Sensitive evidence and findings should remain protected according to policy.

---

## Phase 34 — Registry Admission Gates

### Objective

Allow distribution environments to require specific assurance.

Conceptually:

```text
Development Registry
    -> Development Compliance

Official Registry
    -> Release Compliance

Certified Registry
    -> Certification
```

Registry policy must consume compliance and certification states without merging them.

---

## Phase 35 — Compliance Analytics

### Objective

Use compliance history to improve platform governance.

Potential analytics include:

* frequently failed rules;
* findings by domain;
* validator reliability;
* compliance drift;
* exception debt;
* remediation duration;
* profile adoption;
* ecosystem compliance trends.

Analytics should support engineering decisions.

They must not replace explicit rule evaluation.

---

## Phase 36 — Mature Compliance Platform

### Objective

Reach a state where plugin compliance is a permanent FamilyOS platform capability.

A mature system includes:

```text
Local Validation
CI Validation
Merge Enforcement
Build Assurance
Release Enforcement
Certification Integration
Third-Party Validation
Compliance Drift Detection
Continuous Revalidation
Governed Policy Evolution
Historical Compliance
```

At this stage, compliance is part of normal plugin lifecycle architecture rather than a separate initiative.

---

## Recommended Implementation Order

The recommended implementation order is:

```text
1. Core compliance models
2. Rule Registry
3. Profile Registry
4. Validator Registry
5. Validation Engine
6. Initial deterministic rules
7. Official plugin pilot
8. Developer CLI
9. JSON reporting
10. Ruff / MyPy / Pytest evidence integration
11. CI integration
12. Merge Gate
13. Evidence provenance and freshness
14. Evidence reuse
15. Incremental-validation foundations
16. Build integration
17. Artifact binding
18. Release Profile
19. Release Gate
20. Governance automation
21. Drift detection
22. Certification Profile
23. Certification eligibility
24. Certification evidence package
25. Security hardening
26. Runtime isolation
27. Third-party profile
28. Third-party developer tooling
29. Third-party validation infrastructure
30. Continuous revalidation
31. Attestation
32. Supply-chain integration
33. Registry integration
34. Ecosystem analytics
```

This order maximizes useful engineering value while preserving architectural dependencies.

---

## Recommended First Implementation Slice

The first implementation should remain intentionally constrained.

A strong first target is:

```text
One Official Plugin
        +
One Official Compliance Profile
        +
10–20 Deterministic Rules
        +
Core Validation Engine
        +
Human-Readable Report
        +
JSON Report
```

This slice should prove:

* model correctness;
* rule ergonomics;
* validator contracts;
* developer feedback;
* deterministic status derivation.

---

## Recommended Pilot Plugin

A pilot plugin should exercise a meaningful range of plugin architecture.

A suitable candidate should include several of:

* capabilities;
* contributions;
* policies;
* rules;
* recipes;
* templates;
* service boundaries;
* repositories;
* tests;
* documentation.

The final choice should be based on implementation readiness rather than roadmap preference alone.

---

## Implementation Dependency — Engineering Foundation

The Compliance Framework depends on the FamilyOS Engineering Foundation for:

* engineering standards;
* project structure;
* toolchain;
* configuration;
* lifecycle expectations.

Compliance should consume these foundations rather than duplicate them.

---

## Implementation Dependency — Plugin Architecture

Plugin Architecture remains authoritative for plugin contracts.

Compliance rules should enforce established contracts.

If architecture is ambiguous, the architecture must be clarified before compliance turns the ambiguity into enforcement.

---

## Implementation Dependency — Testing Framework

Testing evidence should come from the Testing Framework.

The Compliance Framework determines whether required testing assurance exists for a plugin profile.

It must not create a second testing architecture.

---

## Implementation Dependency — Quality Framework

Quality evidence should integrate existing FamilyOS quality systems.

Initial implementation should prioritize existing tooling before adding new quality mechanisms.

---

## Implementation Dependency — Documentation Framework

Documentation compliance should align with FamilyOS documentation standards.

The first implementation can focus on deterministic presence and structure before attempting deeper content validation.

---

## Implementation Dependency — Security Architecture

Security rules must derive from authoritative FamilyOS security requirements.

The Compliance Framework should not independently invent security policy.

---

## Implementation Dependency — Build Framework

Artifact-bound compliance depends on reliable build artifact identity.

Build integration should therefore mature before strong release or certification claims depend on artifact-level evidence.

---

## Implementation Dependency — Release Framework

Release workflows should consume compliance decisions.

They should not maintain independent duplicated plugin-compliance policy.

---

## Implementation Dependency — Certification Governance

Certification governance consumes certification-grade compliance outputs.

It remains responsible for final trust decisions.

---

## Delivery Risk — Excessive Initial Scope

Attempting to implement every compliance domain simultaneously would increase:

* complexity;
* validator instability;
* false positives;
* CI cost;
* governance overhead.

The roadmap deliberately favors narrow initial scope.

---

## Delivery Risk — Too Many Rules

A large rule catalog can appear mature while producing low-value noise.

Rule quality is more important than rule quantity.

Each rule should protect a meaningful platform contract.

---

## Delivery Risk — False Positives

False positives undermine developer trust.

Blocking enforcement should follow sufficient real-plugin pilot validation.

Rules with uncertain semantics should remain:

```text
DRAFT
```

or non-blocking until reliable.

---

## Delivery Risk — Duplicate Engineering Work

Compliance should not rerun expensive tools unnecessarily.

Existing:

```text
Ruff
MyPy
Pytest
```

evidence should be reused when provenance and context permit it.

---

## Delivery Risk — Weak Remediation

A technically correct finding that developers cannot understand becomes operationally expensive.

Remediation quality should therefore be treated as a first-class requirement.

---

## Delivery Risk — CI Performance

Full compliance evaluation may become expensive as rules grow.

Performance evolution should include:

* validator reuse;
* evidence reuse;
* caching;
* parallel execution;
* incremental validation.

Correctness remains the priority.

---

## Delivery Risk — Policy Hidden in Code

Allowing validator implementations to define undocumented requirements would undermine governance.

Policy representation and validator implementation must remain distinct.

---

## Delivery Risk — Premature Release Enforcement

A framework should not block releases before it demonstrates sufficient reliability.

Release enforcement should follow:

* stable rules;
* reliable validators;
* successful official-plugin pilot;
* mature reporting;
* governed exception paths.

---

## Delivery Risk — Premature Certification

Certification built on weak evidence creates false trust.

Certification readiness must follow:

* strong profiles;
* trusted evidence;
* artifact binding;
* release-grade validation.

---

## Delivery Risk — Premature Third-Party Exposure

External ecosystems magnify unstable contracts.

Third-party support should follow:

* stable public requirements;
* reliable tooling;
* strong remediation;
* runtime isolation;
* trust-aware evidence.

---

## Delivery Risk — Governance Debt

A growing rule catalog without ownership and lifecycle controls becomes difficult to maintain.

Governance automation should mature before compliance policy becomes large.

---

## Delivery Risk — Exception Debt

Frequent long-lived exceptions can indicate:

* poor rule design;
* incomplete migration;
* unrealistic profiles.

Exception metrics should therefore inform governance review.

## Delivery Risk — Compliance Drift

Plugins may become non-compliant without source changes.

This is expected as:

* rules;
* platform versions;
* dependencies;
* security policy;

evolve.

Drift detection must therefore be a planned framework capability.

---

* validation duration;
* evidence reuse rate;
* average remediation time;
* merge-gate adoption;

* third-party validation success rate.

Metrics support roadmap decisions.

They do not replace compliance semantics.

---

## Definition of Developer Success

The framework becomes useful to a plugin developer when the normal workflow becomes:

```text
Implement
    │
    ▼
Run Compliance
    │
    ▼
Understand Findings
    │
    ▼
Apply Remediation
    │
    ▼
Revalidate
    │
    ▼
Push
```

without requiring knowledge of validator internals.

---

## Definition of CI Success

The framework becomes useful to CI when:

```text
Same Plugin
+
Same Profile
+
Equivalent Context
```

produces equivalent compliance semantics locally and in CI.

---

## Definition of Release Success

Release integration succeeds when an official plugin cannot be released under a release-grade workflow without the required canonical Compliance Result and gate decision.

---

## Definition of Certification Success

Certification integration succeeds when certification governance can consume compliance eligibility and evidence without:

* parsing CLI output;
* rerunning independent compliance policy;
* depending on validator internals.

---

## Definition of Third-Party Success

Third-party readiness succeeds when an independent developer can:

* understand FamilyOS plugin compliance;
* run validation;
* understand findings;
* remediate problems;
* prepare a plugin for ecosystem admission;

using public platform contracts.

---

## Definition of Ecosystem Success

The mature ecosystem should distinguish clearly between:

```text
Plugin Exists
Plugin Loads
Plugin Works
Plugin Is Compliant
Plugin Is Merge Eligible
Plugin Is Release Eligible
Plugin Is Certification Eligible
Plugin Is Certified
```

These are separate assurance claims.

---

## Roadmap Review

The roadmap should be reviewed after major milestones.

Review questions should include:

* are validators sufficiently reliable;
* are findings actionable;
* is rule growth controlled;
* are developers able to remediate efficiently;
* is evidence trustworthy enough for the next stage;
* is enforcement justified;
* is migration manageable;
* is the next maturity level necessary.

---

## Roadmap Flexibility

The roadmap defines strategic sequencing rather than rigid scheduling.

Some work may overlap.

For example:

* governance automation can begin before the Rule Catalog becomes large;
* security hardening should begin before third-party runtime execution;
* reporting should evolve alongside CI;
* evidence maturity may evolve while merge enforcement is introduced.

Dependencies must still be respected.

---

## Roadmap Change Governance

Changing implementation order does not automatically change compliance semantics.

However, roadmap changes that affect:

* framework contracts;
* required profiles;
* enforcement expectations;
* trust guarantees;
* certification boundaries;

must be reviewed through the appropriate framework governance mechanism.

---

## Roadmap Invariants

The roadmap establishes the following invariants:

1. Architecture precedes broad implementation.
2. Core semantic models precede lifecycle enforcement.
3. Rule quality takes priority over rule quantity.
4. Official plugins provide the first production pilot.
5. Developer feedback precedes strong enforcement.
6. Local and CI validation share one compliance model.
7. Existing engineering evidence should be reused when trustworthy.
8. Merge enforcement precedes broad release enforcement.
9. Evidence maturity precedes strong distributed trust claims.
10. Artifact binding precedes strong certification claims.
11. Certification eligibility remains distinct from certification.
12. Security hardening precedes broad untrusted plugin execution.
13. Third-party support requires stable public compliance contracts.
14. Incremental validation must preserve correctness.
15. Compliance drift is a planned lifecycle concern.
16. Continuous revalidation does not rewrite historical results.
17. Governance must scale alongside rule growth.
18. Migration is part of framework evolution.
19. Advanced trust capabilities extend the core evidence model.
20. The final target is continuous, governed, evidence-based plugin compliance.

## Roadmap Summary

EPIC-PLUGIN-002 should evolve through controlled increments rather than one monolithic implementation effort.

The roadmap can be summarized as:

```text
Define
  │
  ▼
Implement
  │
  ▼
Pilot
  │
  ▼
Integrate
  │
  ▼
Automate
  │
  ▼
Enforce
  │
  ▼
Strengthen Trust
  │
  ▼
Certify
  │
  ▼
Open to Third Parties
  │
  ▼
Continuously Revalidate
```

Each stage increases assurance while preserving one stable compliance language.

---

## Final Roadmap Principle

The governing roadmap principle of EPIC-PLUGIN-002 is:

> FamilyOS should increase plugin trust one verifiable layer at a time.

By beginning with explicit rules and deterministic local validation, then progressively introducing CI integration, evidence maturity, lifecycle enforcement, artifact trust, certification eligibility, secure third-party validation, and continuous revalidation, FamilyOS can build a durable plugin compliance capability without sacrificing architectural clarity or ecosystem stability.
