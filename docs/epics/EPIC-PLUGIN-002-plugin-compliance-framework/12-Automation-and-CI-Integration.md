# Plugin Compliance Framework

## 12 Automation and CI Integration

### Introduction

Automation and CI Integration define how the FamilyOS Plugin Compliance Framework participates in day-to-day engineering workflows.

Compliance must not exist only as a final manual review.

It must be available throughout the plugin lifecycle, from local development to CI, build, release, and certification readiness.

The target model is:

```text
Development
    │
    ▼
Local Compliance
    │
    ▼
Continuous Integration
    │
    ▼
Build Validation
    │
    ▼
Release Compliance
    │
    ▼
Certification Readiness
```

Each stage consumes the same governed compliance model while applying an appropriate profile, execution mode, and evidence policy.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of automation is to make plugin compliance:

* repeatable;
* fast;
* deterministic;
* consistently enforced;
* visible early;
* compatible with engineering pipelines;
* reusable across lifecycle stages.

Automation reduces reliance on manual interpretation and makes compliance part of the normal FamilyOS engineering lifecycle.

---

## Automation Principle

The governing automation principle is:

> Deterministic compliance requirements should be validated automatically as early as practical.

Manual review remains appropriate where engineering judgment is genuinely required.

It must not replace automation for requirements that can be reliably evaluated by tooling.

---

## Shift-Left Compliance

Compliance validation should begin during development.

The preferred workflow is:

```text
Implement
   │
   ▼
Validate Locally
   │
   ▼
Fix Findings
   │
   ▼
Commit
   │
   ▼
CI Validation
   │
   ▼
Merge
```

This prevents developers from discovering fundamental compliance violations only during release preparation.

---

## Local Development Integration

Plugin authors should be able to run compliance validation directly from their development environment.

Local validation should provide:

* fast feedback;
* actionable findings;
* rule identifiers;
* file and logical locations;
* remediation guidance;
* profile visibility;
* deterministic exit behavior.

Local workflows should use the same underlying compliance engine as CI.

---

## Local Validation Scope

Local validation may support several depths.

Conceptually:

```text
FAST
STANDARD
FULL
```

### FAST

Prioritizes inexpensive checks suitable for frequent execution.

Typical checks may include:

* metadata;
* structure;
* import boundaries;
* dependency declarations;
* capability schemas.

### STANDARD

Provides the default developer compliance evaluation.

It may include:

* static analysis;
* selected tests;
* quality checks;
* documentation checks.

### FULL

Attempts to evaluate the complete active compliance profile.

It is suitable before pushing or preparing a release candidate.

---

## CLI Integration

The FamilyOS CLI should provide a standard developer interface for compliance automation.

Conceptual commands may include:

```text
familyos plugin compliance check
familyos plugin compliance check --profile official
familyos plugin compliance check --mode full
familyos plugin compliance report
familyos plugin compliance rules
familyos plugin compliance explain
```

The exact CLI grammar belongs to the CLI implementation specification.

The architectural requirement is that CLI commands delegate to shared compliance services.

---

## CLI Exit Semantics

CLI commands must expose deterministic exit behavior for automation.

A conceptual mapping is:

```text
COMPLIANT      -> success
NON_COMPLIANT  -> compliance failure
INCOMPLETE     -> incomplete validation failure
ERROR          -> infrastructure failure
```

Distinct exit codes may be introduced to allow scripts and CI systems to distinguish these states.

The exact numerical values should be specified separately.

---

## Pre-Commit Integration

Fast compliance checks may eventually participate in local pre-commit workflows.

Suitable checks include:

* metadata validation;
* naming checks;
* structural validation;
* prohibited imports;
* lightweight static checks.

Pre-commit validation should remain fast.

Expensive or environment-dependent checks belong in later stages.

---

## Pre-Push Integration

A stronger validation mode may be appropriate before pushing changes.

A pre-push workflow may include:

```text
Static Analysis
Type Checking
Relevant Tests
Plugin Compliance
```

This can reduce unnecessary CI failures.

Pre-push checks should remain optional unless engineering policy makes them mandatory.

---

## Continuous Integration

CI is a primary enforcement point for plugin compliance.

CI validation must use the same:

* Rule Catalog;
* Compliance Profiles;
* Validation Engine;
* evidence semantics;
* decision policy;

used by local tooling.

This ensures consistency between developer and pipeline results.

---

## CI Pipeline Model

A conceptual plugin CI pipeline is:

```text
Checkout
   │
   ▼
Environment Setup
   │
   ▼
Static Analysis
   │
   ▼
Type Checking
   │
   ▼
Tests
   │
   ▼
Quality Gates
   │
   ▼
Plugin Compliance
   │
   ▼
Build Eligibility
```

The exact order may vary according to evidence reuse and performance requirements.

---

## CI Evidence Reuse

Compliance should reuse authoritative evidence already produced by CI.

For example:

```text
Ruff
  │
  └──► Static Analysis Evidence

MyPy
  │
  └──► Type Evidence

Pytest
  │
  └──► Test Evidence

Compliance Engine
  │
  └──► consumes all compatible evidence
```

This prevents unnecessary duplicate execution.

---

## CI Evidence Requirements

CI-produced evidence should identify:

* commit or source revision;
* plugin version;
* platform version;
* tool version;
* execution environment;
* result;
* artifact references where applicable.

This information allows the Compliance Engine to validate evidence compatibility.

---

## CI Profile Selection

The CI profile should be explicit.

Examples may include:

```text
development
official
third-party
release
```

CI must not silently choose a weaker profile when stronger validation fails.

The selected profile should appear in pipeline logs and compliance reports.

---

## Pull Request Integration

Compliance validation should integrate with pull request workflows.

A pull request may receive:

* compliance status;
* blocking findings;
* warning counts;
* links to detailed reports;
* file annotations;
* profile information.

This gives reviewers immediate visibility into plugin conformance.

---

## Pull Request Annotations

Where supported, findings may be mapped to source annotations.

For example:

```text
PLUGIN-ARCH-001
src/plugin/service.py:18

Unsupported internal runtime import.
```

Annotations should use canonical rule IDs and finding severity.

---

## Pull Request Summary

A concise pull request summary may include:

```text
Plugin Compliance: NON_COMPLIANT
Profile: official

Critical: 0
Errors: 2
Warnings: 1
Incomplete Rules: 0
```

Detailed findings remain available as artifacts or expanded output.

---

## Merge Gates

Compliance may participate in merge gates.

A protected branch may require:

```text
Compliance Status == COMPLIANT
```

for the required profile.

Alternatively, policy may permit warnings while blocking errors and critical findings.

Merge gate semantics must remain centrally governed.

---

## Mandatory Gate Protection

Certain requirements may be non-bypassable in ordinary workflows.

Examples include:

* critical security rules;
* prohibited architectural dependencies;
* invalid plugin identity;
* corrupted manifests.

Ordinary developer configuration must not disable mandatory compliance gates.

---

## Quality Gate Integration

Plugin compliance should integrate with the FamilyOS Quality Framework.

Quality evidence may include:

* Ruff results;
* MyPy results;
* test outcomes;
* quality metrics;
* maintainability checks.

Compliance rules determine how this evidence applies to plugins.

Quality tooling remains authoritative for its own validation semantics.

---

## Testing Framework Integration

The Testing Framework provides verification evidence required by plugin compliance.

Conceptually:

```text
Testing Framework
      │
      ▼
Test Evidence
      │
      ▼
Plugin Compliance
```

Compliance does not redefine test strategy.

It determines which testing evidence is required for the active plugin profile.

---

## Documentation Framework Integration

Documentation checks may run during CI.

Potential automated checks include:

* required file presence;
* required sections;
* broken references;
* metadata completeness;
* documentation schema validation.

Human documentation quality review may remain separate where required.

---

## Security Automation Integration

Security compliance may consume results from:

* static security analysis;
* dependency vulnerability checks;
* permission validation;
* secret detection;
* security-focused contract tests.

Security-critical failures may block subsequent lifecycle stages immediately.

---

## Dependency Automation

Dependency validation should be automatable.

Checks may include:

* undeclared imports;
* prohibited internal modules;
* version constraints;
* cyclic plugin dependencies;
* unsupported packages;
* dependency policy violations.

Dependency evidence may be produced once and reused across architecture, security, and compatibility rules.

---

## Build Integration

Compliance should participate in determining build eligibility.

A conceptual workflow is:

```text
Source
  │
  ▼
Engineering Validation
  │
  ▼
Compliance Gate
  │
  ├── FAIL ─► Build Blocked
  │
  └── PASS
       │
       ▼
     Build
```

Not every development build must require the strongest compliance profile.

Release builds should.

---

## Build Artifact Compliance

Compliance may be evaluated against both source and built artifacts.

Source validation can verify:

* structure;
* code boundaries;
* tests;
* documentation.

Artifact validation can verify:

* package contents;
* metadata;
* manifest integrity;
* version information;
* prohibited files;
* artifact compatibility.

Both may contribute to release readiness.

---

## Artifact Binding

Release-grade compliance should eventually bind results to an exact artifact.

Conceptually:

```text
Build Artifact
      │
      ▼
Artifact Digest
      │
      ▼
Compliance Evaluation
      │
      ▼
Bound Compliance Result
```

This prevents source-only evidence from being applied to a different packaged artifact.

---

## Release Pipeline Integration

The release pipeline should require an explicit Release Compliance Profile.

A typical workflow may be:

```text
Release Candidate
      │
      ▼
Full Tests
      │
      ▼
Quality Validation
      │
      ▼
Security Validation
      │
      ▼
Compliance Validation
      │
      ▼
Artifact Verification
      │
      ▼
Release Eligibility
```

Release compliance must use complete and appropriately trusted evidence.

---

## Release Blocking

A release should be blocked when the active release profile results in:

```text
NON_COMPLIANT
```

or:

```text
INCOMPLETE
```

unless explicit release governance defines another policy.

An `ERROR` state indicates that reliable compliance could not be established and should also prevent normal release.

---

## Release Candidate Revalidation

Every materially changed release candidate should be revalidated.

Changes that may require revalidation include:

* source changes;
* dependency changes;
* build configuration changes;
* artifact changes;
* platform compatibility changes;
* compliance rule changes.

Evidence reuse may optimize this process when context remains compatible.

---

## Certification Workflow Integration

Certification workflows consume compliance results produced under a certification-appropriate profile.

Conceptually:

```text
Release Artifact
      │
      ▼
Certification Compliance
      │
      ▼
Compliance Evidence Package
      │
      ▼
Certification Process
```

The compliance framework determines technical eligibility.

The certification process determines certification.

---

## Certification Evidence Requirements

Certification workflows may require stronger evidence than ordinary CI.

Possible requirements include:

* trusted CI provenance;
* exact artifact binding;
* complete evidence;
* accepted framework version;
* accepted profile;
* restricted exceptions;
* integrity metadata.

These requirements are expressed through profile and certification policy.

---

## Scheduled Revalidation

Stable plugins may require revalidation even without source changes.

Possible triggers include:

* dependency policy updates;
* security rule updates;
* platform changes;
* compliance framework changes;
* certification renewal.

Scheduled revalidation protects against compliance drift.

---

## Event-Driven Revalidation

Future automation may trigger compliance checks when specific ecosystem events occur.

Examples include:

```text
Platform Contract Updated
        │
        ▼
Affected Plugin Detection
        │
        ▼
Compliance Revalidation
```

or:

```text
Dependency Becomes Prohibited
        │
        ▼
Affected Plugin Detection
        │
        ▼
Compliance Revalidation
```

This capability may emerge after the initial framework implementation.

---

## Compliance Drift Detection

Automation should eventually detect differences between previous and current compliance state.

Example:

```text
Previous: COMPLIANT
Current: NON_COMPLIANT
```

with cause:

```text
PLUGIN-SEC-014 introduced by framework 2.0
```

This helps maintainers distinguish code regressions from policy evolution.

---

## Changed-Scope Validation

Incremental CI may validate only affected compliance areas where correctness can be preserved.

Examples:

```text
Documentation-only change
   -> documentation checks + dependent rules

Capability implementation change
   -> capability + testing + architecture checks

Dependency change
   -> dependency + security + compatibility checks
```

Full validation remains required when impact cannot be determined safely.

---

## Incremental Validation Principle

The governing incremental principle is:

> Validation may skip unaffected work only when unaffected status can be demonstrated.

Optimization must never rely on guesswork.

---

## Cache Integration

Automation may use caches for:

* dependency analysis;
* static analysis;
* test evidence;
* parsed metadata;
* documentation checks.

Cache reuse must preserve evidence freshness and compatibility rules.

A cache hit is not automatically valid compliance evidence.

---

## Cache Keys

Compliance-aware cache keys should incorporate relevant context such as:

```text
Plugin ID
Plugin Version
Source Revision
Platform Version
Validator Version
Configuration
Dependency State
```

Incomplete cache keys risk incorrect evidence reuse.

---

## Parallel CI Execution

Independent validation tasks may execute in parallel.

For example:

```text
               CI Validation
                    │
       ┌────────────┼────────────┐
       ▼            ▼            ▼
   Static        Tests        Security
   Analysis                    Checks
       │            │            │
       └────────────┼────────────┘
                    ▼
              Evidence Merge
                    │
                    ▼
             Compliance Engine
```

Parallel execution must not change result semantics.

---

## CI Failure Isolation

One validator failure should not necessarily prevent unrelated validators from completing.

The engine should collect as much reliable evidence as possible.

Affected rules may become:

```text
ERROR
```

or:

```text
NOT_EVALUATED
```

while independent rules continue.

---

## Fail-Fast Behavior

Some failures may justify immediate pipeline termination.

Examples include:

* invalid compliance configuration;
* corrupted rule catalog;
* critical security violation;
* invalid plugin identity preventing further evaluation.

Fail-fast behavior should be policy-driven.

It must not hide useful findings unnecessarily.

---

## Pipeline Stage Separation

CI may separate compliance work into stages.

For example:

```text
Stage 1 — Static Evidence
Stage 2 — Test Evidence
Stage 3 — Runtime Evidence
Stage 4 — Compliance Decision
```

This enables reuse of engineering outputs and clearer failure diagnosis.

---

## Compliance Decision Stage

The final compliance decision should run only after all required evidence-producing stages have completed or explicitly failed.

The decision stage consumes normalized evidence and derives:

```text
COMPLIANT
NON_COMPLIANT
INCOMPLETE
ERROR
```

It should not independently rerun all engineering tools unless required.

---

## Machine-Readable Artifacts

CI should publish structured compliance artifacts.

Potential artifacts include:

* compliance-result.json;
* compliance-report.json;
* findings report;
* evidence manifest;
* future attestation bundle.

Exact filenames belong to implementation specifications.

---

## Human CI Output

Human logs should remain concise.

Detailed reports should be available separately.

A recommended CI output pattern is:

```text
Plugin Compliance
-----------------
Plugin: communication
Profile: official
Status: NON_COMPLIANT

Blocking Findings: 2
Warnings: 3

Detailed report:
<artifact reference>
```

---

## Pipeline Determinism

Equivalent commits evaluated under equivalent environments should produce equivalent compliance semantics.

Pipeline timestamps, worker identifiers, and execution duration may differ.

Rule outcomes and policy interpretation should not.

---

## Environment Reproducibility

CI environments should minimize uncontrolled variation.

Compliance-sensitive execution should pin or identify:

* runtime version;
* dependencies;
* tooling versions;
* platform version;
* configuration.

This improves reproducibility.

---

## Dependency Locking

Release-grade validation should use deterministic dependency resolution where possible.

Evidence produced with uncontrolled dependency drift may not be suitable for release or certification.

---

## Matrix Validation

Some plugins may require validation against multiple platform or runtime versions.

Conceptually:

```text
Plugin
  │
  ├── FamilyOS 4.0 -> PASS
  ├── FamilyOS 4.1 -> PASS
  └── FamilyOS 5.0 -> FAIL
```

Matrix results may feed Compatibility domain rules.

---

## Platform Compatibility CI

Compatibility validation may use CI matrices to prove declared support.

For example:

```text
Supported Platform Versions
        │
        ▼
CI Matrix
        │
        ▼
Compatibility Evidence
        │
        ▼
Compliance
```

Declared compatibility without verification may be insufficient for stronger profiles.

---

## Plugin-to-Plugin Compatibility

Future CI workflows may validate combinations of dependent plugins.

This may become necessary when plugins declare explicit inter-plugin dependencies.

Such validation should be targeted rather than requiring all possible ecosystem combinations.

---

## Manual Review Gates

Some compliance profiles may require manual review.

CI should represent pending manual review explicitly.

For example:

```text
Automated Checks: PASS
Manual Architecture Review: PENDING

Overall Status: INCOMPLETE
```

The system must not report full compliance before required manual evidence exists.

---

## Approval Integration

Governed approvals may later integrate with compliance workflows.

Examples include:

* architecture exception approval;
* security exception approval;
* certification review approval.

Approval evidence must retain authority, scope, and expiration metadata.

---

## Exception Handling in CI

CI should validate configured exceptions before applying them.

Invalid conditions include:

* expired exception;
* wrong plugin scope;
* unauthorized approver;
* rule does not permit exceptions.

Invalid exceptions should generate governance findings.

---

## Suppression Handling in CI

Suppressions may reduce annotation noise or allow temporary developer workflows.

They must remain visible in structured output.

A suppressed critical finding should not automatically become non-blocking unless policy explicitly permits it.

---

## Automation Configuration

Compliance automation may require configuration.

Configuration may define:

* selected profile;
* execution mode;
* evidence sources;
* report formats;
* allowed optional validators;
* pipeline integration behavior.

Configuration must not permit unauthorized weakening of mandatory rules.

---

## Configuration Hierarchy

The framework should define predictable configuration precedence.

A conceptual hierarchy may be:

```text
Framework Defaults
      │
      ▼
Repository Configuration
      │
      ▼
Plugin Configuration
      │
      ▼
Explicit CLI / CI Request
```

Mandatory governance policy remains authoritative over all levels.

---

## Secure Configuration

Compliance configuration is part of the trust boundary.

Plugins must not be able to modify centralized rules or policy simply by changing local configuration.

The engine should distinguish:

* plugin-owned configuration;
* repository engineering configuration;
* compliance governance configuration.

---

## CI Security

CI compliance execution may process untrusted plugin code.

Security precautions may include:

* process isolation;
* restricted credentials;
* controlled network access;
* sandboxed runtime checks;
* resource limits.

Compliance automation must not introduce an execution path that compromises CI infrastructure.

---

## Untrusted Plugin Execution

Static validation should be preferred where runtime execution is unnecessary.

When plugin code must execute, the validation environment should reflect the plugin trust level.

Third-party plugin validation may require stronger isolation than trusted built-in plugin workflows.

---

## Resource Limits

Validators should support resource controls such as:

* timeouts;
* memory limits;
* process limits;
* filesystem boundaries;
* network restrictions.

Resource control is especially relevant for runtime and third-party validation.

---

## Automation Observability

Compliance automation should expose operational metrics.

Useful metrics include:

* compliance run duration;
* validator duration;
* pass/fail counts;
* incomplete runs;
* infrastructure errors;
* evidence reuse rate;
* cache effectiveness;
* compliance drift count.

These metrics describe the compliance system, not plugin compliance itself.

---

## Pipeline Diagnostics

CI failures should clearly distinguish:

```text
Plugin NON_COMPLIANT
```

from:

```text
Compliance Infrastructure ERROR
```

This distinction determines who must act and what remediation is appropriate.

---

## Developer Feedback Loop

Automation should create a short remediation cycle:

```text
CI Finding
   │
   ▼
Developer Reads Rule
   │
   ▼
Developer Applies Remediation
   │
   ▼
Local Revalidation
   │
   ▼
Push
   │
   ▼
CI Pass
```

The framework should optimize for this feedback loop.

---

## Compliance Baselines

Existing ecosystems may require temporary compliance baselines during framework adoption.

A baseline can record known findings while preventing new violations.

Such a mechanism must be governed carefully.

It must not redefine baseline failures as PASS.

---

## Baseline Model

A conceptual baseline workflow is:

```text
Known Findings
      │
      ▼
Compliance Baseline
      │
      ▼
New Evaluation
      │
   ┌──┴────────────┐
   ▼               ▼
Existing        New Finding
Finding         -> Block
Tracked
```

Baselines may assist migration but should not become permanent substitutes for remediation.

---

## Baseline Expiration

Baselines should have migration plans and eventual removal targets.

The framework should avoid indefinite technical-debt baselines.

---

## Branch Policy

Different branches may require different compliance profiles.

For example:

```text
feature/*     -> development
main          -> official
release/*     -> release
```

This may be useful operationally.

Branch policy belongs to engineering workflow governance, not rule semantics.

---

## Monorepo Integration

FamilyOS may validate multiple plugins within one repository.

Automation should support:

* plugin discovery;
* affected-plugin detection;
* per-plugin profile resolution;
* isolated compliance results;
* aggregate repository summaries.

One plugin failure should remain distinguishable from another plugin's result.

---

## Aggregate CI Reporting

A repository-wide summary may look like:

```text
Plugin Compliance Summary

security       COMPLIANT
health         COMPLIANT
finance        NON_COMPLIANT
education      COMPLIANT
documents      COMPLIANT
communication  COMPLIANT
```

Each plugin retains its own complete Compliance Result.

---

## Aggregate Status

Repository-level status may be derived from individual plugin results according to CI policy.

For example:

```text
Any required plugin NON_COMPLIANT
        │
        ▼
Repository Compliance Gate Fails
```

Aggregate status must not replace per-plugin details.

---

## Automation API

Automation systems should call stable compliance interfaces.

Conceptually:

```text
ComplianceEngine.evaluate(request)
```

CI-specific orchestration may wrap this interface but should not reimplement rule or decision semantics.

---

## Integration Contracts

The framework should define stable integration contracts for:

* CLI;
* CI;
* build systems;
* release systems;
* certification systems.

Integration contracts should depend on structured requests and results rather than human-readable output.

---

## Pipeline Portability

Compliance automation should avoid unnecessary dependence on one CI provider.

Core validation should remain portable across environments.

Provider-specific integrations may add:

* annotations;
* summaries;
* artifact publishing;
* status checks.

They must not change compliance meaning.

---

## Reproducible Local CI

Where practical, developers should be able to reproduce CI compliance behavior locally.

This may require:

* the same profile;
* the same toolchain;
* the same platform version;
* equivalent configuration.

Perfect infrastructure equivalence is not always possible, but semantic differences should be minimized.

---

## Automation Testing

Automation integration requires tests covering:

* CLI exit behavior;
* profile selection;
* CI evidence import;
* build gating;
* release gating;
* certification handoff;
* caching;
* invalidation;
* concurrency;
* incomplete evidence;
* infrastructure failure;
* exception handling;
* deterministic results.

---

## CI Contract Tests

FamilyOS should provide tests proving that local and CI consumers receive equivalent semantic results for identical contexts.

For example:

```text
Local Status == CI Status
Local Rule Outcomes == CI Rule Outcomes
Local Severity == CI Severity
```

Differences in evidence trust may be legitimate when profiles require them and must remain explicit.

---

## Automation Anti-Patterns

The framework must avoid several automation anti-patterns.

### CI-Only Compliance

Do not make fundamental compliance feedback available only after pushing code.

### Duplicate Policy

Do not create separate local and CI rule definitions.

### Silent Profile Fallback

Do not switch to a weaker profile when the requested profile fails.

### Tool Output Parsing as Policy

Do not derive compliance directly from fragile human-readable tool output when structured adapters are available.

### Stale Evidence Reuse

Do not reuse cached evidence without validating context.

### Pipeline Success by Suppression

Do not hide findings simply to make CI green.

### Build Before Compliance

Do not publish release artifacts before required compliance gates pass.

---

## Automation Maturity Model

Compliance automation may evolve through stages:

```text
Manual
  │
  ▼
Local Automation
  │
  ▼
CI Automation
  │
  ▼
Build / Release Gates
  │
  ▼
Certification Integration
  │
  ▼
Continuous Revalidation
```

EPIC-PLUGIN-002 establishes the architecture required for this progression.

---

## Initial Automation Baseline

The initial implementation should prioritize:

1. local compliance execution;
2. official plugin profile validation;
3. deterministic CLI exit status;
4. CI integration;
5. reuse of Ruff, MyPy, and Pytest evidence;
6. machine-readable compliance reports;
7. blocking compliance gates for official plugins.

More advanced automation can follow incrementally.

---

## Future Automation Capabilities

Future evolution may include:

* signed compliance attestations;
* remote evidence services;
* compliance registries;
* automated revalidation campaigns;
* impact-based validation;
* policy distribution;
* compliance dashboards;
* certification renewal automation.

These capabilities must extend the same central compliance model.

---

## Automation Invariants

The Automation and CI Integration model establishes the following invariants:

1. Local and CI validation use the same compliance semantics.
2. Deterministic requirements should be automated.
3. Compliance feedback should be available early.
4. CI profiles are explicit.
5. CI must not silently downgrade profiles.
6. Existing engineering evidence should be reused when valid.
7. Evidence reuse requires freshness and provenance checks.
8. Merge, build, and release gates derive from canonical compliance status.
9. Infrastructure failures remain distinct from plugin failures.
10. Mandatory rules cannot be disabled through ordinary pipeline configuration.
11. Release-grade compliance binds to exact source or artifacts where required.
12. Required manual review remains visible as incomplete validation until completed.
13. Automation optimizations must not change compliance meaning.
14. CI provider integrations do not redefine policy.
15. Human logs and machine reports represent the same Compliance Result.
16. Compliance configuration cannot override centralized mandatory governance.
17. Third-party plugin execution must respect appropriate isolation.
18. Historical pipeline results remain traceable.
19. Compliance drift should be detectable through revalidation.
20. Certification consumes compliance evidence rather than redefining validation.

## Automation Summary

FamilyOS plugin compliance must operate throughout the engineering lifecycle rather than only at its end.

The model can be summarized as:

```text
Shared Rules
    +
Shared Engine
    +
Trusted Evidence
    +
Lifecycle Profiles
    +
Automated Gates
    =
Continuous Plugin Compliance
```

Automation makes compliance consistent, scalable, and actionable.

## Final Automation Principle

The governing principle of automation and CI integration is:

> Compliance should be easiest to fix when the change is smallest.

By integrating compliance into local development, CI, build, release, and certification workflows, FamilyOS detects conformance problems early and prevents them from becoming ecosystem-level failures.
