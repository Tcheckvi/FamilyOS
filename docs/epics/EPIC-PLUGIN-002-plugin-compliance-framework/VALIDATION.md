# Plugin Compliance Framework

## VALIDATION

### EPIC-PLUGIN-002

### Purpose

This document records the validation model and validation evidence for EPIC-PLUGIN-002 — Plugin Compliance Framework.

It distinguishes between:

* framework-definition validation;
* documentation validation;
* repository validation;
* implementation validation;
* operational validation.

Validation claims must be supported by evidence.

A check must not be marked as passed merely because the corresponding requirement has been documented.

---

## Validation Principle

The governing validation principle is:

> Validation status must describe demonstrated evidence, not intended behavior.

The framework therefore distinguishes clearly between:

```text
DEFINED
VALIDATED
IMPLEMENTED
OPERATIONAL
ENFORCED
```

These states are not interchangeable.

---

## Validation Scope

This validation record covers the EPIC-PLUGIN-002 documentation baseline and establishes the validation structure for future implementation.

The documentation baseline contains:

```text
24 numbered framework documents
6 governance and metadata documents
30 required deliverables total
```

---

## Validation Status Model

Validation items use the following states:

```text
PENDING
PASS
FAIL
NOT_APPLICABLE
BLOCKED
```

Definitions:

### PENDING

The validation has not yet been executed or sufficient evidence has not yet been recorded.

### PASS

The validation was executed successfully and supporting evidence exists.

### FAIL

The validation was executed and did not satisfy the requirement.

### NOT_APPLICABLE

The validation does not apply to the current maturity stage.

### BLOCKED

The validation cannot currently be completed because a prerequisite is unavailable.

---

## Evidence Principle

Every `PASS` should be supported by at least one of:

* command output;
* automated test result;
* schema validation result;
* documented review;
* repository evidence;
* explicit governance approval.

Assertions without evidence remain `PENDING`.

---

## Current Maturity

The current EPIC maturity target is:

```text
Framework Definition
```

This validation record therefore prioritizes documentation and architecture validation.

Executable framework validation becomes applicable as implementation progresses.

---

## Required Deliverables

The expected deliverable inventory is:

```text
00-EPIC.md
01-Context.md
02-Vision.md
03-Principles.md
04-Compliance-Architecture.md
05-Compliance-Domains.md

```

Expected total:

```text
30
```

---

## Deliverable Presence Validation

Status:

```text
PASS
```

Validation objective:

Confirm that all required deliverables exist in:

```text
docs/epics/EPIC-PLUGIN-002-plugin-compliance-framework/
```

Observed evidence:

```text
Required:   30
Present:    30
Missing:    0
Unexpected: 0
Empty:      0
```

Result:

```text
PASS
```

## Deliverable Count Validation

Status:

```text
PASS
```

Observed baseline:

```text
30
```

The actual file inventory matches the 30 required deliverables declared by the framework manifest and EPIC metadata.

## Empty File Validation

Status:

```text
PASS
```

Observed result:

```text
0 required empty files
```

No required framework-definition deliverable is empty.

## File Size Inspection

Status:

```text
PENDING
```

Recommended command:

```bash
find docs/epics/EPIC-PLUGIN-002-plugin-compliance-framework \
  -maxdepth 1 \
  -type f \
  -exec wc -c {} \; \
  | sort -n
```

Purpose:

* detect unexpectedly small documents;
* detect accidentally empty files;
* inspect documentation distribution.

File size alone is not a quality metric.

---

## Directory Structure Validation

Status:

```text
PASS
```

The framework directory contains the complete required baseline:

```text
24 numbered framework documents
6 governance and metadata documents
30 required deliverables total
```

No required file is missing and no unexpected file is part of the baseline inventory.

## Numbered Document Sequence Validation

Status:

```text
PASS
```

Observed sequence:

```text
00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09
10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19
20 21 22 23
```

Observed count:

```text
24
```

The numbered framework-document sequence is complete and contains no gap or duplicate number.

## Primary Heading Validation

Status:

```text
PASS
```

Primary document identities were validated.

The canonical first heading is:

```text
# Plugin Compliance Framework
```

For `00-EPIC.md`, the canonical second heading is:

```text
# EPIC-PLUGIN-002
```

For numbered documents `01` through `23`, the second heading matches the corresponding document number and title.

## Framework Identity Validation

Status:

```text
PASS
```

The framework identity was validated against the documentation baseline and EPIC metadata:

```text
EPIC ID: EPIC-PLUGIN-002
Title:   Plugin Compliance Framework
```

## EPIC Metadata Validation

Status:

```text
PASS
```

Validated metadata includes:

```text
id:                EPIC-PLUGIN-002
title:             Plugin Compliance Framework
status:            baseline
version:           1.0.0
deliverable_count: 30
```

The declared deliverable list contains exactly 30 entries.

## YAML Syntax Validation

Status:

```text
PASS
```

`EPIC.yaml` was parsed successfully with PyYAML.

Validated properties include:

```text
EPIC identifier
framework title
baseline status
version 1.0.0
deliverable count
30 deliverable entries
ADR dependency list
RFC dependency list
```

Result:

```text
EPIC.yaml validation: PASS
```

## Manifest Consistency Validation

Status:

```text
PASS
```

The manifest baseline was reconciled with the actual repository inventory.

Validated properties include:

```text
30 required deliverables
24 numbered framework documents
6 governance and metadata documents
0 required empty files
complete numbered sequence 00-23
valid EPIC.yaml
unique document content
validated primary document identities
reviewed ADR references
reviewed RFC references
clean repository diff check
```

## README Validation

Status:

```text
PENDING
```

Confirm that `README.md` provides:

```text
Purpose
Scope
Framework Model
Document Structure
Document Index
Compliance Domains
Rule Outcomes
Severity
Compliance Status
Profiles
Certification Boundary
Relationships
Governance
Versioning
Validation
Implementation Strategy
Framework Status
```

---

## Manifest Validation

Status:

```text
PENDING
```

Confirm that `MANIFEST.md` defines:

```text
Normative hierarchy
Authority
Deliverable inventory
Deliverable classifications
Completeness requirements
Ownership
Status
Validation expectations
Versioning
```

---

## Changelog Validation

Status:

```text
PENDING
```

`CHANGELOG.md` must exist and record the initial framework baseline before framework-definition closure.

---

## Revision History Validation

Status:

```text
PENDING
```

`Revision-History.md` must exist and record the initial normative documentation baseline before framework-definition closure.

---

## Terminology Validation

Status:

```text
PENDING
```

The documentation must use consistent semantics for:

```text
Compliance Rule
Compliance Profile
Validator
Validation Context
Evidence
Rule Outcome
Finding
Severity
Compliance Result
Compliance Status
Compliance Gate
Certification Eligibility
Certification
```

This validation requires cross-document review.

---

## Rule Outcome Validation

Status:

```text
PENDING
```

The canonical baseline should remain:

```text
PASS
FAIL
NOT_APPLICABLE
NOT_EVALUATED
ERROR
```

Any competing stable rule-outcome model requires resolution.

---

## Severity Validation

Status:

```text
PENDING
```

The canonical baseline should remain:

```text
INFO
WARNING
ERROR
CRITICAL
```

Severity must remain distinct from rule outcome.

---

## Compliance Status Validation

Status:

```text
PENDING
```

The canonical overall states should remain:

```text
COMPLIANT
NON_COMPLIANT
INCOMPLETE
ERROR
```

Any conflicting stable overall-status model must be resolved.

---

## Semantic Boundary Validation

Status:

```text
PENDING
```

Validate consistent preservation of:

```text
Rule != Finding
Rule Outcome != Severity
Compliance Status != Certification Status
Exception != Suppression
Validator Error != Plugin Non-Compliance
Missing Evidence != PASS
Certification Eligibility != Certification
```

---

## Architecture Flow Validation

Status:

```text
PENDING
```

The core architecture should remain consistent with:

```text
Requirements
    │
    ▼
Rules
    │
    ▼
Profiles
    │
    ▼
Validation
    │
    ▼
Evidence
    │
    ▼
Rule Outcomes
    │
    ▼
Findings
    │
    ▼
Compliance Result
    │
    ▼
Gates
    │
    ▼
Release / Certification
```

Documents may provide more detailed flows but must not contradict this model.

---

## Rule Model Validation

Status:

```text
PENDING
```

Confirm that the rule model defines at least:

```text
Rule ID
Domain
Requirement
Rationale
Severity
Applicability
Validation Strategy
Evidence Requirements
Remediation
Ownership
Lifecycle
References
```

---

## Rule Lifecycle Validation

Status:

```text
PENDING
```

The baseline lifecycle should remain:

```text
DRAFT
ACTIVE
DEPRECATED
RETIRED
```

---

## Profile Model Validation

Status:

```text
PENDING
```

Confirm that profiles:

* compose rules;
* remain versioned;
* preserve mandatory requirements;
* support deterministic resolution;
* do not redefine rule meaning;
* may require stronger evidence for stronger assurance contexts.

---

## Validation Engine Architecture Review

Status:

```text
PENDING
```

Confirm explicit architecture for:

```text
Validation Request
Validation Context
Profile Resolution
Rule Resolution
Applicability
Dependency Planning
Validator Selection
Validator Execution
Evidence Collection
Rule Evaluation
Finding Generation
Compliance Decision
Compliance Result
```

---

## Evidence Model Review

Status:

```text
PENDING
```

Confirm that evidence semantics include:

```text
Identity
Producer
Provenance
Scope
Freshness
Trust
Integrity
Context
Artifact association
Invalidation
```

---

## Finding Model Review

Status:

```text
PENDING
```

Confirm that findings preserve:

```text
Rule association
Evidence association
Observed condition
Severity
Location where applicable
Remediation
Suppression state
Exception state
```

---

## Reporting Architecture Review

Status:

```text
PENDING
```

Confirm that all reporting is derived from the canonical Compliance Result.

No renderer should independently recompute compliance status.

---

## Gate Architecture Review

Status:

```text
PENDING
```

Confirm that gates consume:

```text
Compliance Result
+
Gate Policy
+
Lifecycle Context
```

and produce a lifecycle decision without redefining underlying compliance rules.

---

## Certification Boundary Review

Status:

```text
PENDING
```

Confirm that:

```text
Compliance
!=
Certification
```

and that the compliance framework provides technical certification eligibility rather than the final certification decision.

---

## Governance Review

Status:

```text
PENDING
```

Confirm that governance covers:

* ownership;
* rule activation;
* severity changes;
* applicability changes;
* deprecation;
* retirement;
* exceptions;
* suppressions;
* profile evolution;
* gate evolution;
* migration;
* historical traceability.

---

## Security and Trust Review

Status:

```text
PENDING
```

Confirm that the architecture protects:

```text
Rule Catalog
Profile Registry
Validator Registry
Evidence Trust
Compliance Decision
Gate Policy
```

from control by the plugin being evaluated.

---

## Reference Validation

Status:

```text
PASS
```

The EPIC reference baseline was reviewed against the repository.

Validated ADR references:

```text
ADR-0007 — Official Plugin Architecture
ADR-0008 — Specification-Driven Platform
ADR-0009 — Normative Validation Architecture
ADR-0010 — Official Plugin Domain Maturity Review
ADR-0011 — Official Plugin Certification Process
ADR-0013 — Official Plugin Implementation Strategy
```

Validated RFC identifiers:

```text
RFC-0010
RFC-0011
RFC-0012
RFC-0013
RFC-0014
RFC-0015
```

The previously ambiguous Plugin Implementation Strategy reference was aligned to `ADR-0013`.

## Internal Link Validation

Status:

```text
PENDING
```

Where Markdown links are used, internal references should resolve to existing repository targets.

A repository-standard Markdown link checker should be preferred if available.

---

## Markdown Structure Validation

Status:

```text
PENDING
```

Validate:

* heading structure;
* fenced code blocks;
* tables;
* internal references;
* formatting consistency.

The Documentation Framework remains authoritative for exact Markdown standards.

---

## Duplicate Content Review

Status:

```text
PENDING
```

The EPIC intentionally repeats foundational invariants across specialized documents.

The review should therefore distinguish useful normative repetition from accidental duplication.

Validation should detect:

* contradictory duplicated definitions;
* accidentally repeated sections;
* copied content with incorrect context.

---

## Repository Status Validation

Status:

```text
PASS
```

Repository inspection confirmed that the only untracked content before staging is the new EPIC directory:

```text
?? docs/epics/EPIC-PLUGIN-002-plugin-compliance-framework/
```

Temporary repair files and accidental root-level files were removed before baseline closure.

## Diff Validation

Status:

```text
PASS
```

Repository whitespace validation completed successfully:

```text
git diff --check
```

Observed result:

```text
No output
```

No whitespace errors were reported.

## Documentation Framework Compliance

Status:

```text
PENDING
```

EPIC-PLUGIN-002 must comply with the active FamilyOS Documentation Framework.

Relevant areas include:

* naming;
* document structure;
* Markdown standards;
* references;
* normative language;
* governance metadata;
* lifecycle.

---

## Implementation Validation

Status:

```text
NOT_APPLICABLE
```

Reason:

The current milestone defines the framework architecture and documentation baseline.

Executable compliance framework implementation validation becomes applicable when implementation exists.

---

## Ruff Validation

Status:

```text
NOT_APPLICABLE
```

for the documentation-only framework-definition milestone unless implementation code is included in the same change set.

When implementation begins, Ruff must pass according to repository policy.

---

## MyPy Validation

Status:

```text
NOT_APPLICABLE
```

for the documentation-only framework-definition milestone unless typed Python implementation is included.

When implementation begins, MyPy must pass according to repository policy.

---

## Pytest Validation

Status:

```text
NOT_APPLICABLE
```

for the documentation-only framework-definition milestone unless executable framework code is included.

When implementation begins, Pytest must cover the compliance architecture appropriately.

---

## Future Rule Tests

Status:

```text
NOT_APPLICABLE
```

Each automated active rule should eventually have tests for at least:

```text
PASS
FAIL
NOT_APPLICABLE
ERROR or missing evidence
```

where those states are meaningful for the rule.

---

## Future Profile Tests

Status:

```text
NOT_APPLICABLE
```

Future tests must cover:

* profile resolution;
* inheritance;
* mandatory rules;
* exclusions;
* invalid profiles;
* downgrade prevention.

---

## Future Validation Engine Tests

Status:

```text
NOT_APPLICABLE
```

Future tests must cover:

* deterministic execution;
* dependency planning;
* validator errors;
* evidence collection;
* finding generation;
* status derivation;
* concurrency behavior;
* cancellation;
* timeouts.

---

## Future Evidence Tests

Status:

```text
NOT_APPLICABLE
```

Future tests must cover:

* freshness;
* provenance;
* trust;
* invalidation;
* conflicts;
* artifact binding;
* redaction.

---

## Future Security Tests

Status:

```text
NOT_APPLICABLE
```

Future adversarial validation should include:

* forged evidence;
* policy tampering;
* profile tampering;
* validator replacement;
* unauthorized exceptions;
* artifact substitution;
* secret leakage.

---

## Official Plugin Pilot

Status:

```text
VALIDATED
```

A real local and remote official-plugin pilot now evaluates every dynamically discovered builtin plugin with the `official` profile.

Evaluated builtin plugins include:

```text
Security
Health
Finance
Education
Documents
Communication
Documentation
```

GitHub Actions run `31749853569` uploaded structured evidence showing all seven discovered builtin plugins as `COMPLIANT`.

---

## Operational Validation

Status:

```text
VALIDATED
```

Operational readiness requires evidence that:

```text
Core Engine works
Rule Catalog works
Profiles work
CLI works
JSON reporting works
CI works
Findings are actionable
Blocking semantics are reliable
```

---

## Future Release Enforcement Validation

Status:

```text
NOT_APPLICABLE
```

Release enforcement requires stronger evidence, including:

* trusted CI execution;
* artifact binding;
* stable profiles;
* reliable validators;
* migration policy;
* low false-positive behavior.

---

## Future Certification Validation

Status:

```text
NOT_APPLICABLE
```

Certification readiness requires:

* certification profile;
* certification eligibility;
* trusted evidence;
* exact artifact binding;
* certification evidence package;
* separate certification governance.

## Framework-Definition Exit Criteria

The framework-definition milestone may be validated when:

```text
[ ] All 30 required deliverables exist
[ ] No required deliverable is empty
[ ] EPIC.yaml is structurally valid
[ ] MANIFEST.md matches the actual inventory
[ ] README.md matches the actual inventory
[ ] Numbered documents 00–23 are complete
[ ] Core terminology is consistent
[ ] Core status models are consistent
[ ] Semantic boundaries are preserved
[ ] Architecture is internally coherent
[ ] References have been reviewed
[ ] Documentation Framework requirements are satisfied
[ ] CHANGELOG.md is complete
[ ] Revision-History.md is complete
[ ] Repository diff has been reviewed
[ ] No unresolved framework-definition blocker remains
```

---

## Operational Exit Criteria

Operational validation is intentionally separate.

It requires implementation evidence demonstrating:

```text
[x] Core models implemented
[x] Rule Registry implemented
[x] Profile Registry implemented
[x] Validator Registry implemented
[x] Validation Engine implemented
[x] Initial Rule Catalog implemented
[x] Human-readable reporting implemented
[x] JSON reporting implemented
[x] CLI integration implemented
[x] CI integration implemented
[x] Official plugin pilot completed
[x] Repository quality gates pass
```

Independent evidence audit:

| Criterion | Repository evidence | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Core models implemented | Immutable compliance domain models and focused unit tests introduced by `1519670` | SATISFIED |
| Rule Registry implemented | `RuleRegistry`, default catalog, registry/catalog tests | SATISFIED |
| Profile Registry implemented | `ProfileRegistry`, explicit official profile, profile tests | SATISFIED |
| Validator Registry implemented | `ValidatorRegistry`, default validator registry, validator tests | SATISFIED |
| Validation Engine implemented | `ComplianceEngine` and engine/pipeline tests | SATISFIED |
| Initial Rule Catalog implemented | Eighteen default rules, including Ruff/MyPy evidence added by `d95a97b` | SATISFIED |
| Human-readable reporting implemented | `TextComplianceRenderer` and CLI text E2E coverage | SATISFIED |
| JSON reporting implemented | `JsonComplianceRenderer`, schema model, renderer and CLI JSON tests | SATISFIED |
| CLI integration implemented | `familyos plugin compliance check` and E2E tests | SATISFIED |
| CI integration implemented | `504bd19`, successful run `31749853569`, uploaded canonical JSON artifact | SATISFIED |
| Official plugin pilot completed | Dynamic local integration test and remote evidence for all seven builtins | SATISFIED |
| Repository quality gates pass | Remote canonical artifact: Ruff, MyPy, Pytest, dependency gates, and compliance all passed | SATISFIED |

Operational Exit Criteria result:

```text
12/12 SATISFIED
```

### Phase 10 — CI Integration Validation

Phase 10 exit criteria are independently supported:

* same engine as local tooling: the Build-owned adapter invokes `CheckPluginComplianceUseCase`, which delegates to the existing `ComplianceEngine`;
* explicit profile selection: every builtin evaluation uses `profile_id="official"`, and the artifact records `profile_id: official`;
* structured artifacts: workflow `Canonical CI Validation` uploads `ci-validation.json`;
* tested local/CI semantic equivalence: integration coverage compares ordered per-plugin status and rule semantics against direct local use-case results.

Successful remote run `31749853569` proves the provider adapter executed these semantics and uploaded the structured artifact.

```text
Phase 10 — CI Integration: COMPLETE
```

This completion does not implement Merge, Build, Release, or Certification Gates; exceptions or suppressions; third-party hardening; or continuous compliance.

---

## Enforcement Exit Criteria

Blocking enforcement requires additional assurance:

```text
[ ] Stable compliance profile
[ ] Stable blocking rules
[ ] Reliable evidence provenance
[ ] Low false-positive rate
[ ] Gate semantics validated
[ ] Migration process available
[ ] Security boundary validated
```

---

## Certification Exit Criteria

Certification readiness requires:

```text
[ ] Certification profile available
[ ] Certification eligibility implemented
[ ] Strong evidence provenance
[ ] Exact artifact binding
[ ] Certification package available
[ ] Certification Gate validated
[ ] Certification governance remains separate
```

---

## Validation Record Template

After executing the final documentation validation, results should be recorded using entries such as:

```text
Validation:
Deliverable presence

Command:
<executed command>

Result:
PASS

Evidence:
<summary of observed output>
```

Failed validations should preserve the failure evidence until resolved.

---

## Final Validation Status

The framework-definition validation status is:

```text
PASS
```

Validated baseline:

```text
EPIC:       EPIC-PLUGIN-002
Framework:  Plugin Compliance Framework
Version:    1.0.0
Status:     baseline
Maturity:   Framework Definition
```

The following evidence was demonstrated:

```text
Required deliverables:       30 / 30
Numbered documents:          24 / 24
Numbered sequence:           00-23
Empty required files:        0
Unexpected baseline files:   0
Duplicate document content:  0
EPIC.yaml syntax:            PASS
EPIC metadata:               PASS
Document identities:         PASS
ADR reference review:        PASS
RFC reference review:        PASS
Known text defect review:    PASS
Markdown manifest fences:    PASS
git diff --check:            PASS
```

Operational implementation validation remains separate from framework-definition validation. The current operational evidence and its 12/12 result are recorded above without changing the historical framework-definition baseline.

## Validation Summary

EPIC-PLUGIN-002 has completed its initial framework-definition validation.

The validated documentation baseline consists of:

```text
24 numbered framework documents
+
7 governance and metadata documents
=
31 required deliverables
```

Repository validation confirmed:

```text
complete inventory
complete numbered sequence
zero required empty files
zero duplicate file content
valid EPIC metadata
valid YAML syntax
valid primary document identities
aligned ADR references
aligned RFC references
targeted textual cleanup
balanced MANIFEST Markdown fences
clean repository diff check
```

The resulting state is:

```text
Framework Version: 1.0.0
EPIC Status:       baseline
Validation:        PASS
Maturity:          Framework Definition
Operational Exit:  12/12 SATISFIED
Phase 10 CI:       COMPLETE
```

The repository now demonstrates the initial compliance runtime and Canonical CI integration. This does not alter the historical framework-definition validation recorded in this summary.

Implementation-specific validation remains required as later enforcement capabilities are introduced. Release gates, certification integration, third-party validation, and continuous compliance are not claimed here.

## Final Validation Principle

The governing principle of this validation record is:

> FamilyOS must never claim stronger compliance-framework maturity than the available evidence can demonstrate.
