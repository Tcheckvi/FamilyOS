# Plugin Compliance Framework

## MANIFEST

### EPIC-PLUGIN-002

### Purpose

This manifest defines the official documentation inventory, normative hierarchy, completeness requirements, ownership model, and status rules for EPIC-PLUGIN-002 — Plugin Compliance Framework.

It provides the authoritative structural view of the framework documentation set.

The manifest exists to ensure that the framework can be validated as a complete and governed FamilyOS Engineering Platform deliverable.

---

## Manifest Principle

The governing manifest principle is:

> A framework is structurally complete only when its authoritative deliverables, relationships, status, and validation expectations are explicitly known.

The presence of files alone does not establish framework completeness.

The files must collectively represent a coherent normative system.

---

## EPIC Identity

```text
EPIC ID:     EPIC-PLUGIN-002
Title:       Plugin Compliance Framework
Category:    Engineering Platform
Domain:      Plugin Ecosystem
Version:     1.0.0
Status:      Baseline
Maturity:    Framework Definition
```

---

## Framework Purpose

EPIC-PLUGIN-002 establishes the official FamilyOS architecture for determining whether plugins conform to platform requirements.

The framework coordinates requirements originating from:

* plugin architecture;
* engineering standards;
* security architecture;
* testing standards;
* quality standards;
* documentation standards;
* configuration architecture;
* compatibility requirements;
* lifecycle requirements;
* governance requirements.

It translates those requirements into governed and verifiable plugin compliance policy.

---

## Normative Hierarchy

The Plugin Compliance Framework exists within the broader FamilyOS normative hierarchy.

The conceptual hierarchy is:

```text
FamilyOS Engineering Constitution
        │
        ▼
Architecture Foundations
        │
        ▼
Architecture Decisions
        │
        ▼
RFCs and Specifications
        │
        ▼
Engineering Frameworks
        │
        ▼
Plugin Compliance Framework
        │
        ▼
Compliance Rules and Profiles
        │
        ▼
Validator Implementations
        │
        ▼
Compliance Results
        │
        ▼
Lifecycle Gates
```

Lower layers must not silently redefine higher-level requirements.

---

## Authority Principle

EPIC-PLUGIN-002 is authoritative for:

* plugin compliance architecture;
* compliance terminology;
* compliance domains;
* compliance rule semantics;
* compliance profile semantics;
* validation orchestration;
* evidence semantics;
* finding semantics;
* compliance status derivation;
* compliance reporting;
* compliance automation;
* compliance gates;
* compliance governance;
* compliance trust boundaries;
* compliance lifecycle.

It is not automatically authoritative for the original meaning of requirements owned by other FamilyOS foundations.

---

## External Authority

Examples of requirements remaining authoritative outside this EPIC include:

```text
Security requirements
    -> Security Architecture

Testing semantics
    -> Testing Framework

Quality semantics
    -> Quality Framework

Documentation standards
    -> Documentation Framework

Plugin contracts
    -> Plugin Architecture

Build semantics
    -> Build Framework

Release semantics
    -> Release Framework

Certification decisions
    -> Certification Governance
```

The Compliance Framework coordinates validation of these requirements.

It does not replace their source authority.

---

## Deliverable Inventory

EPIC-PLUGIN-002 contains 30 required deliverables.

They are divided into:

```text
24 numbered framework documents
+
6 governance and metadata documents
=

---

## Deliverable Count

The expected deliverable count is:

```text
30
```

A different count requires explicit review.

Additional supporting artifacts may be introduced later without changing the required baseline, provided the manifest is updated accordingly.

---

## Completeness Requirements

The framework documentation is structurally complete only when all required deliverables satisfy the following conditions:

```text
File exists
AND
File is non-empty
AND
File fulfills its declared purpose
AND
File is internally coherent
AND
File does not contradict higher authority
```

---

## Required File Rule

All 30 manifest deliverables are required for framework-definition completion.

Missing required files must prevent final documentation validation from being marked complete.

---

## Empty File Rule

A required file with zero meaningful content is considered missing for completeness purposes.

Placeholder-only content is also insufficient.

---

## Content Quality Rule

File existence alone does not establish completeness.

A required document must contain enough information to fulfill its responsibility within the framework architecture.

---

## Internal Consistency

Documents must use consistent definitions for core concepts including:

```text
Compliance Rule
Compliance Profile
Validator
Evidence
Rule Outcome
Finding
Severity
Compliance Result
Compliance Status
Compliance Gate
Certification Eligibility
```

Contradictory definitions must be resolved before framework closure.

---

## Cross-Document Consistency

The following relationships require particular consistency:

```text
06-Compliance-Rule-Model.md
        ↕
07-Compliance-Profiles.md
```

```text
08-Validation-Engine.md
        ↕
09-Evidence-Model.md
        ↕
10-Findings-and-Severity-Model.md
```

```text
11-Compliance-Reporting.md
        ↕
13-Compliance-Gates.md
```

```text
13-Compliance-Gates.md
        ↕
14-Plugin-Certification-Integration.md
```

```text
15-Governance-and-Rule-Lifecycle.md
        ↕
17-Framework-Lifecycle.md
        ↕
22-Release.md
```

---

## Normative Conflict Rule

When documents within EPIC-PLUGIN-002 appear to conflict, resolution should follow:

1. foundational framework principles;
2. specialized normative document;
3. explicit governance decision;
4. corrected documentation.

Conflicts must not be resolved implicitly by implementation behavior.

---

## External Conflict Rule

If EPIC-PLUGIN-002 conflicts with a higher-authority FamilyOS source, the conflict must be resolved through the appropriate architecture or governance mechanism.

Possible mechanisms include:

* ADR;
* RFC;
* specification;
* framework revision;
* governance decision.

---

## Implementation Authority

Implementation must conform to the normative framework.

Implementation behavior does not become authoritative merely because it exists.

Conceptually:

```text
Normative Framework
        │
        ▼
Specification
        │
        ▼
Implementation
```

not:

```text
Implementation
        │
        ▼
Retroactive Policy
```

---

## Machine-Readable Authority

Future machine-readable rule or profile definitions may become executable policy artifacts.

When this occurs, the relationship between documentation and machine-readable policy must be explicit.

Neither representation should silently contradict the other.

---

## Ownership Model

The Plugin Compliance Framework belongs to the FamilyOS Engineering Platform governance domain.

Responsibility is distributed according to the requirement being enforced.

Conceptually:

```text
Plugin Platform Governance
        │
        ├── Compliance Architecture
        ├── Rule Model
        ├── Profiles
        ├── Validation Engine
        └── Compliance Lifecycle

Security Governance
        └── Security Requirements

Testing Governance
        └── Testing Requirements

Quality Governance
        └── Quality Requirements

Documentation Governance
        └── Documentation Requirements

Release Governance
        └── Release Enforcement

Certification Governance
        └── Certification Decision
```

---

## Rule Ownership

Every active compliance rule must eventually identify an accountable owner.

Ownership enables:

* review;
* maintenance;
* interpretation;
* deprecation;
* migration;
* exception governance.

Rules without ownership should not become stable blocking policy.

---

## Framework Ownership

Framework architecture changes require review appropriate to their impact.

Changes affecting foundational semantics may require formal architecture governance.

Examples include changes to:

* compliance status model;
* rule outcome model;
* evidence trust semantics;
* certification boundary;
* mandatory-rule semantics;
* gate semantics.

---

## Status Model

EPIC-PLUGIN-002 may progress through documentation and implementation maturity independently.

The current documentation maturity is:

```text
Framework Definition
```

The broader target progression is:

```text
Framework Definition
        │
        ▼
Implementation
        │
        ▼
Developer Preview
        │
        ▼
Operational
        │
        ▼
CI Enforced
        │
        ▼
Release Enforced
        │
        ▼
Certification Ready
        │
        ▼
Third-Party Ready
        │
        ▼
Continuous Compliance
```

---

## Documentation Status

Documentation status and implementation status must remain distinguishable.

For example:

```text
Documentation: Complete
Implementation: In Progress
```

is valid.

Documentation completion must never be interpreted automatically as operational framework completion.

---

## EPIC Status

The framework-definition baseline has completed its documentation validation.

The canonical EPIC metadata is:

```yaml
status: baseline
version: 1.0.0
```

The baseline status means that the normative framework definition represented by EPIC-PLUGIN-002 has been established, reviewed, and accepted as the initial FamilyOS Plugin Compliance Framework documentation baseline.

This status does not imply that every operational capability described by the framework has already been implemented.

## Completion Transition

The framework-definition transition has been completed.

The EPIC progressed from:

in-progress

to:

baseline

after validation confirmed the integrity of the initial documentation baseline.

Version 1.0.0 is therefore the first governed framework-definition baseline.

Operational implementation, CI enforcement, release enforcement, certification integration, third-party validation, and continuous compliance remain governed by the implementation roadmap and their respective maturity gates.

## Implementation Status

Implementation readiness is defined by `23-Checklist.md`.

Operational readiness is defined by `20-Validation.md`.

These states must not be inferred solely from the EPIC metadata status.

---

## Validation Ownership

Final documentation validation should verify:

```text
Manifest completeness
EPIC metadata consistency
File completeness
Heading structure
Terminology consistency
Cross-document consistency
Reference integrity
Governance completeness
```

Where implementation exists, repository engineering validation should additionally include the applicable quality gates.

---

## Validation Evidence

Validation evidence should be recorded in:

```text
VALIDATION.md
```

The validation record should identify:

* what was checked;
* which commands were executed;
* results;
* unresolved issues;
* final status.

---

## Versioning

This manifest belongs to the framework version declared in:

```text
EPIC.yaml
```

For the initial baseline:

```text
1.0.0
```

Changes to the required deliverable structure should be reflected in:

* `EPIC.yaml`;
* `MANIFEST.md`;
* `CHANGELOG.md`;
* `Revision-History.md`.

---

## Manifest Evolution

This manifest may evolve when:

* new required documents are introduced;
* documents are renamed;
* normative responsibilities move;
* governance artifacts change;
* framework structure changes.

Manifest changes must remain versioned and traceable.

---

## Historical Integrity

Previously released manifests should not be rewritten to represent newer framework structures.

A new framework version should document the new manifest state.

---

## Required Validation Commands

Before framework-definition closure, the repository should verify the directory structure.

Recommended inspection:

```bash
tree docs/epics/EPIC-PLUGIN-002-plugin-compliance-framework
```

Required file count may be inspected using repository-appropriate commands.

Required empty-file checks should also be performed.

---

## Expected Structural Result

The expected baseline is:

```text
30 required deliverables
0 required missing files
0 required empty files
```

Additional explicitly governed supporting files may exist.

---

## Manifest Validation Checklist

Before declaring the manifest valid:

```text
[ ] EPIC identity is correct
[ ] Framework title is correct
[ ] Version matches EPIC.yaml
[ ] Status matches EPIC.yaml
[ ] 30 required deliverables are listed
[ ] All numbered documents are represented
[ ] All governance files are represented
[ ] Normative hierarchy is explicit
[ ] Ownership model is explicit
[ ] Completeness rules are explicit
[ ] Validation expectations are explicit
[ ] Documentation and implementation status are separated
```

---

## Framework Definition Completion

The framework-definition baseline is complete.

Validated baseline properties include:

30 required deliverables
24 numbered framework documents
6 governance and metadata documents
0 required empty files
complete numbered sequence 00-23
valid EPIC.yaml
30 declared deliverables
unique document content
validated primary document identities
reviewed ADR references
reviewed RFC references
clean repository diff check

The framework-definition baseline therefore satisfies the documentation completion requirements for EPIC-PLUGIN-002 version 1.0.0.

This completion applies to the normative framework definition.

It does not claim completion of the future operational implementation.

## Manifest Summary

The EPIC-PLUGIN-002 manifest establishes the structural contract for the Plugin Compliance Framework documentation.

Its baseline is:

```text
24 Numbered Documents
        +
7 Governance Documents
        =
31 Required Deliverables
```

Together they define the architectural, policy, validation, governance, security, lifecycle, and delivery foundations of plugin compliance within FamilyOS.

---

## Final Manifest Principle

The governing principle of this manifest is:

> The Plugin Compliance Framework must be complete not only in file count, but in authority, structure, traceability, governance, and meaning.

This manifest therefore acts as the structural reference against which the EPIC-PLUGIN-002 framework-definition baseline is validated.
