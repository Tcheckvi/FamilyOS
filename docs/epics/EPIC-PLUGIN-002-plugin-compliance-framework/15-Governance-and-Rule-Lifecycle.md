# Plugin Compliance Framework

## 15 Governance and Rule Lifecycle

### Introduction

Governance and Rule Lifecycle define how FamilyOS creates, reviews, activates, evolves, deprecates, and retires plugin compliance requirements.

Compliance rules are platform contracts.

They therefore require stronger governance than ordinary implementation details.

A rule can affect:

* plugin architecture;
* release eligibility;
* certification eligibility;
* developer workflows;
* CI behavior;
* ecosystem compatibility;
* long-term maintenance obligations.

For this reason, compliance evolution must remain explicit, reviewable, versioned, traceable, and predictable.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of governance is to ensure that compliance requirements remain trustworthy over time.

The governance model provides the foundation required to:

* define rule ownership;
* control rule creation;
* review new requirements;
* assign severity;
* define applicability;
* approve validator bindings;
* activate rules safely;
* version compliance behavior;
* deprecate obsolete rules;
* retire rules without losing history;
* govern profile changes;
* manage exceptions;
* provide migration guidance;
* analyze ecosystem impact.

Governance protects both platform integrity and plugin authors from arbitrary compliance change.

---

## Governance Principle

The governing principle is:

> Compliance requirements must evolve as governed platform contracts, not as incidental validator behavior.

No validator implementation should silently introduce new compliance policy.

Every enforceable requirement must have an explicit governance path.

---

## Governance Scope

Compliance governance applies to:

* domains;
* rules;
* profiles;
* severities;
* applicability;
* validator bindings;
* evidence requirements;
* mandatory status;
* exception policies;
* suppressions;
* gate policies;
* certification eligibility requirements;
* rule documentation;
* lifecycle states.

Implementation details that do not alter compliance semantics may evolve through normal engineering processes.

---

## Governance Layers

The governance model separates several layers:

```text
FamilyOS Engineering Governance
            │
            ▼
Compliance Framework Governance
            │
     ┌──────┼────────┐
     ▼      ▼        ▼
   Rules  Profiles  Gates
     │      │        │
     └──────┼────────┘
            ▼
     Validation Semantics
```

Each layer has clear ownership and review responsibilities.

---

## Rule Ownership

Every active compliance rule must have an explicit owner.

Ownership identifies the authority responsible for the meaning and lifecycle of the requirement.

Potential owners include:

* Plugin Platform Governance;
* Architecture Governance;
* Security Governance;
* Testing Framework Governance;
* Quality Framework Governance;
* Documentation Governance;
* Release Governance.

Ownership may be represented by a team, role, or governed subsystem.

---

## Ownership Responsibilities

A rule owner is responsible for:

* validating requirement necessity;
* reviewing semantic changes;
* reviewing severity;
* reviewing applicability;
* maintaining rationale;
* maintaining remediation guidance;
* reviewing deprecation;
* coordinating migration;
* assessing ecosystem impact.

Ownership does not necessarily imply ownership of validator implementation.

---

## Source Authority

Every compliance rule should identify the platform requirement from which it derives.

Potential source authorities include:

```text
Engineering Constitution
Architecture Documents
ADR
RFC
Specification
Security Policy
Testing Framework
Quality Framework
Documentation Framework
Release Policy
```

The compliance rule translates that requirement into plugin-specific enforcement.

It does not replace the authoritative source.

---

## Rule Proposal

New compliance rules should begin as explicit proposals.

A rule proposal should define:

* problem being addressed;
* authoritative requirement source;
* proposed domain;
* normative requirement;
* rationale;
* applicability;
* severity;
* validation strategy;
* required evidence;
* remediation;
* compatibility impact.

A proposal should contain enough information for meaningful review before implementation begins.

---

## Rule Proposal Flow

A conceptual governance flow is:

```text
Requirement Identified
        │
        ▼
Rule Proposal
        │
        ▼
Domain Review
        │
        ▼
Compliance Review
        │
        ▼
Implementation
        │
        ▼
Rule Tests
        │
        ▼
Activation Decision
```

Not every proposed requirement must become an active compliance rule.

---

## Domain Review

The owning domain should first verify that the proposed rule:

* belongs to the correct domain;
* reflects an authoritative requirement;
* does not duplicate an existing rule;
* has appropriate scope;
* can be explained clearly;
* has reasonable remediation.

Cross-domain impact should be identified during this review.

---

## Compliance Review

Compliance review evaluates framework-wide implications.

Review should consider:

* rule identity;
* severity consistency;
* applicability semantics;
* evidence requirements;
* validator suitability;
* profile impact;
* gate impact;
* exception policy;
* versioning impact.

This prevents domain-specific decisions from introducing global inconsistency.

---

## Security Review

Rules affecting security boundaries may require dedicated security governance review.

Examples include:

* privileged operations;
* secret handling;
* trust boundaries;
* authorization;
* external communication;
* sensitive capabilities.

Security-critical rules may receive:

* mandatory status;
* stronger severity;
* restricted exceptions;
* stronger evidence requirements.

---

## Architecture Review

Architectural rules may require architecture governance approval.

Examples include:

* dependency direction;
* public API boundaries;
* module restrictions;
* capability boundaries;
* runtime access patterns.

Architecture review helps ensure that compliance enforcement reflects intentional platform architecture rather than temporary implementation structure.

---

## Rule Draft State

New rules should begin in:

```text
DRAFT
```

A draft rule may exist in documentation, tests, or experimental tooling.

Draft rules must not silently participate in stable compliance profiles.

---

## Draft Rule Objectives

Draft state allows:

* requirement refinement;
* validator development;
* test development;
* ecosystem impact analysis;
* developer feedback;
* documentation preparation.

The rule should become active only when its semantics and enforcement are sufficiently stable.

---

## Rule Lifecycle

The baseline lifecycle is:

```text
DRAFT
  │
  ▼
ACTIVE
  │
  ▼
DEPRECATED
  │
  ▼
RETIRED
```

Every transition must be explicit.

---

## Active State

`ACTIVE` means the rule is part of supported compliance policy.

An active rule:

* may participate in profiles;
* may affect compliance status;
* may affect gates;
* must have stable semantics;
* must have tests;
* must have documentation.

Activation is therefore a governance event.

---

## Activation Requirements

Before activation, an automated rule should normally have:

* stable Rule ID;
* authoritative source reference;
* defined severity;
* defined applicability;
* validator implementation;
* evidence requirements;
* passing tests;
* failing tests;
* not-applicable tests;
* error-path tests;
* remediation guidance;
* profile mapping.

Manual or hybrid rules require equivalent governance evidence appropriate to their validation mode.

---

## Activation Decision

A rule should become active only through explicit approval.

Activation should record:

* activation version;
* activation date;
* approving authority;
* affected profiles;
* migration impact;
* rollout policy.

This metadata supports historical interpretation.

---

## Rule Introduction Strategy

New rules may be introduced progressively.

A conceptual rollout may be:

```text
DRAFT
  │
  ▼
INFO / Advisory
  │
  ▼
WARNING
  │
  ▼
Blocking Enforcement
```

Progressive activation may reduce disruption for ecosystem-wide requirements.

Not all rules require gradual rollout.

Critical security requirements may require immediate enforcement.

---

## Shadow Validation

The framework may support shadow validation for new rules.

A shadow rule is evaluated and reported but does not yet affect canonical compliance status.

Conceptually:

```text
Rule Evaluated
      │
      ▼
Finding Visible
      │
      ▼
No Gate Impact Yet
```

Shadow validation helps measure ecosystem impact before enforcement.

---

## Shadow Rule Governance

Shadow mode must be explicit.

Reports should identify the rule as non-enforcing.

A shadow rule must not be confused with an active advisory rule.

---

## Rule Severity Governance

Severity assignment must be reviewed centrally.

The baseline model is:

```text
INFO
WARNING
ERROR
CRITICAL
```

Severity should reflect consequence of violation rather than difficulty of remediation.

---

## Severity Review Criteria

Severity decisions should consider:

* platform safety;
* security impact;
* architectural integrity;
* compatibility risk;
* data integrity;
* release risk;
* ecosystem fragmentation;
* remediation urgency.

Severity must not be chosen simply to force developer attention.

---

## Severity Changes

Changing severity may alter:

* compliance status;
* gate behavior;
* release eligibility;
* certification eligibility.

Severity changes therefore require version-aware governance and impact analysis.

---

## Rule Applicability Governance

Applicability determines which plugins and contexts a rule affects.

Changes to applicability can be breaking even when the rule requirement itself remains unchanged.

Examples include expanding from:

```text
official plugins
```

to:

```text
all plugins
```

or expanding from one capability type to several.

Applicability changes require explicit review.

---

## Mandatory Rule Governance

Mandatory rules create ecosystem-wide constraints.

A rule should become mandatory only when violating it would undermine fundamental:

* platform integrity;
* runtime safety;
* security;
* identity correctness;
* compliance trust.

Mandatory status should require elevated review.

---

## Exception Policy Governance

Each rule must define whether exceptions are allowed.

Possible models include:

```text
NONE
GOVERNED
TEMPORARY
PROFILE_SPECIFIC
```

Exception policy should reflect risk.

Security-critical rules may prohibit exceptions entirely.

---

## Validator Governance

Validators implement rule evaluation mechanisms.

Validator changes must be reviewed according to whether they alter compliance semantics.

A validator may be changed without a new Rule ID when:

* the requirement is unchanged;
* outcome semantics remain equivalent;
* evidence requirements remain equivalent.

---

## Semantic Validator Changes

A validator change is compliance-significant when it changes:

* what is accepted;
* what is rejected;
* evidence sufficiency;
* applicability;
* interpretation of the requirement.

Such changes require compliance governance review.

---

## Validator Replacement

A validator implementation may be replaced while preserving the rule identity if semantic equivalence is maintained.

Conceptually:

```text
Rule
 │
 ├── Validator v1
 │
 └── Validator v2
```

The rule remains the stable policy identity.

---

## Evidence Policy Governance

Changes to evidence requirements may strengthen or weaken compliance assurance.

Examples include changing from:

```text
local test evidence accepted
```

to:

```text
trusted CI evidence required
```

Such changes require explicit governance and may require profile version changes.

---

## Profile Governance

Compliance Profiles are governed artifacts.

Profile changes may include:

* adding rules;
* removing rules;
* changing inheritance;
* changing evidence requirements;
* changing severity thresholds;
* changing exception handling;
* changing lifecycle applicability.

Profiles must therefore have their own review and version lifecycle.

---

## Profile Change Review

Before changing an active profile, governance should evaluate:

* affected plugins;
* newly blocking findings;
* newly required evidence;
* migration difficulty;
* CI impact;
* release impact;
* certification impact.

Profile changes can be more disruptive than individual rule changes.

---

## Gate Governance

Compliance Gates convert compliance results into lifecycle decisions.

Gate policy changes may directly affect:

* merging;
* building;
* releasing;
* certification.

Gate changes require explicit engineering governance approval.

---

## Certification Policy Boundary

Compliance governance owns technical certification eligibility requirements.

Certification governance owns final certification policy.

Changes to certification profiles should therefore be coordinated across both governance domains.

---

## Versioning Strategy

Compliance governance must support explicit versioning.

Versioning may apply to:

* framework;
* rule catalog;
* profiles;
* report schema;
* gates;
* evidence schema.

These versions serve different purposes and must not be conflated.

---

## Framework Version

The Compliance Framework Version represents the overall supported compliance contract.

A framework release may bundle:

* rule catalog changes;
* profile changes;
* engine changes;
* evidence model changes;
* report changes.

Breaking policy changes may require a major framework version.

---

## Rule Catalog Version

The Rule Catalog may expose its own version or digest.

This identifies the exact rule set available during an evaluation.

It supports:

* reproducibility;
* audit;
* certification;
* historical comparison.

---

## Rule Version Semantics

A rule may retain one stable Rule ID while receiving non-semantic documentation or implementation updates.

Material requirement changes may require:

* a new rule version;
* or a new Rule ID.

The exact rule-versioning approach should prioritize historical clarity.

---

## Non-Breaking Rule Change

Typical non-breaking changes include:

* typo correction;
* improved explanation;
* improved remediation;
* additional references;
* equivalent validator optimization.

These may preserve current compliance semantics.

---

## Breaking Rule Change

Typical breaking changes include:

* stronger normative requirement;
* broader applicability;
* stricter accepted evidence;
* newly mandatory behavior;
* changed pass/fail semantics.

Breaking changes require explicit migration handling.

---

## New Rule vs Modified Rule

When a requirement changes materially, creating a new Rule ID is often preferable.

For example:

```text
PLUGIN-ARCH-001
      │
      ▼
Deprecated
      │
      ▼
PLUGIN-ARCH-014
```

This creates an unambiguous historical boundary.

---

## Deprecation

A rule enters `DEPRECATED` when it should no longer be used for new compliance policy but must remain available for compatibility or historical interpretation.

Deprecation must include:

* reason;
* deprecation version;
* replacement rule if available;
* migration guidance;
* expected retirement window.

---

## Deprecation Warning

Compliance tooling should be able to report deprecated rules when they remain active through compatibility profiles.

Developers should be informed before retirement affects their workflow.

---

## Rule Replacement

Replacement relationships should be machine-readable.

Conceptually:

```text
deprecated_rule:
  PLUGIN-ARCH-001

replaced_by:
  PLUGIN-ARCH-014
```

Tooling may then provide automatic migration references.

---

## Retirement

A rule enters `RETIRED` when it no longer participates in supported active profiles.

Retired rule metadata must remain available for:

* historical reports;
* certification records;
* old framework versions;
* migration analysis.

Retirement must not erase history.

---

## Historical Rule Registry

The framework should preserve enough rule metadata to interpret old results.

A historical registry may include:

```text
Rule ID
Domain
Requirement
Severity
Lifecycle
Introduced Version
Deprecated Version
Retired Version
Replacement
```

This registry may eventually be generated from version-controlled rule definitions.

---

## Profile Lifecycle

Profiles should follow a similar lifecycle:

```text
DRAFT
  │
  ▼
ACTIVE
  │
  ▼
DEPRECATED
  │
  ▼
RETIRED
```

Deprecated profiles remain necessary for interpreting historical Compliance Results.

---

## Gate Lifecycle

Gate policies may also evolve through governed versions.

A historical Gate Decision must always identify the exact gate version that produced it.

---

## Migration Guidance

Breaking compliance changes require migration guidance.

Migration guidance should explain:

* what changed;
* why it changed;
* which plugins are affected;
* how to remediate;
* enforcement timeline;
* compatibility window;
* relevant rule replacements.

Compliance evolution without migration guidance creates unnecessary ecosystem instability.

---

## Migration Window

Some breaking requirements may include a migration period.

Conceptually:

```text
Rule Introduced
      │
      ▼
Advisory Period
      │
      ▼
Warning Period
      │
      ▼
Blocking Enforcement
```

The duration depends on urgency and ecosystem impact.

---

## Immediate Enforcement

Not every requirement should receive a migration window.

Critical issues may require immediate enforcement.

Examples include:

* severe security vulnerabilities;
* integrity failures;
* compliance bypass mechanisms;
* dangerous runtime behavior.

Immediate enforcement should be justified explicitly.

---

## Compatibility Windows

The framework may support old and new profiles simultaneously during migration.

For example:

```text
official-v1
official-v2
```

for a limited period.

Compatibility windows should have clear expiration plans.

---

## Rule Impact Analysis

Before activating a significant rule change, FamilyOS should evaluate affected plugins.

Impact analysis may determine:

* number of affected plugins;
* number of expected failures;
* remediation complexity;
* domains affected;
* CI impact;
* release impact.

This is especially important for mandatory and blocking rules.

---

## Ecosystem Dry Run

The framework may support running proposed rules against existing plugins before activation.

Conceptually:

```text
Proposed Rule Set
      │
      ▼
Existing Plugin Ecosystem
      │
      ▼
Impact Report
```

This provides evidence for governance decisions.

---

## Rule Rollback

A newly activated rule may need to be rolled back if it produces unintended consequences.

Rollback should be governed and documented.

Historical evaluations produced while the rule was active remain valid for their original context.

---

## Emergency Rule Changes

Security or integrity incidents may require expedited rule changes.

Emergency governance should still record:

* reason;
* authority;
* affected rules;
* activation date;
* migration impact;
* follow-up review.

Emergency does not mean untraceable.

---

## Exception Governance

Exceptions require their own lifecycle.

A conceptual model is:

```text
REQUESTED
   │
   ▼
APPROVED / REJECTED
   │
   ▼
ACTIVE
   │
   ▼
EXPIRED / REVOKED
```

Exceptions must remain scoped and auditable.

---

## Exception Request

An exception request should identify:

* plugin;
* rule;
* reason;
* requested scope;
* requested duration;
* mitigation;
* owner;
* certification impact.

The request should explain why remediation cannot occur immediately.

---

## Exception Approval

Approval authority depends on rule ownership and severity.

For example:

```text
Architecture rule
  -> architecture authority

Security rule
  -> security authority
```

Higher-risk exceptions require stronger approval.

---

## Exception Expiration

Exceptions should normally expire.

Expiration creates a natural revalidation point.

Expired exceptions must stop influencing current compliance decisions.

---

## Exception Revocation

An approved exception may be revoked before expiration.

Possible reasons include:

* risk increase;
* changed platform state;
* changed plugin behavior;
* invalid justification;
* newly available remediation.

Revocation must be traceable.

---

## Suppression Governance

Suppressions require lighter governance than exceptions in some contexts, but they must remain visible.

Policies should define:

* who may suppress;
* maximum scope;
* allowed severities;
* expiration requirements;
* certification implications.

CRITICAL findings should rarely or never be suppressible.

---

## Governance Evidence

Governance actions should themselves produce structured evidence.

Examples include:

* rule approval;
* exception approval;
* profile activation;
* gate policy approval;
* manual review decision.

Governance evidence supports auditability.

---

## Decision Authority

Every governance decision should identify its authority.

Examples include:

```text
Architecture Governance
Security Governance
Plugin Platform Governance
Release Governance
Certification Governance
```

Authority must be distinct from ordinary plugin ownership when conflicts of interest may exist.

---

## Conflict of Interest

The framework should avoid allowing plugin authors to unilaterally approve exceptions to requirements governing their own plugins when stronger authority is required.

Governance policy should define separation of responsibilities where appropriate.

---

## Change Traceability

Every semantic compliance change should be traceable through version control and governance metadata.

A reviewer should be able to determine:

```text
What changed?
Why did it change?
Who approved it?
When did it become active?
Which plugins were affected?
```

---

## Changelog Integration

The framework should maintain a changelog for compliance-relevant evolution.

Changelog entries should identify:

* new rules;
* deprecated rules;
* retired rules;
* severity changes;
* profile changes;
* gate changes;
* major evidence-policy changes;
* migration requirements.

---

## Release Notes

Framework releases should communicate changes that plugin authors must understand.

Release notes should emphasize:

* newly blocking requirements;
* deprecations;
* migration deadlines;
* profile changes;
* certification impact.

---

## Governance Registry

The framework may eventually maintain an authoritative registry of governed artifacts.

Conceptually:

```text
GovernanceRegistry
├── Rule Catalog
├── Profile Registry
├── Gate Registry
├── Exception Registry
└── Lifecycle Metadata
```

The initial implementation may use version-controlled files rather than a dedicated service.

---

## Repository Governance

Compliance definitions stored in the repository should follow controlled review.

Changes to rule or profile definitions should require appropriate code ownership or review policies.

This helps prevent accidental compliance weakening.

---

## Policy-as-Code Governance

As the framework matures toward Compliance as Code, governance artifacts may become structured policy files.

For example:

```text
rules/
profiles/
gates/
exceptions/
```

Structured policy enables automation but increases the importance of review controls.

---

## Schema Validation

Governed policy artifacts should be schema-validated.

Invalid policy configuration must fail before it can influence plugin compliance.

Examples include:

* duplicate Rule IDs;
* unknown domain;
* invalid severity;
* broken profile references;
* circular rule dependencies;
* invalid replacement relationships.

---

## Governance CI

Changes to compliance policy should themselves pass CI.

Potential checks include:

* schema validation;
* rule tests;
* profile resolution tests;
* gate tests;
* duplicate detection;
* documentation generation;
* impact analysis.

The compliance framework should apply strong engineering quality to its own policy.

---

## Rule Test Governance

A rule should not become active without adequate tests.

Tests should prove:

* intended PASS behavior;
* intended FAIL behavior;
* applicability;
* prerequisite handling;
* evidence failure behavior;
* exception behavior where allowed.

Tests are part of rule governance evidence.

---

## Profile Test Governance

Profiles require tests confirming:

* included rules;
* inherited rules;
* mandatory rules;
* exclusions;
* severity policy;
* evidence requirements;
* profile resolution.

This prevents accidental weakening during evolution.

---

## Gate Test Governance

Gate changes require tests proving expected decisions for:

* COMPLIANT;
* NON_COMPLIANT;
* INCOMPLETE;
* ERROR;
* exceptions;
* mandatory failures;
* warnings.

---

## Documentation Governance

Rule and profile documentation should be generated or validated from structured policy wherever practical.

Documentation drift can undermine compliance transparency.

The authoritative source of semantics should remain clear.

---

## Rule Documentation Requirements

Every active rule should expose:

```text
Rule ID
Title
Requirement
Rationale
Domain
Severity
Applicability
Evidence Requirements
Remediation
Lifecycle
References
```

This should be discoverable by developers.

---

## Governance Transparency

Plugin authors should be able to understand current compliance requirements without inspecting internal implementation code.

The framework should make active:

* rules;
* profiles;
* severities;
* deprecations;
* migration guidance;

discoverable through documentation or tooling.

---

## Governance and Developer Experience

Good governance reduces surprise.

Developers should receive early visibility into:

* upcoming blocking rules;
* deprecated APIs;
* profile changes;
* migration deadlines;
* expiring exceptions.

Compliance governance should support predictable evolution rather than sudden breakage.

---

## Rule Adoption Strategy

The framework should prefer incremental adoption for broad non-critical rules.

A typical strategy may be:

```text
Document
   │
   ▼
Validate in Shadow Mode
   │
   ▼
Report Warning
   │
   ▼
Block in Strong Profiles
```

This balances platform evolution and ecosystem stability.

---

## Policy Compatibility

The framework should define compatibility expectations across framework versions.

A major framework upgrade may legitimately change compliance semantics.

Minor upgrades should generally avoid unexpected breaking enforcement changes unless explicitly governed.

---

## Historical Reproducibility

Old Compliance Results must remain interpretable after governance changes.

This requires preserving:

* framework version;
* profile version;
* rule identities;
* severity at evaluation time;
* evidence references;
* gate versions.

Historical interpretation must not depend solely on current policy.

---

## Re-Evaluation Under New Policy

A plugin may be re-evaluated under a newer framework version.

This creates a new Compliance Result.

Conceptually:

```text
Plugin v1.0
  │
  ├── Framework 1.0 -> COMPLIANT
  │
  └── Framework 2.0 -> NON_COMPLIANT
```

Both results can be correct in their respective contexts.

---

## Governance Metrics

FamilyOS may track governance metrics such as:

* new rules per release;
* deprecated rules;
* average migration window;
* exception count;
* exception age;
* blocking-rule frequency;
* rule rollback frequency;
* compliance drift after policy updates.

Metrics support governance improvement.

They must not determine rule correctness automatically.

---

## Governance Review Cadence

The framework may establish periodic review of:

* active rules;
* stale deprecations;
* long-lived exceptions;
* unused profiles;
* severity consistency;
* certification requirements.

Regular review prevents policy accumulation without maintenance.

---

## Exception Debt

Long-lived exceptions represent governance debt.

The framework should make exception debt visible.

Useful indicators include:

```text
Active Exceptions
Expired Exceptions
Average Exception Age
Rules Most Frequently Excepted
```

Frequent exceptions may indicate a poorly designed rule or unresolved ecosystem migration.

---

## Deprecation Debt

Deprecated rules should not remain indefinitely without retirement planning.

Governance should periodically evaluate whether compatibility needs still justify them.

---

## Rule Effectiveness Review

Rules may be reviewed for effectiveness.

Questions include:

* does the rule detect meaningful risk;
* does it generate excessive false positives;
* is remediation clear;
* is severity appropriate;
* is automation reliable;
* do developers frequently require exceptions.

A rule may be revised, replaced, or retired based on evidence.

---

## Governance Anti-Patterns

The framework must avoid several governance anti-patterns.

### Validator-Defined Policy

Do not allow implementation behavior to become undocumented compliance policy.

### Silent Rule Activation

Do not introduce blocking requirements without explicit activation.

### Rule Identity Reuse

Do not reuse an existing Rule ID for a materially different requirement.

### Permanent Exceptions

Do not allow temporary exceptions to become invisible permanent policy.

### Undocumented Severity Changes

Do not change enforcement impact without traceability.

### Profile Drift

Do not allow profile composition to change without versioning.

### Historical Deletion

Do not remove metadata required to interpret previous compliance results.

---

## Governance Invariants

The Governance and Rule Lifecycle model establishes the following invariants:

1. Every active rule has an explicit owner.
2. Every rule references an authoritative requirement source.
3. New rules begin in a non-enforcing lifecycle state.
4. Activation is an explicit governance event.
5. Active automated rules require tests.
6. Rule identities remain stable.
7. Materially changed requirements must preserve historical traceability.
8. Severity changes are governed.
9. Applicability changes are governed.
10. Mandatory status requires explicit approval.
11. Validator implementations do not independently define compliance policy.
12. Profiles are governed and versioned.
13. Gates are governed and versioned.
14. Exceptions remain explicit, scoped, and auditable.
15. Suppressions remain visible.
16. Deprecated rules identify migration paths where possible.
17. Retired rules remain historically interpretable.
18. Breaking changes require migration planning.
19. Historical Compliance Results remain immutable.
20. Plugin authors cannot silently weaken centralized requirements governing themselves.

---

## Reference Governance Model

The complete governance lifecycle is:

```text
Platform Requirement
        │
        ▼
Rule Proposal
        │
        ▼
Domain Review
        │
        ▼
Compliance Review
        │
        ▼
DRAFT Rule
        │
        ▼
Implementation and Tests
        │
        ▼
Activation Decision
        │
        ▼
ACTIVE Rule
        │
        ▼
Monitoring and Impact Review
        │
        ├── Continue
        │
        ├── Modify
        │
        └── Deprecate
                 │
                 ▼
            DEPRECATED
                 │
                 ▼
              RETIRED
```

This lifecycle ensures that compliance evolves deliberately rather than accidentally.

---

## Governance Summary

Compliance governance transforms plugin requirements into durable platform contracts.

The model can be summarized as:

```text
Requirement
    +
Ownership
    +
Review
    +
Versioning
    +
Testing
    +
Migration
    +
Lifecycle
    =
Governed Compliance Rule
```

This governance model allows FamilyOS to strengthen plugin requirements while preserving predictability and historical traceability.

---

## Final Governance Principle

The governing principle of compliance evolution is:

> A compliance rule may become stricter, broader, or obsolete, but it must never become ambiguous.

FamilyOS must therefore evolve plugin compliance through explicit ownership, review, versioning, migration, and lifecycle governance so that both the platform and its plugin ecosystem can change without losing trust.
