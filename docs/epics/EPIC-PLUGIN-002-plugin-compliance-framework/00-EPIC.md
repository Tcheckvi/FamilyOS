# Plugin Compliance Framework

## EPIC-PLUGIN-002

### Plugin Compliance Framework

### Overview

EPIC-PLUGIN-002 — Plugin Compliance Framework establishes the official compliance foundation for the FamilyOS plugin ecosystem.

The framework defines how plugins are evaluated, validated, governed, and prepared for certification against the architectural, engineering, security, testing, quality, documentation, compatibility, and lifecycle requirements of the FamilyOS platform.

As the plugin ecosystem grows, successful plugin execution alone is no longer sufficient.

A plugin must also demonstrate that it respects the contracts, boundaries, standards, and governance rules of the platform.

The Plugin Compliance Framework therefore introduces a systematic and enforceable model for determining whether a plugin conforms to the FamilyOS ecosystem.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of the Plugin Compliance Framework is to establish a unified compliance model for FamilyOS plugins.

The framework provides the foundation required to:

* define plugin compliance requirements;
* establish measurable compliance criteria;
* validate plugin architecture and structure;
* verify plugin metadata and manifests;
* enforce capability contracts;
* validate contribution declarations;
* verify dependency boundaries;
* enforce security requirements;
* integrate testing requirements;
* integrate quality requirements;
* validate documentation completeness;
* verify lifecycle compatibility;
* establish compliance levels;
* produce structured compliance findings;
* generate machine-readable compliance results;
* support plugin certification;
* integrate compliance validation into engineering workflows.

The framework transforms plugin compliance from an informal review activity into a repeatable engineering capability.

---

## Problem Statement

FamilyOS provides an extensible plugin architecture capable of supporting built-in, official, and future third-party plugins.

Extensibility introduces governance and engineering risks.

Without formal compliance validation, plugins could:

* violate architectural boundaries;
* bypass capability contracts;
* introduce unsupported dependencies;
* expose insecure behavior;
* declare invalid contributions;
* provide incomplete metadata;
* omit required tests;
* ignore documentation requirements;
* depend on internal platform implementation details;
* introduce incompatible lifecycle behavior;
* create unstable integration points.

These risks increase as the ecosystem expands.

FamilyOS therefore requires a formal mechanism capable of determining whether a plugin conforms to the platform engineering contract.

EPIC-PLUGIN-002 establishes that mechanism.

---

## Vision

Every FamilyOS plugin should be independently verifiable against a common set of platform requirements.

Plugin compliance must be:

* explicit;
* deterministic;
* measurable;
* reproducible;
* automatable;
* auditable;
* extensible;
* versioned;
* lifecycle-aware.

A plugin must never be considered compliant merely because it loads or executes successfully.

Compliance represents a stronger guarantee.

A compliant plugin demonstrates that it respects the architectural and engineering expectations of the FamilyOS ecosystem.

---

## Compliance Principle

The Plugin Compliance Framework follows a fundamental principle:

> Plugin extensibility must operate within explicit platform contracts.

Freedom to extend FamilyOS does not imply freedom to violate platform invariants.

Plugins may introduce domain behavior, capabilities, integrations, workflows, services, and contributions.

They must do so through officially supported extension mechanisms.

Compliance therefore acts as the boundary between ecosystem extensibility and platform integrity.

---

## Scope

The Plugin Compliance Framework covers compliance validation across the complete plugin lifecycle.

The framework includes:

* plugin identity compliance;
* metadata compliance;
* manifest compliance;
* structural compliance;
* architectural compliance;
* capability compliance;
* contribution compliance;
* dependency compliance;
* configuration compliance;
* security compliance;
* testing compliance;
* quality compliance;
* documentation compliance;
* compatibility compliance;
* lifecycle compliance;
* governance compliance;
* certification readiness;
* compliance reporting;
* compliance automation.

The framework applies to plugin packages and their declared integration with the FamilyOS platform.

---

## Compliance Domains

Plugin compliance is evaluated across multiple domains.

### Identity and Metadata Compliance

Plugins must expose valid, stable, and complete identities and metadata.

Validation includes:

* plugin identifiers;
* naming conventions;
* version declarations;
* ownership information;
* plugin classification;
* compatibility declarations;
* required metadata fields;
* metadata schemas;
* capability declarations;
* contribution declarations;
* dependency declarations.

---

### Structural Compliance

Plugins must follow the structural requirements established by the FamilyOS Plugin Architecture.

Validation may include:

* package organization;
* required files;
* manifest placement;
* module boundaries;
* supported extension points;
* prohibited structures.

---

### Architectural Compliance

Plugins must respect FamilyOS architectural boundaries.

A compliant plugin must not bypass official platform contracts or depend on unsupported internal implementation details.

Architectural compliance includes:

* layer boundaries;
* dependency direction;
* public API usage;
* runtime contracts;
* domain isolation;
* extension-point usage.

---

### Capability Compliance

Capabilities represent explicit contracts between plugins and the FamilyOS runtime.

Compliance validation must verify that capability declarations and implementations conform to their corresponding contracts.

Validation includes:

* capability identifiers;
* capability schemas;
* implementation contracts;
* registration rules;
* compatibility requirements.

---

### Contribution Compliance

Plugin contributions must use officially supported contribution mechanisms.

Compliance validation may cover:

* policies;
* rules;
* recipes;
* commands;
* services;
* workflows;
* integrations;
* other registered extension types.

Each contribution must satisfy the contract associated with its contribution type.

---

### Dependency Compliance

Plugin dependencies must remain explicit, controlled, and compatible with platform requirements.

Validation includes:

* declared dependencies;
* prohibited dependencies;
* dependency versions;
* plugin-to-plugin dependencies;
* platform dependencies;
* dependency cycles;
* internal implementation coupling.

---

### Security Compliance

Plugins must satisfy requirements established by the FamilyOS security architecture and governance model.

Security compliance may include:

* permission declarations;
* privileged operations;
* secret handling;
* data access;
* external communication;
* trust boundaries;
* security-sensitive capabilities.

---

### Testing Compliance

Plugins must provide the tests required by their classification and functionality.

Testing compliance integrates with the FamilyOS Testing Framework.

Validation may include:

* required test categories;
* capability tests;
* contribution tests;
* contract tests;
* integration tests;
* regression tests;
* compliance tests.

---

### Quality Compliance

Plugins must satisfy the engineering expectations established by the FamilyOS Quality Framework.

Quality compliance may evaluate:

* static analysis;
* type safety;
* code quality;
* maintainability;
* test results;
* quality gates;
* engineering standards.

---

### Documentation Compliance

Plugins must provide sufficient documentation for their purpose, contracts, configuration, capabilities, contributions, compatibility, and lifecycle.

Documentation compliance integrates with the FamilyOS Documentation Framework.

---

### Lifecycle Compliance

Plugins must behave correctly throughout their supported lifecycle.

Validation may cover:

* discovery;
* installation;
* registration;
* activation;
* execution;
* upgrade;
* deactivation;
* removal;
* compatibility transitions.

---

## Plugin Classification

Compliance requirements may vary according to plugin classification.

The framework recognizes categories such as:

* built-in plugins;
* official plugins;
* first-party extensions;
* third-party plugins;
* experimental plugins;
* development plugins.

Classification determines the depth and strictness of validation.

It must never eliminate fundamental platform integrity or security requirements.

---

## Compliance Model

The framework establishes progressive compliance states.

A conceptual lifecycle is:

```text
Unknown
   │
   ▼
Detected
   │
   ▼
Validated
   │
   ▼
Compliant
   │
   ▼
Certification Eligible
   │
   ▼
Certified
```

The detailed framework specifications define the exact state model and transition requirements.

Compliance status must always be based on explicit evidence.

---

## Compliance Rules

Compliance requirements should be represented as explicit rules wherever possible.

A compliance rule should define:

* rule identifier;
* compliance domain;
* requirement;
* severity;
* validation mechanism;
* failure condition;
* remediation guidance;
* applicable plugin classifications;
* framework version.

Rules should be independently testable and suitable for automation.

---

## Compliance Validation

Compliance validation must support both automated and human workflows.

The target validation model is:

```text
Plugin
  │
  ▼
Plugin Discovery
  │
  ▼
Metadata Validation
  │
  ▼
Structural Validation
  │
  ▼
Architecture Validation
  │
  ▼
Capability Validation
  │
  ▼
Contribution Validation
  │
  ▼
Dependency Validation
  │
  ▼
Security Validation
  │
  ▼
Testing and Quality Validation
  │
  ▼
Documentation Validation
  │
  ▼
Lifecycle Validation
  │
  ▼
Compliance Report
```

Validation should produce deterministic results whenever the same plugin, platform version, and compliance framework version are evaluated.

---

## Compliance Findings

Validation failures must produce structured findings.

A finding should identify:

* the violated rule;
* the affected plugin;
* the compliance domain;
* severity;
* evidence;
* location when applicable;
* remediation guidance.

Findings must support both developer consumption and automated processing.

---

## Compliance Reporting

Every complete compliance evaluation should produce a structured compliance report.

A report may contain:

```text
Plugin Identity
Plugin Version
Plugin Classification
Platform Version
Compliance Framework Version
Validation Timestamp
Compliance Status
Validated Domains
Passed Rules
Failed Rules
Warnings
Findings
Certification Eligibility
```

Reports should support both human-readable and machine-readable representations.

---

## Compliance Automation

Compliance validation must be designed for automation.

The framework should support integration with:

* local development workflows;
* FamilyOS CLI commands;
* test suites;
* CI pipelines;
* build pipelines;
* release pipelines;
* plugin publication workflows;
* certification workflows.

Plugin authors should be able to evaluate compliance before submitting or distributing a plugin.

---

## Compliance Gates

Compliance requirements may participate in engineering gates.

A typical workflow is:

```text
Development
    │
    ▼
Local Compliance Check
    │
    ▼
Testing
    │
    ▼
Quality Validation
    │
    ▼
Compliance Gate
    │
    ▼
Build
    │
    ▼
Release
    │
    ▼
Certification
```

Blocking requirements must always be explicit and governed.

---

## Relationship With Plugin Certification

Compliance and certification are related but distinct concepts.

Compliance determines whether a plugin satisfies defined technical and governance requirements.

Certification represents a stronger ecosystem decision that may include additional review, provenance, ownership, security, approval, or release requirements.

Therefore:

```text
Compliance
    │
    ▼
Certification Eligibility
    │
    ▼
Certification Process
    │
    ▼
Certified Plugin
```

Compliance becomes a prerequisite for certification whenever certification is required.

---

## Relationship With FamilyOS Foundations

The Plugin Compliance Framework integrates with the broader FamilyOS Engineering Platform.

Its principal relationships include:

```text
Engineering Foundation
        │
        ├── Documentation Framework
        ├── Testing Framework
        ├── Quality Framework
        ├── Security Architecture
        ├── Plugin Architecture
        │
        ▼
Plugin Compliance Framework
        │
        ▼
Plugin Certification
```

The framework consumes requirements established by these foundations and translates them into plugin-specific compliance rules.

---

## Relationship With Plugin Architecture

The FamilyOS Plugin Architecture defines how plugins integrate with the platform.

The Plugin Compliance Framework verifies that implementations respect those architectural contracts.

The architecture defines what is permitted.

The compliance framework verifies conformance.

---

## Relationship With Testing and Quality

Testing and quality systems provide evidence used during compliance evaluation.

The Plugin Compliance Framework does not replace either framework.

Instead:

```text
Testing ──────┐
              │
Quality ──────┼──► Compliance Evidence
              │
Architecture ─┤
              │
Security ─────┤
              │
Documentation ┘
                    │
                    ▼
            Compliance Evaluation
```

Compliance coordinates these sources of evidence into a plugin-specific decision.

---

## Governance

The Plugin Compliance Framework is governed as part of the FamilyOS Engineering Platform.

Changes to compliance requirements must be:

* documented;
* reviewed;
* versioned;
* traceable;
* lifecycle-aware;
* communicated to affected plugin authors.

Breaking compliance changes require explicit migration guidance.

---

## Versioning

Compliance requirements evolve with the FamilyOS platform.

Every compliance evaluation must therefore be associated with explicit version information.

At minimum:

```text
Plugin Version
Platform Version
Compliance Framework Version
```

This ensures that compliance decisions remain reproducible and auditable over time.

---

## Non-Goals

EPIC-PLUGIN-002 does not:

* define every plugin capability;
* define domain-specific business behavior;
* replace the Plugin Architecture;
* replace the Testing Framework;
* replace the Quality Framework;
* replace the Security Architecture;
* replace the Documentation Framework;
* guarantee plugin correctness;
* guarantee plugin security;
* automatically grant certification.

Instead, it coordinates these requirements into a unified plugin compliance model.

---

## Expected Outcomes

When EPIC-PLUGIN-002 is complete, FamilyOS will provide:

* an official plugin compliance model;
* explicit compliance domains;
* standardized compliance rules;
* plugin classification requirements;
* automated compliance validation;
* structured compliance findings;
* machine-readable compliance reports;
* developer-facing remediation guidance;
* compliance gates;
* certification readiness evaluation;
* lifecycle-aware validation;
* governance for compliance evolution.

---

## Success Criteria

EPIC-PLUGIN-002 is successful when:

* plugin compliance requirements are formally documented;
* compliance domains are clearly defined;
* requirements can be represented as explicit rules;
* plugin classifications have defined compliance expectations;
* compliance validation can be automated;
* validation results are deterministic and reproducible;
* findings contain actionable remediation information;
* compliance reports are machine-readable;
* compliance integrates with testing and quality workflows;
* compliance can participate in CI and release gates;
* certification processes can consume compliance evidence;
* framework evolution is governed and versioned.

---

## Strategic Impact

The Plugin Compliance Framework is a critical foundation for scaling the FamilyOS plugin ecosystem safely.

Without compliance governance, ecosystem growth increases architectural and operational risk.

With formal compliance validation, FamilyOS can preserve platform integrity while maintaining extensibility.

The ecosystem can therefore evolve from:

```text
Plugins that can run
```

to:

```text
Plugins that can be verified
```

and ultimately:

```text
Plugins that can be trusted
```

This transition is essential for a sustainable FamilyOS plugin ecosystem.

---

## Final Principle

The foundational principle of EPIC-PLUGIN-002 is:

> A FamilyOS plugin is not compliant because it works. It is compliant because its conformance to the platform contract can be demonstrated.

The Plugin Compliance Framework establishes the mechanisms required to make that demonstration systematic, reproducible, auditable, and enforceable.
