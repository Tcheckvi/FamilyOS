# Plugin Compliance Framework

## CHANGELOG

### EPIC-PLUGIN-002

All notable changes to the Plugin Compliance Framework documentation baseline are recorded in this file.

The changelog follows the FamilyOS principle that compliance policy evolution must remain explicit, versioned, traceable, and understandable.

---

## Changelog Principle

The governing changelog principle is:

> Any change that can alter the interpretation, implementation, validation, governance, or lifecycle of plugin compliance must remain historically visible.

The changelog records framework evolution.

It does not replace:

* Git history;
* `Revision-History.md`;
* rule lifecycle metadata;
* framework release records.

---

## Versioning

The initial framework baseline uses:

```text
1.0.0
```

Future entries should preserve semantic versioning expectations where applicable.

Typical interpretation:

```text
MAJOR
  Breaking compliance-semantic change

MINOR
  Backward-compatible capability or policy extension

PATCH
  Compatibility-preserving correction
```

The broader FamilyOS release strategy remains authoritative.

---

## [Unreleased]

No post-baseline framework changes are currently recorded.

Future normative, architectural, policy, governance, security, schema,
validation, or lifecycle changes must be recorded here before the next
framework release.

## [1.0.0] — Initial Framework Definition

### Status

```text
Planned Initial Baseline
```

This release establishes the first normative architecture and governance baseline for the FamilyOS Plugin Compliance Framework.

The initial framework-definition release does not imply that all roadmap implementation capabilities are operational.

Added:

* `08-Validation-Engine.md`.

Established the architecture for:

* validation requests;
* validation contexts;
* profile resolution;
* effective rule-set resolution;

PASS
FAIL
NOT_APPLICABLE
NOT_EVALUATED
ERROR
```

---

### Compliance Status

Established the canonical overall compliance states:

```text
COMPLIANT
NON_COMPLIANT
INCOMPLETE
ERROR
```

Defined overall compliance as a derived policy decision rather than a validator declaration.

---

### Compliance Reporting

Added:

* `11-Compliance-Reporting.md`.

Established structured reporting for:

* developers;
* CLI;
* JSON;
* CI;
* build;

---

## Defined

The initial framework baseline defines 30 required deliverables:

```text
24 numbered framework documents
+
6 governance and metadata documents
=
30 deliverables
```

---

## Defined — Rule Outcomes

The initial canonical rule outcomes are:

```text
PASS
FAIL
NOT_APPLICABLE
NOT_EVALUATED
ERROR
```

---

## Defined — Severity

The initial canonical severity levels are:

```text
INFO
WARNING
ERROR
CRITICAL
```

---

## Defined — Compliance Status

The initial overall compliance states are:

```text
COMPLIANT
NON_COMPLIANT
INCOMPLETE
ERROR
```

---

## Defined — Compliance Domains

The initial compliance domains are:

```text
Identity
Metadata
Structure
Architecture
Capabilities
Contributions
Dependencies
Configuration
Security
Testing
Quality
Documentation
Compatibility
Lifecycle
Governance
```

---

## Defined — Core Semantic Boundaries

The initial framework explicitly separates:

```text
Rule != Finding
Rule Outcome != Severity
Compliance Status != Certification Status
Exception != Suppression
Validator Error != Plugin Non-Compliance
Certification Eligibility != Certification
```

---

## Defined — Trust Boundary

The framework establishes that plugins may provide validation inputs but cannot control:

* authoritative rules;
* profiles;
* mandatory requirements;
* validator trust;
* evidence trust;
* overall compliance status;
* gate policy;
* certification eligibility.

---

## Defined — Initial Implementation Strategy

The initial recommended implementation slice is:

```text
One Official Plugin
        +
One Official Profile
        +
10–20 Deterministic Rules
        +
Core Validation Engine
        +
Human-Readable Report
        +
JSON Report
```

---

## Not Yet Implemented

The `1.0.0` framework-definition baseline does not by itself claim production implementation of:

* executable Rule Registry;
* executable Profile Registry;
* executable Validator Registry;
* Validation Engine runtime;
* compliance CLI commands;
* CI enforcement;
* merge gates;
* build gates;
* release gates;
* certification gates;
* attested evidence;
* third-party sandboxing;
* continuous revalidation.

These capabilities are planned through the implementation roadmap.

---

## Validation State

The initial `1.0.0` framework-definition baseline has completed
documentation validation.

Validated properties include:

```text
30 required deliverables present
24 numbered framework documents present
numbered sequence 00-23 complete
0 required empty files
0 unexpected baseline files
EPIC.yaml valid
deliverable count consistent
duplicate-content validation passed
document identity validation passed
ADR references reviewed
RFC references reviewed
known text defects reviewed
MANIFEST Markdown fences balanced
repository diff check passed
```

Framework-definition validation result:

```text
PASS
```

EPIC status:

```text
baseline
```

The historical documentation baseline did not itself imply operational implementation. Subsequent repository implementation and evidence are recorded below.

---

## Post-Baseline Implementation — Canonical CI Integration

Commit `1519670` implemented the initial Plugin Compliance runtime, including core models, registries, engine, initial rules, reporting, CLI integration, and official-plugin validation. Commit `d95a97b` added Ruff and MyPy compliance evidence.

Commit `504bd19` integrated those same local compliance semantics into the EPIC-BLD-001 Canonical CI Validation Baseline. The Build-owned adapter dynamically discovers builtin plugins, selects profile `official` explicitly, invokes `CheckPluginComplianceUseCase`, and projects deterministic per-plugin and rule outcomes into `ci-validation.json`.

The first real workflow execution identified a missing Health documentation template. Commit `c2ed8de` corrected that defect. GitHub Actions run `31749853569` then completed successfully and uploaded structured evidence reporting:

```text
Canonical CI Validation:       PASSED
Builtin Plugin Compliance:     PASSED
Compliance Profile:            official
Discovered Builtin Plugins:    7
Compliant Builtin Plugins:     7
Operational Exit Criteria:     12/12 SATISFIED
Phase 10 — CI Integration:     COMPLETE
```

This operational milestone does not implement Merge, Build, Release, or Certification Gates; exceptions or suppressions; third-party hardening; or continuous compliance. Framework version `1.0.0` and historical publication records remain unchanged.

---

## Migration

No previous Plugin Compliance Framework baseline exists.

Therefore:

```text
Migration Required: No
```

for the initial `1.0.0` framework-definition baseline.

Future breaking releases must provide migration guidance.

---

## Compatibility

The initial baseline defines architecture rather than an executable compatibility promise.

Operational compatibility requirements will become enforceable as:

* framework implementation;
* profiles;
* rule catalog;
* platform version integration;

mature.

---

## Security

The initial baseline establishes security and trust architecture but does not claim that all advanced runtime isolation and attestation capabilities are implemented.

Security implementation must progress according to the roadmap before third-party validation is considered mature.

---

## Release Notes Summary

Version `1.0.0` establishes the first complete architectural definition of FamilyOS plugin compliance.

The baseline enables implementation teams to begin building the compliance engine without inventing foundational semantics.

The principal outcome is a shared model for:

```text
Rules
Profiles
Validation
Evidence
Findings
Reporting
Gates
Governance
Trust
Certification Eligibility
```

---

## Future Changelog Requirements

Every future release should document, where applicable:

```text
Added Rules
Changed Rules
Deprecated Rules
Retired Rules
Severity Changes
Applicability Changes
Profile Changes
Gate Changes
Evidence Changes
Schema Changes
Security Changes
Migration Requirements
Revalidation Requirements
```

---

## Final Changelog Principle

The governing principle of this changelog is:

> Plugin compliance may evolve, but the history of that evolution must remain visible.

FamilyOS must therefore record meaningful compliance-framework changes in a way that allows developers, governance systems, release workflows, and certification processes to understand which policy existed at any point in the framework lifecycle.
