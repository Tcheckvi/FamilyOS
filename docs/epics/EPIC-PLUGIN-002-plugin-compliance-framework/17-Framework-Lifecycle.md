# Plugin Compliance Framework

## 17 Framework Lifecycle

### Introduction

The Plugin Compliance Framework is itself a governed FamilyOS engineering capability.

It must therefore evolve through a controlled lifecycle.

The framework will introduce new rules, profiles, validators, evidence models, gate policies, reporting capabilities, and certification integrations over time.

Without lifecycle governance, compliance evolution could become unpredictable and destabilize the plugin ecosystem.

The framework lifecycle must therefore preserve:

* compatibility;
* traceability;
* migration paths;
* version clarity;
* historical reproducibility;
* predictable enforcement;
* sustainable ecosystem evolution.

---

## Purpose

The Framework Lifecycle defines how EPIC-PLUGIN-002 evolves from initial implementation into a mature and long-lived FamilyOS platform capability.

It establishes guidance for:

* framework introduction;
* adoption;
* maturity stages;
* versioning;
* compatibility;
* migration;
* revalidation;
* deprecation;
* retirement;
* ecosystem impact;
* long-term evolution.

The lifecycle model applies to the framework as a whole rather than to individual rules only.

---

## Lifecycle Principle

The governing principle is:

> Compliance must become stronger over time without becoming unpredictable.

Framework evolution should improve platform assurance while preserving enough stability for plugin authors to adapt deliberately.

---

## Lifecycle Model

The conceptual framework lifecycle is:

```text
DEFINED
   │
   ▼
IMPLEMENTED
   │
   ▼
ADOPTED
   │
   ▼
ENFORCED
   │
   ▼
MATURE
   │
   ▼
EVOLVING
```

These stages describe maturity rather than mutually exclusive runtime states.

---

## Defined Stage

The Defined stage establishes the normative framework.

During this stage, FamilyOS defines:

* compliance philosophy;
* architecture;
* domains;
* rule model;
* profiles;
* evidence model;
* findings;
* reporting;
* gates;
* certification integration;
* governance.

EPIC-PLUGIN-002 documentation establishes this foundation.

---

## Implemented Stage

The Implemented stage introduces working compliance infrastructure.

Initial implementation should include:

* rule representation;
* validator contracts;
* profile resolution;
* evidence collection;
* findings;
* compliance results;
* CLI execution;
* basic reporting.

The implementation does not need every future capability immediately.

It must preserve the architectural contracts required for later growth.

---

## Adopted Stage

The Adopted stage begins when compliance validation becomes part of normal plugin engineering workflows.

Typical characteristics include:

* plugin authors run local compliance checks;
* CI executes compliance validation;
* official plugins are evaluated consistently;
* compliance reports become normal engineering artifacts;
* remediation uses stable rule identifiers.

Adoption should initially emphasize developer feedback rather than punitive enforcement.

---

## Enforced Stage

The Enforced stage begins when compliance results participate directly in lifecycle gates.

Examples include:

* merge gates;
* build gates;
* release gates;
* certification eligibility.

At this stage, rule quality and governance become especially important because compliance failures can block engineering progression.

---

## Mature Stage

A mature framework provides:

* stable rule catalogs;
* predictable profiles;
* strong automation;
* trusted evidence reuse;
* reproducible results;
* governed exceptions;
* compliance drift detection;
* release integration;
* certification integration;
* historical traceability.

Maturity does not mean the framework stops changing.

It means change occurs predictably.

---

## Evolution Stage

Once mature, the framework continues evolving alongside FamilyOS.

Evolution may introduce:

* new domains;
* new validators;
* new evidence types;
* stronger trust models;
* new certification targets;
* new ecosystem policies;
* third-party plugin support.

Framework evolution must preserve its foundational semantics.

---

## Initial Adoption Strategy

The initial adoption should prioritize official and built-in FamilyOS plugins.

These plugins provide a controlled environment for validating the framework itself.

The preferred sequence is:

```text
Framework Definition
      │
      ▼
Official Plugin Pilot
      │
      ▼
Rule Refinement
      │
      ▼
CI Integration
      │
      ▼
Release Enforcement
      │
      ▼
Third-Party Readiness
```

This reduces the risk of exposing unstable compliance policy to external plugin authors too early.

---

## Pilot Phase

A pilot phase should validate the practical behavior of:

* rule definitions;
* validators;
* profile composition;
* findings;
* remediation;
* reporting;
* CI integration.

Pilot rules may initially run in advisory or shadow mode.

---

## Shadow Adoption

Shadow validation allows FamilyOS to evaluate compliance without blocking workflows.

Conceptually:

```text
Plugin
  │
  ▼
Compliance Evaluation
  │
  ▼
Findings Reported
  │
  ▼
No Lifecycle Block
```

Shadow mode is especially useful when introducing broad new requirements.

---

## Advisory Adoption

After shadow validation, rules may become advisory.

Advisory rules provide visible warnings and remediation guidance.

They allow maintainers to correct issues before blocking enforcement begins.

---

## Enforcement Adoption

After migration readiness is demonstrated, applicable rules may become blocking under stronger profiles.

Conceptually:

```text
Shadow
  │
  ▼
Advisory
  │
  ▼
Warning
  │
  ▼
Blocking
```

Critical requirements may skip progressive rollout when immediate enforcement is necessary.

---

## Versioning Model

The framework must expose an explicit version.

Framework versioning communicates compatibility and policy evolution.

A semantic versioning model is appropriate conceptually:

```text
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
```

The exact release policy should align with the broader FamilyOS engineering platform.

---

## Major Versions

A major framework version may be required when changes materially alter compliance semantics.

Examples include:

* incompatible rule model changes;
* major profile restructuring;
* new mandatory ecosystem-wide requirements;
* incompatible evidence schema;
* breaking decision-policy changes.

Major upgrades require migration guidance.

---

## Minor Versions

Minor versions may introduce backward-compatible framework capabilities.

Examples include:

* new optional rules;
* new validators;
* new report renderers;
* additional evidence adapters;
* new non-breaking profiles.

Minor releases should avoid surprising existing stable profiles.

---

## Patch Versions

Patch releases should contain compatibility-preserving corrections such as:

* documentation fixes;
* validator bug fixes preserving semantics;
* reporting fixes;
* remediation improvements.

A patch release should not intentionally introduce a new blocking requirement.

---

## Framework Compatibility

A plugin compliance result is meaningful only relative to the framework version that produced it.

Conceptually:

```text
Plugin Version
      +
Platform Version
      +
Framework Version
      +
Profile Version
      =
Compliance Context
```

This context must remain attached to historical results.

---

## Backward Compatibility

Framework evolution should preserve backward compatibility where practical.

Compatibility may include:

* reading older compliance reports;
* interpreting retired rules;
* supporting older profiles temporarily;
* migrating older evidence formats.

Backward compatibility does not mean old compliance policy remains valid forever.

---

## Forward Compatibility

Older tooling may encounter newer framework artifacts.

Where possible, tooling should fail clearly rather than misinterpret unsupported policy.

For example:

```text
Unsupported Report Schema Version
```

is safer than silently ignoring unknown fields that may affect compliance meaning.

---

## Compatibility Windows

Major compliance changes may require temporary compatibility windows.

A compatibility window may support:

```text
Framework v1
Framework v2
```

in parallel for a defined period.

The window allows plugin maintainers to migrate before v1 enforcement is retired.

---

## Compatibility Window Policy

A compatibility window should define:

* supported framework versions;
* migration deadline;
* affected profiles;
* deprecated rules;
* replacement rules;
* retirement date.

Open-ended compatibility windows should be avoided.

---

## Migration

Framework migrations must be deliberate and documented.

A migration should explain:

* what changed;
* why it changed;
* which plugins are affected;
* which rules or profiles changed;
* how to validate migration;
* when enforcement changes.

Migration should be actionable rather than purely descriptive.

---

## Migration Artifacts

A framework release may provide:

* migration guides;
* profile-difference reports;
* deprecated rule mappings;
* CLI diagnostics;
* compatibility reports;
* automated migration helpers.

Automation should be preferred where migrations are mechanical and safe.

---

## Profile Migration

Plugins may need to migrate from one profile version to another.

For example:

```text
official-v1
      │
      ▼
official-v2
```

The framework should expose the additional or changed requirements.

---

## Rule Migration

Deprecated rules should identify replacements where possible.

Conceptually:

```text
PLUGIN-ARCH-004
      │
      ▼
Deprecated
      │
      ▼
PLUGIN-ARCH-011
```

Migration tooling should be able to explain the difference.

---

## Evidence Migration

Evidence schemas may evolve.

The framework should distinguish between:

* reusable historical evidence;
* evidence requiring conversion;
* evidence requiring regeneration.

Conversion must preserve provenance and integrity.

---

## Report Migration

Machine-readable report schemas may evolve independently of compliance semantics.

Consumers should use explicit schema versions.

Where practical, FamilyOS may support conversion between compatible report versions.

---

## Revalidation

Framework evolution may require existing plugins to be revalidated.

Revalidation triggers may include:

* new mandatory rules;
* platform changes;
* security policy changes;
* profile upgrades;
* validator semantic corrections;
* certification renewal.

Revalidation produces a new Compliance Result.

---

## Revalidation Principle

The governing principle is:

> Historical compliance remains historically valid, but current compliance requires current validation.

For example:

```text
Plugin 1.0
Framework 1.0 -> COMPLIANT

Plugin 1.0
Framework 2.0 -> NON_COMPLIANT
```

Both results may be correct.

---

## Revalidation Scope

Not every framework update requires full ecosystem revalidation.

Revalidation may be:

* full;
* domain-specific;
* rule-specific;
* profile-specific;
* affected-plugin-only.

Impact analysis should determine the minimum safe scope.

---

## Ecosystem Revalidation

High-impact framework changes may trigger ecosystem-wide revalidation.

Examples include:

* critical new security rule;
* architecture boundary change;
* evidence trust policy change.

The process should produce clear drift reports.

---

## Compliance Drift

Compliance Drift occurs when a plugin's current compliance state differs from its previous verified state.

Drift may result from:

* plugin changes;
* platform changes;
* dependency changes;
* framework changes;
* security changes.

The framework should identify the cause where possible.

---

## Drift Categories

Future tooling may classify drift as:

```text
PLUGIN_DRIFT
PLATFORM_DRIFT
DEPENDENCY_DRIFT
POLICY_DRIFT
TRUST_DRIFT
```

This helps maintainers understand why revalidation changed the result.

---

## Deprecation Strategy

Framework capabilities may become deprecated.

Candidates include:

* rules;
* profiles;
* validators;
* evidence schemas;
* report schemas;
* gate versions;
* configuration options.

Deprecation must remain explicit.

---

## Deprecation Requirements

Every meaningful deprecation should define:

* deprecated artifact;
* reason;
* replacement;
* migration guidance;
* warning period;
* retirement target.

Tooling should expose deprecation warnings before removal.

---

## Retirement

Retirement removes an artifact from active framework behavior.

Retirement must not remove the historical metadata needed to interpret old Compliance Results.

A retired profile may no longer be selectable for new evaluations but may remain readable for historical records.

---

## Framework Retirement

The framework itself is a foundational FamilyOS capability and is not expected to be retired casually.

If a successor framework ever replaces EPIC-PLUGIN-002, the migration must preserve:

* rule history;
* compliance result interpretation;
* certification evidence;
* plugin migration paths;
* governance continuity.

---

## Long-Term Rule Catalog

The Rule Catalog will grow over time.

Growth must remain controlled.

New rules should be introduced only when they represent meaningful, enforceable requirements.

A large rule count is not itself a sign of maturity.

Rule quality matters more than quantity.

---

## Rule Consolidation

Over time, overlapping or obsolete rules may require consolidation.

Consolidation must preserve historical traceability.

The framework should avoid rewriting multiple historical rules into one without explicit replacement mappings.

---

## Domain Evolution

Existing domains may gain new responsibilities as the platform evolves.

New domains should only be added when existing ownership models cannot represent the requirement cleanly.

Potential future domains include:

* privacy;
* observability;
* performance;
* accessibility;
* AI governance;
* data governance.

---

## Third-Party Ecosystem Readiness

Before broad third-party plugin adoption, the framework should reach sufficient maturity in:

* public rule documentation;
* stable profiles;
* developer tooling;
* sandboxed validation;
* evidence trust;
* compatibility policy;
* remediation quality.

External authors require predictable contracts.

---

## Public Compliance Contract

A mature third-party ecosystem requires a stable public compliance contract.

This contract should define:

* plugin requirements;
* supported APIs;
* validation commands;
* applicable profiles;
* rule references;
* release or publication requirements;
* certification options.

Hidden internal expectations must not become external compliance requirements.

---

## Framework Adoption Levels

FamilyOS may track adoption through levels such as:

```text
Level 0 — Documentation Only
Level 1 — Local Validation
Level 2 — CI Validation
Level 3 — Merge Enforcement
Level 4 — Release Enforcement
Level 5 — Certification Integration
Level 6 — Continuous Revalidation
```

These levels may help measure framework maturity.

---

## Initial Framework Baseline

The initial operational baseline should prioritize:

1. official plugin compliance;
2. stable Rule IDs;
3. compliance profiles;
4. local CLI validation;
5. CI integration;
6. structured findings;
7. JSON reporting;
8. release gate integration.

This baseline provides immediate value without requiring every future feature.

---

## Intermediate Maturity

Intermediate maturity may add:

* evidence reuse;
* incremental validation;
* artifact binding;
* trusted CI provenance;
* compliance drift analysis;
* stronger gate policies;
* certification eligibility.

---

## Advanced Maturity

Advanced maturity may include:

* attested evidence;
* signed compliance results;
* remote verification;
* registry integration;
* automated certification renewal;
* ecosystem analytics;
* continuous policy impact analysis.

These capabilities should remain compatible with the foundational architecture.

---

## Framework Evolution Decisions

Significant framework evolution should consider:

```text
Security
Architecture
Compatibility
Developer Experience
Migration Cost
Operational Complexity
Ecosystem Impact
```

The strongest technical solution is not always the best lifecycle decision if migration risk is disproportionate.

---

## Evolution Conservatism

Stable compliance contracts should evolve conservatively.

This means:

* avoiding unnecessary breaking changes;
* preferring explicit migration;
* preserving Rule IDs;
* documenting enforcement changes;
* providing compatibility windows when appropriate.

Experimental areas may evolve faster.

---

## Stable vs Experimental Features

Framework capabilities should distinguish stable and experimental features.

Experimental capabilities may include:

* new validators;
* new trust models;
* new certification interfaces.

Experimental features must not silently become mandatory stable policy.

---

## Feature Graduation

A conceptual graduation flow is:

```text
Experimental
    │
    ▼
Preview
    │
    ▼
Stable
```

Promotion should require sufficient testing, documentation, and governance review.

---

## Framework Configuration Evolution

Configuration schemas may evolve.

Changes must preserve:

* explicit defaults;
* validation;
* migration guidance;
* security constraints.

Configuration changes must never silently weaken mandatory compliance policy.

---

## Tooling Compatibility

CLI and CI integrations should declare supported framework versions.

When incompatibility exists, tooling should provide a clear error and upgrade guidance.

---

## Validator Compatibility

Validator versions may evolve independently.

The framework must preserve the distinction between:

* validator implementation version;
* rule semantics;
* evidence schema.

This allows implementation improvement without unnecessary rule churn.

---

## Certification Compatibility

Certification systems may accept only specific framework or profile versions.

A compliance result outside the accepted compatibility window may require revalidation.

This prevents obsolete compliance policy from satisfying current certification standards.

---

## Release Compatibility

Release workflows may similarly define minimum accepted framework versions.

Older local compliance results should not automatically authorize current releases.

---

## Framework Changelog

Every framework release should maintain a clear changelog.

The changelog should highlight:

* added rules;
* removed rules;
* deprecated rules;
* severity changes;
* profile changes;
* gate changes;
* schema changes;
* migration requirements.

---

## Revision History

The documentation set should maintain revision history describing significant conceptual changes to the framework.

This complements code-level version history.

---

## Lifecycle Documentation

Lifecycle state should be documented for:

* framework releases;
* rules;
* profiles;
* gates;
* schemas.

A developer should be able to determine whether a compliance artifact is current, deprecated, experimental, or retired.

---

## Framework Self-Compliance

As the framework matures, its own implementation should satisfy the same engineering standards it enforces.

This includes:

* testing;
* quality;
* documentation;
* security;
* architecture;
* release governance.

The compliance framework should not become an exception to FamilyOS engineering discipline.

---

## Framework Validation

Before each framework release, FamilyOS should validate:

* rule catalog integrity;
* profile integrity;
* gate integrity;
* schemas;
* validator tests;
* documentation consistency;
* migration documentation;
* backward compatibility.

---

## Framework Release Gates

The framework itself may eventually use dedicated release gates.

A conceptual flow is:

```text
Framework Changes
      │
      ▼
Policy Validation
      │
      ▼
Rule Tests
      │
      ▼
Impact Analysis
      │
      ▼
Documentation Validation
      │
      ▼
Framework Release
```

---

## Rollback Strategy

A framework release may require rollback if it introduces severe unintended behavior.

Rollback must preserve:

* results already produced;
* version traceability;
* rule history;
* migration records.

A rollback creates a new current state.

It does not erase history.

---

## Emergency Lifecycle Changes

Critical security or integrity issues may require emergency framework releases.

Emergency changes should still preserve:

* explicit version;
* changelog;
* ownership;
* rationale;
* affected rules;
* revalidation requirements.

Urgency must not eliminate traceability.

---

## Long-Term Maintenance

Long-term framework maintenance includes:

* reviewing stale rules;
* removing obsolete validators;
* updating migration guides;
* reviewing exceptions;
* monitoring performance;
* validating profile consistency;
* adapting to new platform architecture.

Compliance is a permanent engineering capability rather than a one-time project.

---

## Lifecycle Metrics

Framework lifecycle metrics may include:

* framework adoption level;
* active rules;
* deprecated rules;
* average rule age;
* exception count;
* migration duration;
* revalidation frequency;
* compliance drift rate;
* validator reliability;
* average validation duration.

Metrics inform evolution decisions.

They do not replace engineering judgment.

---

## Framework Health

A healthy framework should demonstrate:

* low ambiguity;
* high validator reliability;
* understandable findings;
* controlled rule growth;
* manageable migration cost;
* low exception debt;
* predictable release behavior.

Frequent emergency exceptions may indicate design problems.

---

## Lifecycle Anti-Patterns

The framework must avoid several lifecycle anti-patterns.

### Permanent Experimental State

Do not leave critical compliance behavior indefinitely experimental.

### Silent Breaking Changes

Do not strengthen stable policy without versioning and migration.

### Historical Rewrite

Do not alter previous compliance results to match current policy.

### Endless Compatibility

Do not preserve obsolete framework versions indefinitely without clear need.

### Migration Without Tooling

Do not introduce broad breaking changes without practical remediation guidance.

### Version Without Meaning

Do not change framework versions without communicating semantic impact.

### Stale Certification Evidence

Do not let obsolete compliance contexts silently satisfy current certification requirements.

---

## Framework Lifecycle Invariants

The Framework Lifecycle establishes the following invariants:

1. The compliance framework has an explicit version.
2. Historical Compliance Results preserve their original framework context.
3. Stable compliance policy does not change silently.
4. Breaking framework changes require migration guidance.
5. New broad requirements may use progressive adoption.
6. Critical requirements may require immediate enforcement.
7. Compatibility windows are explicit and temporary.
8. Revalidation produces new immutable results.
9. Historical compliance is not rewritten by current policy.
10. Deprecated framework artifacts remain interpretable.
11. Retired rules and profiles preserve historical metadata.
12. Third-party adoption requires stable public contracts.
13. Tooling must reject unsupported framework versions clearly.
14. Certification may require current framework versions.
15. Framework changes may trigger scoped or ecosystem-wide revalidation.
16. Framework evolution remains governed.
17. Compliance drift is expected and must be explainable.
18. Experimental features do not silently become mandatory.
19. Emergency changes remain traceable.
20. The framework itself follows FamilyOS engineering quality standards.

---

## Reference Lifecycle

The complete framework evolution model is:

```text
Architecture Defined
        │
        ▼
Initial Implementation
        │
        ▼
Official Plugin Pilot
        │
        ▼
Local Adoption
        │
        ▼
CI Adoption
        │
        ▼

        │
        ▼
Third-Party Ecosystem
        │
        ▼
Continuous Revalidation
        │
        ▼
Long-Term Evolution
```

Each stage strengthens plugin assurance while preserving migration paths.

---

## Lifecycle Summary

The Plugin Compliance Framework must evolve as a stable platform contract rather than as a collection of ad hoc checks.

Its lifecycle can be summarized as:

```text
Definition
    +
Implementation
    +
Adoption
    +
Enforcement
    +
Migration
    +
Revalidation
    +
Governance
    =
Sustainable Compliance Framework
```

This lifecycle allows FamilyOS to increase plugin assurance without destabilizing its ecosystem.

---

## Final Lifecycle Principle

The governing lifecycle principle of EPIC-PLUGIN-002 is:

> Compliance maturity is achieved not by freezing requirements, but by making their evolution predictable.

FamilyOS must therefore evolve the Plugin Compliance Framework through explicit versions, migration paths, compatibility policies, revalidation, and historical traceability so that both the platform and its plugin ecosystem can continue to mature safely.
