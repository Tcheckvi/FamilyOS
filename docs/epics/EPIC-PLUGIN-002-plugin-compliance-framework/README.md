# Plugin Compliance Framework

## EPIC-PLUGIN-002

## Purpose

The Plugin Compliance Framework defines how FamilyOS evaluates whether plugins conform to the architectural, engineering, security, testing, quality, documentation, compatibility, lifecycle, and governance requirements of the platform.

The framework establishes a common compliance language based on:

* governed compliance rules;
* compliance profiles;
* deterministic validation;
* structured evidence;
* actionable findings;
* explicit severity;
* reproducible compliance results;
* lifecycle gates;
* certification eligibility.

The framework is designed to support built-in, official, first-party, and future third-party plugins.

---

## Scope

EPIC-PLUGIN-002 covers:

* plugin compliance architecture;
* compliance domains;
* rule modeling;
* profile modeling;
* validation orchestration;
* evidence modeling;
* findings and severity;
* reporting;
* automation;
* CI integration;
* lifecycle gates;
* certification integration;
* governance;
* security and trust;
* framework lifecycle;
* roadmap;
* validation;
* release.

The framework defines the compliance architecture and governance model.

Implementation maturity continues through the roadmap defined by this EPIC.

---

## Core Principle

The foundational principle of EPIC-PLUGIN-002 is:

> A FamilyOS plugin is not compliant because it works. It is compliant because its conformance to the platform contract can be demonstrated.

---

## Framework Model

The framework follows this conceptual model:

```text

        │
        ▼
Compliance Rules
        │
        ▼
Compliance Profiles

        │
        ▼

```

## Compliance Domains

The initial compliance domains are:

```text
Identity
Metadata
Structure
Architecture
Capabilities
Contributions
Dependencies
Configuration
Security
Testing
Quality
Documentation
Compatibility
Lifecycle
Governance
```

Every compliance rule has one primary domain.

---

## Rule Outcomes

The canonical rule outcome baseline is:

```text
PASS
FAIL
NOT_APPLICABLE
NOT_EVALUATED
ERROR
```

Rule outcome describes evaluation state.

It is separate from severity.

---

## Severity

The baseline severity model is:

```text
INFO
WARNING
ERROR
CRITICAL
```

Severity expresses the consequence of a finding.

---

## Compliance Status

The canonical overall compliance states are:

```text
COMPLIANT
NON_COMPLIANT
INCOMPLETE
ERROR
```

Overall compliance status is derived from rule outcomes, policy, evidence completeness, mandatory rules, and approved exceptions.

---

## Compliance Profiles

The architecture supports profiles such as:

```text
development
experimental
built-in
official
third-party
release
certification
```

Profiles compose existing rules.

They never redefine the semantic meaning of those rules.

---

## Compliance and Certification

Compliance and certification are intentionally separate.

The relationship is:

```text
Compliance
    │
    ▼
Certification Eligibility
    │
    ▼
Certification Gate
    │
    ▼
Certification Governance
    │
    ▼
Certification Decision
```

A compliant plugin is not automatically certified.

---

## Relationships

EPIC-PLUGIN-002 builds on existing FamilyOS engineering foundations.

Primary relationships include:

```text
Engineering Foundation
        │
        ├── Documentation Framework
        ├── Testing Framework
        ├── Quality Framework
        ├── Security Architecture
        ├── Runtime Architecture
        ├── Configuration Architecture
        ├── Governance Architecture
        │
        ▼
Plugin Architecture
        │
        ▼
Plugin Compliance Framework
        │
        ▼
Build / Release / Certification
```

The compliance framework consumes existing authoritative requirements rather than duplicating them.

---

## Key References

Important references include:

* EPIC-ENG-001 — Engineering Foundation;
* EPIC-DOC-001 — Documentation Framework;
* EPIC-TST-001 — Testing Framework;
* EPIC-QLT-001 — Quality Framework;
* ADR-0007 — Official Plugins Architecture;
* ADR-0013 — Official Plugin Implementation Strategy;
* ADR-0008 — Specification-Driven Platform;
* ADR-0009 — Normative Validation Architecture;
* ADR-0010 — Official-Plugin Domain Maturity Review;
* ADR-0011 — Official-Plugin Certification Process;
* FamilyOS Security Architecture;
* FamilyOS Runtime Architecture;
* FamilyOS Configuration Architecture;
* FamilyOS Governance Architecture;
* official plugin RFCs.

Where reference identifiers are ambiguous or duplicated in the repository, the authoritative source should be resolved before compliance enforcement depends on it.

---

## Governance

The Plugin Compliance Framework is governed as part of the FamilyOS Engineering Platform.

Changes to compliance semantics must be:

* explicit;
* reviewed;
* versioned;
* traceable;
* tested;
* documented;
* migration-aware.

Compliance requirements must never emerge accidentally from validator implementation behavior.

---

## Versioning

Framework releases must have explicit versions.

A compliance result is meaningful only in context:

```text
Plugin Version
+
Platform Version
+
Compliance Framework Version
+
Compliance Profile Version
=
Compliance Context
```

Historical results remain associated with their original context.

---

## Validation

Framework validation includes:

* documentation completeness;
* architecture review;
* rule validation;
* profile validation;
* validator tests;
* evidence tests;
* finding tests;
* reporting tests;
* gate tests;
* governance tests;
* security tests;
* official plugin pilot;
* repository quality gates.

Where implementation exists, FamilyOS engineering validation is expected to include:

```text
Ruff
MyPy
Pytest
```

according to repository policy.

---

## Initial Implementation Strategy

The recommended first implementation slice is intentionally limited:

```text
One Official Plugin
        +
One Official Compliance Profile
        +
10–20 Deterministic Rules
        +
Core Validation Engine
        +
Human-Readable Report
        +
JSON Report
```

This allows the architecture to be proven before the rule catalog and enforcement scope expand.

---

The recommended progression is:

```text

```

## Framework Status

EPIC-PLUGIN-002 currently defines the normative architecture and governance model for the Plugin Compliance Framework.

Documentation completion establishes the framework-definition baseline.

It does not imply that every capability described in the roadmap has already been implemented.

Operational maturity must be demonstrated through the validation and roadmap criteria defined by this EPIC.

---

## Final Principle

The Plugin Compliance Framework exists to establish one durable rule for the FamilyOS plugin ecosystem:

> Extensibility becomes sustainable when conformance can be demonstrated consistently, automatically, transparently, and under governed platform contracts.

EPIC-PLUGIN-002 provides the architecture required to make that principle enforceable across the long-term evolution of FamilyOS.
