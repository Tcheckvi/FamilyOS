# Plugin Compliance Framework

## 23 Checklist

### Introduction

This checklist provides the final completion criteria for EPIC-PLUGIN-002 — Plugin Compliance Framework.

It is intended to verify that the framework definition is complete, internally coherent, structurally valid, governance-ready, and prepared for implementation.

The checklist distinguishes between:

* documentation completion;
* architecture completion;
* governance completion;
* implementation readiness;
* operational readiness.

A completed documentation EPIC does not imply that every future roadmap capability is already implemented.

---

## Completion Principle

The governing principle is:

> EPIC-PLUGIN-002 is complete as a framework definition when its contracts, architecture, governance, lifecycle, validation model, and implementation path are explicit and internally consistent.

Operational maturity continues through the implementation roadmap.

---

## Core EPIC Files

Verify that all primary framework documents exist:

```text
[ ] 00-EPIC.md
[ ] 01-Context.md

```

---

## File Integrity

Verify:

```text
[ ] All required files exist
[ ] No required file is empty
[ ] Markdown files are readable
[ ] No accidental binary content exists
[ ] No incomplete placeholder sections remain
[ ] No temporary drafting markers remain
[ ] No broken code fences remain
```

---

## Naming Validation

Verify:

```text
[ ] EPIC identifier is consistently EPIC-PLUGIN-002
[ ] Framework name is consistently Plugin Compliance Framework
[ ] Directory name matches repository conventions
[ ] Document filenames follow FamilyOS naming conventions
[ ] Rule terminology is consistent across documents
```

---

## Structural Consistency

Verify that the documentation progresses logically through:

```text
Context
Vision
Principles
Architecture
Domains
Rules
Profiles
Validation
Evidence
Findings
Reporting
Automation
Gates
Certification
Governance
Security
Lifecycle
Roadmap
References
Validation
Summary
Release
Checklist
```

No major architectural concept should depend on a concept that is undefined elsewhere.

---

## Terminology

Verify consistent use of:

```text
[ ] Compliance Rule
[ ] Compliance Profile
[ ] Validator
[ ] Validation Context
[ ] Evidence
[ ] Rule Outcome
[ ] Compliance Finding
[ ] Severity
[ ] Compliance Result
[ ] Compliance Status
[ ] Compliance Gate
[ ] Certification Eligibility
[ ] Certification
```

---

## Semantic Boundaries

Verify that the framework consistently preserves:

```text
[ ] Rule != Finding
[ ] Rule Outcome != Severity
[ ] Finding Severity != Compliance Status
[ ] Compliance != Certification
[ ] Suppression != Exception
[ ] Validator Error != Plugin Non-Compliance
[ ] Missing Evidence != PASS
[ ] Certification Eligibility != Certification
```

These distinctions are mandatory.

---

## Compliance Status Model

Verify that the canonical overall status model is consistently defined as:

```text
[ ] COMPLIANT
[ ] NON_COMPLIANT
[ ] INCOMPLETE
[ ] ERROR
```

No conflicting status vocabulary should exist in stable framework semantics.

---

## Rule Outcome Model

Verify that rule evaluation uses the canonical baseline:

```text
[ ] PASS
[ ] FAIL
[ ] NOT_APPLICABLE
[ ] NOT_EVALUATED
[ ] ERROR
```

---

## Severity Model

Verify the severity hierarchy:

```text
[ ] INFO
[ ] WARNING
[ ] ERROR
[ ] CRITICAL
```

Verify that severity remains independent from rule outcome.

---

## Compliance Domains

Verify that the initial domain baseline includes:

```text
[ ] Identity
[ ] Metadata
[ ] Structure
[ ] Architecture
[ ] Capabilities
[ ] Contributions
[ ] Dependencies
[ ] Configuration
[ ] Security
[ ] Testing
[ ] Quality
[ ] Documentation
[ ] Compatibility
[ ] Lifecycle
[ ] Governance
```

---

## Rule Model

Verify that every production rule is expected to define:

```text

[ ] Requirement
[ ] Rationale
[ ] Severity
[ ] Applicability
[ ] Validation strategy
[ ] Evidence requirements

```

---

## Rule Identity

Verify:

```text
[ ] Rule IDs are globally unique
[ ] Rule IDs remain stable after publication
[ ] Materially changed requirements preserve historical traceability
[ ] Deprecated rules can identify replacements
[ ] Retired rules remain historically interpretable
```

---

## Rule Lifecycle

Verify the baseline lifecycle:

```text
[ ] DRAFT
[ ] ACTIVE
[ ] DEPRECATED
[ ] RETIRED
```

Verify that activation and retirement require explicit governance.

---

## Rule Governance

Verify:

```text
[ ] Every active rule has an owner
[ ] Every rule has an authoritative source
[ ] Rule activation is governed
[ ] Severity changes are governed
[ ] Applicability changes are governed
[ ] Mandatory status is governed
[ ] Exception policy is explicit
[ ] Breaking changes require migration guidance
```

---

## Compliance Profiles

Verify expected profile concepts:

```text
[ ] development
[ ] experimental
[ ] built-in
[ ] official
[ ] third-party
[ ] release
[ ] certification
```

Not every profile must be implemented immediately, but the model must support them.

---

## Profile Semantics

Verify:

```text
[ ] Profiles compose rules
[ ] Profiles do not redefine rule meaning
[ ] Profiles are versioned
[ ] Profile resolution is deterministic
[ ] Mandatory rules cannot be silently excluded

[ ] Rule Resolution
[ ] Applicability Evaluation
[ ] Rule Dependency Graph
[ ] Validation Planning
[ ] Validator Execution

[ ] Validators do not declare overall compliance
[ ] Validator execution status is distinct from rule outcome
[ ] Validator failures are represented explicitly
[ ] Validators are resolved through a governed registry
```

---

## Determinism

Verify:

```text
[ ] Equivalent contexts produce equivalent semantic results
[ ] Parallel execution does not change compliance meaning

[ ] Producer
[ ] Producer version
[ ] Plugin association
[ ] Source revision
[ ] Platform context
[ ] Framework context
[ ] Scope
[ ] Payload
[ ] Provenance
[ ] Freshness
[ ] Trust
[ ] Integrity
```

---

## Evidence Trust

Verify the architecture can distinguish evidence trust levels conceptually such as:

```text
[ ] UNVERIFIED
[ ] LOCAL
[ ] TRUSTED
[ ] ATTESTED
```

Exact implementation names may evolve, but stronger profiles must be able to require stronger provenance.

---

## Evidence Reuse

Verify:

```text
[ ] Evidence may be reused when compatible
[ ] Evidence reuse checks freshness
[ ] Evidence reuse checks provenance
[ ] Evidence reuse checks scope
[ ] Evidence reuse checks context
[ ] Stale evidence cannot silently satisfy current rules
```

---

## Evidence Integrity

Verify:

```text
[ ] Finalized evidence is immutable
[ ] Artifact-bound evidence can identify the artifact
[ ] Corrupted evidence is rejected

[ ] Secrets are not copied into ordinary evidence payloads
```

---

## Findings

Verify each actionable finding may expose:

```text

[ ] Domain
[ ] Category
[ ] Severity
[ ] Title
[ ] Message
[ ] Evidence references
[ ] Location
[ ] Remediation
[ ] Suppression state
[ ] Exception state
```

---

## Finding Categories

Verify the conceptual categories remain clear:

```text
[ ] VIOLATION
[ ] INCOMPLETE
[ ] VALIDATION_ERROR
[ ] GOVERNANCE
[ ] ADVISORY
```

The final implementation vocabulary may be refined, but categories must remain semantically distinct.

---

## Remediation

Verify:

```text
[ ] Failed rules provide actionable remediation
[ ] Remediation points to supported mechanisms
[ ] Remediation does not rely on vague instructions
[ ] Migration references can be included where relevant
```

---

## Suppressions

Verify:

```text
[ ] Suppressions remain visible
[ ] Suppressions do not erase rule outcomes
[ ] Suppressions are scoped
[ ] Suppressions may expire
[ ] Suppression authority can be governed
[ ] Critical findings cannot be silently hidden
```

---

## Exceptions

Verify:

```text
[ ] Exceptions are explicit
[ ] Exceptions are scoped
[ ] Exceptions have justification
[ ] Exceptions have authority
[ ] Exceptions may expire
[ ] Non-exemptible rules are supported
[ ] Exceptions never convert FAIL into ordinary PASS
```

---

## Reporting

Verify that all reports derive from the canonical Compliance Result.

Supported reporting concepts should include:

```text
[ ] Human-readable developer report

[ ] Renderers do not recompute compliance
```

---

## Automation

Verify integration architecture exists for:

```text
[ ] Local development
[ ] CLI
[ ] CI
[ ] Pull requests
[ ] Merge gates
[ ] Build
[ ] Release
[ ] Certification readiness
[ ] Future continuous revalidation
```

---

## Local and CI Consistency

Verify:

```text
[ ] Local and CI use the same rule semantics
[ ] Local and CI use the same decision model
[ ] Profile selection is explicit
[ ] CI does not silently downgrade profiles
[ ] CI can consume existing engineering evidence
```

---

## Existing Toolchain Integration

Verify the roadmap supports reuse of:

```text
[ ] Ruff
[ ] MyPy
[ ] Pytest
```

where those tools already produce authoritative FamilyOS engineering evidence.

---

## Compliance Gates

Verify conceptual gate support for:

```text
[ ] Development Gate
[ ] Merge Gate
[ ] Build Gate
[ ] Release Gate
[ ] Certification Gate
```

Not every gate must exist in the first implementation.

---

## Gate Semantics

Verify:

```text
[ ] Gates consume Compliance Results
[ ] Gates do not create new compliance rules
[ ] Gate policies are explicit
[ ] Strong gates normally require COMPLIANT
[ ] NON_COMPLIANT blocks strong gates
[ ] INCOMPLETE blocks strong gates
[ ] ERROR blocks strong gates
[ ] Gate profile downgrade is prohibited
```

---

## Gate Decisions

Verify Gate Decisions can preserve:

```text
[ ] Gate ID
[ ] Gate version
[ ] Evaluation ID
[ ] Compliance status
[ ] Decision
[ ] Blocking reasons
[ ] Exceptions
[ ] Timestamp
```

---

## Certification Boundary

Verify:

```text
[ ] Compliance determines technical conformance
[ ] Certification remains a separate governance capability
[ ] Certification eligibility is derived from compliance

[ ] Exception visibility
[ ] Suppression visibility
[ ] Compliance package
```

---

## Artifact Binding

Verify strong lifecycle contexts can bind:

```text
Plugin Artifact

Compliance Evaluation
```

This prevents compliance evidence from being reused for the wrong artifact.

---

## Security and Trust

Verify the framework explicitly assumes:

```text
[ ] Evaluated plugins are not automatically trusted
[ ] Plugin claims require validation
[ ] Rule Catalog belongs to trusted policy
[ ] Profile Registry belongs to trusted policy
[ ] Validator Registry is governed
[ ] Evidence trust is derived
[ ] Plugin-local configuration cannot weaken mandatory policy
```

---

## Runtime Isolation

Verify the architecture supports future isolated execution for untrusted plugins, including concepts such as:

```text
[ ] Timeouts
[ ] Filesystem restrictions
[ ] Network restrictions
[ ] Credential isolation
[ ] Resource limits
```

---

## Anti-Tampering

Verify the framework addresses:

```text
[ ] Rule tampering
[ ] Profile tampering
[ ] Validator replacement
[ ] Evidence forgery
[ ] Artifact substitution
[ ] Unauthorized exception
[ ] Result modification
```

---

## Secret Handling

Verify:

```text
[ ] Secrets are never copied into normal reports
[ ] Secret findings identify location without exposing value
[ ] Evidence collection follows data minimization
```

---

```

---

## Deprecation

Verify support for deprecation of:

```text
[ ] Rules
[ ] Profiles
[ ] Validators
[ ] Schemas
[ ] Gates
[ ] Configuration options
```

Deprecated artifacts must remain historically interpretable.

---

## Migration

Verify:

```text
[ ] Rule migration can identify replacements
[ ] Profile migration can expose new requirements
[ ] Breaking changes include remediation guidance

[ ] Critical changes may be enforced immediately when justified
```

---

## Revalidation

Verify:

```text
[ ] New framework versions can trigger revalidation
[ ] Platform changes can trigger revalidation
[ ] Dependency changes can trigger revalidation

```text
[ ] One official plugin pilot
[ ] One official profile
[ ] Approximately 10–20 deterministic rules
[ ] Core validation engine
[ ] Human-readable report
[ ] JSON report
```

The first implementation should prove semantics rather than maximize rule count.

---

## Official Plugin Pilot

Verify the framework intends to validate representative official plugins.

Potential pilot coverage includes:

```text
[ ] Security
[ ] Health
[ ] Finance
[ ] Education
[ ] Documents
[ ] Communication
```

The final pilot set may evolve.

---

## Pilot Quality

Verify:

```text
[ ] Rules are tested against real plugins
[ ] False positives are reviewed
[ ] Findings are actionable
[ ] Performance is measured
[ ] Blocking enforcement follows sufficient pilot confidence
```

---

## Third-Party Readiness

Before external plugin adoption, verify:

```text
[ ] Public compliance contract is stable
[ ] Public rule reference exists
[ ] Third-party profile exists
[ ] Remediation guidance is understandable
[ ] Runtime validation can be isolated
[ ] Internal undocumented assumptions are not enforced
```

---

## References

Verify the framework references authoritative FamilyOS foundations, including:

[ ] Official Plugin RFCs
```

---

## Normative Traceability

Verify:

```text
[ ] Compliance rules can reference authoritative sources
[ ] Validators do not become source authority
[ ] Conflicting source requirements require governance resolution
[ ] Compliance does not silently invent parallel architecture
```

---

## Framework Validation

Verify readiness checks include:

```text
[ ] Documentation validation
[ ] Architecture review
[ ] Rule schema validation
[ ] Profile validation
[ ] Rule tests
[ ] Engine tests
[ ] Evidence tests
[ ] Findings tests
[ ] Reporting tests
[ ] Gate tests
[ ] Governance tests
[ ] Security tests
[ ] Official plugin pilot
[ ] Repository quality gates
```

---

## Engineering Quality

Where implementation exists, verify:

```text
[ ] Ruff passes
[ ] MyPy passes
[ ] Pytest passes
```

according to current FamilyOS repository policy.

---

## Governance Files

Before final EPIC closure, verify creation and completion of:

```text
[ ] README.md
[ ] EPIC.yaml
[ ] MANIFEST.md
[ ] VALIDATION.md
[ ] CHANGELOG.md
[ ] Revision-History.md
```

Additional repository-standard governance files may be added if required.

---

## README

Verify README includes:

```text
[ ] Purpose
[ ] Scope
[ ] Document index
[ ] Framework relationships
[ ] Governance
[ ] Validation
[ ] Versioning
[ ] Status
```

---

## EPIC Metadata

Verify `EPIC.yaml` includes required repository metadata such as:

```text
[ ] EPIC ID
[ ] Title
[ ] Status
[ ] Version
[ ] Owner or governance context where required
[ ] Deliverables
[ ] Dependencies
```

The exact schema must follow current repository conventions.

---

## Manifest

Verify `MANIFEST.md` describes:

```text
[ ] Normative hierarchy
[ ] Deliverable inventory
[ ] Completeness expectations
[ ] Ownership
[ ] Status
```

---

## Validation Record

Verify `VALIDATION.md` records:

```text
[ ] Documentation checks
[ ] File completeness
[ ] Structural checks
[ ] Repository quality checks where applicable
[ ] Final validation status
```

---

## Changelog

Verify `CHANGELOG.md` records the initial framework baseline and future version evolution.

---

## Revision History

Verify `Revision-History.md` records significant normative documentation changes.

---

## Repository Check

Before commit, run repository-level inspection such as:

```text
tree docs/epics/EPIC-PLUGIN-002-plugin-compliance-framework
```

and:

```text
git status --short
```

No required document should be missing.

---

## Empty File Check

Use an appropriate repository command to identify empty files before finalization.

The exact command may vary by environment.

Expected result:

```text
0 required empty files
```

---

## Heading Review

Review primary headings across the EPIC to detect:

* duplicate accidental titles;
* malformed document numbering;
* inconsistent terminology;
* missing final sections.

---

## Reference Review

Review references for:

* outdated document names;
* duplicated ADR identifiers;
* ambiguous authority;
* missing framework dependencies.

Any reference ambiguity should be resolved before the framework becomes normative.

---

## Duplication Review

Because the EPIC is intentionally comprehensive, perform a final duplication review.

The objective is not to eliminate all repetition.

Normative documents may intentionally restate critical invariants.

The review should eliminate only:

* contradictory duplication;
* accidental copy duplication;
* sections with no unique purpose.

---

## Architecture Review

Before closure, verify that all major concepts fit the reference architecture:

```text
Requirements
    │
    ▼
Rules
    │
    ▼
Profiles
    │
    ▼
Validation Engine
    │
    ▼
Evidence
    │
    ▼
Rule Outcomes
    │
    ▼
Findings
    │
    ▼
Compliance Result
    │
    ▼
Gates
    │
    ▼
Release / Certification
```

---

## Trust Review

Verify the final architecture answers:

```text
Who defines compliance policy?
Who evaluates plugins?
Which evidence is trusted?
Can plugins alter their own evaluation?
How are exceptions approved?
How are artifacts identified?
How are certification decisions separated?
```

All answers should be explicit.

---

## Implementation Readiness

EPIC-PLUGIN-002 is implementation-ready when:

```text
[ ] Core vocabulary is stable
[ ] Architecture is explicit
[ ] Rule model is explicit
[ ] Profile model is explicit
[ ] Validator contract is explicit
[ ] Evidence semantics are explicit
[ ] Finding semantics are explicit
[ ] Status derivation is explicit
[ ] Gate semantics are explicit
[ ] Certification boundary is explicit
[ ] Governance model is explicit
[ ] Security model is explicit
[ ] Roadmap is explicit
```

---

## Documentation Completion Criteria

The EPIC documentation is complete when:

1. all required framework documents exist;
2. governance files are complete;
3. terminology is consistent;
4. architecture is internally coherent;
5. normative references are traceable;
6. validation requirements are explicit;
7. roadmap and release expectations are clear;
8. no major unresolved conceptual ambiguity remains.

---

## Operational Readiness Criteria

Operational readiness is a later implementation milestone.

It requires:

```text
[ ] Core engine implemented
[ ] Initial Rule Catalog implemented
[ ] Official profile implemented
[ ] Validators implemented
[ ] Findings operational
[ ] JSON reporting operational
[ ] CLI operational
[ ] CI operational
[ ] Official plugin pilot complete
[ ] Blocking behavior tested
```

This distinction prevents documentation completion from being mistaken for implementation completion.

---

## Release-Enforced Readiness

Release enforcement requires additional maturity:

```text
[ ] Stable official compliance profile
[ ] Reliable CI validation
[ ] Trusted evidence
[ ] Artifact binding
[ ] Release Gate
[ ] Migration process
[ ] Low false-positive rate
```

---

## Certification Readiness

Certification integration requires:

```text
[ ] Certification profile
[ ] Certification eligibility
[ ] Certification evidence package
[ ] Strong evidence provenance
[ ] Exact artifact binding
[ ] Certification Gate
[ ] Separate certification governance
```

---

## Third-Party Readiness

Third-party readiness requires:

```text
[ ] Stable public contracts
[ ] Public rule documentation
[ ] Third-party profile
[ ] Secure validation environment
[ ] Trust-aware evidence
[ ] Strong remediation guidance
[ ] Compatibility policy
```

---

## Final Review

Before marking EPIC-PLUGIN-002 complete, review the entire framework against three questions.

### Question 1

Can a developer understand exactly what FamilyOS means by plugin compliance?

Expected answer:

```text
Yes
```

### Question 2

Can an implementation team build the compliance engine without inventing missing foundational semantics?

Expected answer:

```text
Yes
```

### Question 3

Can governance evolve compliance requirements without destroying historical traceability?

Expected answer:

```text
Yes
```

If any answer is uncertain, the framework requires additional refinement.

## Final Completion Checklist

The final framework-definition checklist is:

```text
[ ] Scope defined
[ ] Context defined
[ ] Vision defined
[ ] Principles defined
[ ] Architecture defined
[ ] Domains defined
[ ] Rule Model defined
[ ] Profiles defined
[ ] Validation Engine defined
[ ] Evidence Model defined
[ ] Findings Model defined

[ ] Certification boundary defined
[ ] Governance defined
[ ] Trust model defined
[ ] Framework lifecycle defined
[ ] Roadmap defined

```

---

## Final Checklist Principle

The governing principle of this checklist is:

> The Plugin Compliance Framework is ready to guide implementation only when its own expectations are complete, explicit, and verifiable.

EPIC-PLUGIN-002 should therefore be closed as a framework-definition milestone only after its documentation, governance artifacts, references, validation criteria, and implementation boundaries have all been reviewed as one coherent system.
