# Plugin Compliance Framework

## 04 Compliance Architecture

### Introduction

The Compliance Architecture defines the structural model through which FamilyOS evaluates plugin conformance.

It transforms the principles established by EPIC-PLUGIN-002 into a coherent architecture composed of policies, rules, profiles, validators, evidence, findings, results, and reports.

The architecture must support both local developer workflows and automated engineering pipelines while preserving one authoritative interpretation of plugin compliance.

The fundamental processing model is:

```text
Plugin
   │
   ▼
Compliance Profile
   │
   ▼
Applicable Rules
   │
   ▼
Validators
   │
   ▼
Evidence
   │
   ▼
Findings
   │
   ▼
Compliance Result
   │
   ▼
Compliance Report
```

---

## Architectural Objectives

The Compliance Architecture must provide:

* deterministic validation;
* explicit rule ownership;
* rule composition;
* profile-based applicability;
* reusable validation mechanisms;
* normalized evidence;
* structured findings;
* derived compliance decisions;
* machine-readable results;
* human-readable reporting;
* version traceability;
* lifecycle-aware validation;
* certification integration;
* extensibility without policy fragmentation.

The architecture must remain independent from individual plugin implementations.

---

## Architectural Boundaries

The compliance system operates between platform requirements and plugin lifecycle consumers.

Conceptually:

│ CLI · CI · Build · Release · Certification   │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The compliance layer coordinates requirements without replacing their authoritative source frameworks.

---

## Core Architecture

The core architecture consists of eight primary components:

```text
Compliance Policy
        │
        ▼
Rule Catalog
        │
        ▼
Compliance Profiles
        │
        ▼
Validation Engine
        │
        ▼
Evidence Model
        │
        ▼
Finding Model
        │
        ▼
Compliance Result
        │
        ▼
Reporting
```

Each component owns a distinct responsibility.

---

## Compliance Policy

Compliance Policy defines the governance context in which rules are interpreted.

Policy determines:

* rule ownership;
* rule lifecycle;
* severity semantics;
* profile composition;
* mandatory requirements;
* exception rules;
* suppression rules;
* compatibility expectations;
* decision semantics.

Policy must remain separate from individual validator implementations.

A validator determines whether a requirement is satisfied.

Policy determines what that result means for compliance.

---

## Rule Catalog

The Rule Catalog is the authoritative registry of compliance requirements.

Every rule must have a stable identity and structured metadata.

A conceptual rule definition includes:

```text
ComplianceRule
├── id
├── domain
├── title
├── description
├── requirement
├── severity
├── applicability
├── validator
├── evidence_requirements
├── remediation
├── introduced_version
├── deprecated_version
└── replacement_rule
```

The exact implementation representation may evolve.

The architectural requirement is that rules remain identifiable, traceable, and machine-interpretable.

---

## Rule Identity

Rule identifiers must be globally unambiguous within the compliance framework.

A conceptual namespace may use domain-oriented identifiers:

```text
PLUGIN-ID-001
PLUGIN-META-001
PLUGIN-STRUCT-001
PLUGIN-ARCH-001
PLUGIN-CAP-001
PLUGIN-CONTRIB-001
PLUGIN-DEP-001
PLUGIN-CONF-001
PLUGIN-SEC-001
PLUGIN-TEST-001
PLUGIN-QLT-001
PLUGIN-DOC-001
PLUGIN-COMPAT-001
PLUGIN-LIFE-001
PLUGIN-GOV-001
```

The final identifier grammar belongs to the detailed rule specification.

Once published, identifiers must remain stable.

---

## Rule Domains

Rules are grouped into compliance domains.

The initial architecture recognizes:

```text
identity
metadata
structure
architecture
capabilities
contributions
dependencies
configuration
security
testing
quality
documentation
compatibility
lifecycle
governance
```

Domains provide organizational boundaries but do not require isolated execution.

A validator may collect evidence relevant to multiple domains while each rule retains one primary ownership domain.

---

## Compliance Profiles

A Compliance Profile defines the set of rules applicable to a specific validation context.

Profiles may be defined for:

* development plugins;
* built-in plugins;
* official plugins;
* third-party plugins;
* experimental plugins;
* release candidates;
* certification candidates.

A conceptual profile contains:

```text
ComplianceProfile
├── id
├── version
├── description
├── plugin_classifications
├── included_rules
├── excluded_rules
├── mandatory_rules
├── severity_policy
└── certification_target
```

Profiles compose rules.

They must not duplicate rule definitions.

---

## Profile Resolution

Before validation begins, the framework resolves the active compliance profile.

Conceptually:

```text
Plugin Metadata
      │
      ▼
Classification
      │
      ▼
Validation Context
      │
      ▼
Profile Resolver
      │
      ▼
Compliance Profile
      │
      ▼
Applicable Rules
```

Profile resolution must itself be deterministic.

A plugin must not silently choose a weaker profile than the context requires.

---

## Mandatory Rules

Some rules may be mandatory across multiple or all profiles.

Examples may include requirements protecting:

* plugin identity integrity;
* runtime safety;
* critical architecture boundaries;
* security boundaries;
* manifest validity.

Mandatory rules cannot be bypassed through ordinary profile configuration.

Any exception to a mandatory rule requires explicit governance.

---

## Validation Engine

The Validation Engine coordinates compliance execution.

Its responsibilities include:

* receiving the plugin target;
* resolving validation context;
* loading the compliance profile;
* resolving applicable rules;
* selecting validators;
* collecting evidence;
* evaluating rule outcomes;
* generating findings;
* deriving the compliance result;
* producing structured output.

Conceptually:

```text
                Plugin
                  │
                  ▼
          Validation Context
                  │
                  ▼
           Profile Resolver
                  │
                  ▼
            Applicable Rules
                  │
                  ▼
            Validator Planner
                  │
                  ▼
             Validators
                  │
                  ▼
              Evidence
                  │
                  ▼
           Rule Evaluation
                  │
                  ▼
              Findings
                  │
                  ▼
          Compliance Decision
```

---

## Validation Context

Every validation execution must have an explicit context.

A conceptual validation context includes:

```text
ValidationContext
├── plugin
├── plugin_version
├── plugin_classification
├── platform_version
├── framework_version
├── profile
├── environment
├── execution_mode
└── configuration
```

The context ensures that compliance results remain reproducible and interpretable.

---

## Validator Architecture

Validators implement deterministic validation mechanisms.

A validator should have one clearly defined responsibility.

Examples include:

* metadata schema validator;
* manifest validator;
* structure validator;
* dependency validator;
* capability validator;
* contribution validator;
* architecture validator;
* documentation validator;
* compatibility validator;
* lifecycle validator.

Validators should not independently decide overall plugin compliance.

They produce evidence and rule outcomes.

The compliance engine derives the final decision.

---

## Validator Contract

Validators should conform to a common execution contract.

Conceptually:

```text
Validator
   │
   ├── receives ValidationContext
   │
   ├── evaluates relevant input
   │
   ├── produces Evidence
   │
   └── reports ValidationOutcome
```

A validator must distinguish between:

* successful evaluation;
* requirement violation;
* not applicable;
* unavailable evidence;
* execution error.

This prevents infrastructure failures from being confused with plugin non-compliance.

---

## Validator Registry

The framework should maintain a registry of available validators.

Conceptually:

```text
ValidatorRegistry
├── metadata
├── structure
├── architecture
├── capabilities
├── contributions
├── dependencies
├── security
├── testing
├── quality
├── documentation
├── compatibility
└── lifecycle
```

Rules reference governed validation mechanisms through this registry or an equivalent abstraction.

The registry enables validation mechanisms to evolve without changing rule identities unnecessarily.

---

## Validation Planning

The engine should determine which validators are required before execution.

A validation plan may be derived from:

```text
Compliance Profile
       │
       ▼
Applicable Rules
       │
       ▼
Required Evidence
       │
       ▼
Required Validators
       │
       ▼
Validation Plan
```

Planning enables:

* duplicate-work reduction;
* evidence reuse;
* parallel validation;
* predictable execution;
* incremental validation.

---

## Evidence Architecture

Evidence is the factual output used to support rule evaluation.

Evidence must have a normalized representation.

A conceptual evidence object contains:

```text
ComplianceEvidence
├── id
├── type
├── source
├── producer
├── producer_version
├── plugin_id
├── plugin_version
├── timestamp
├── context
├── payload
└── integrity_metadata
```

Evidence may represent either direct observations or trusted results produced by another FamilyOS engineering system.

---

## Evidence Providers

Evidence may be generated by dedicated providers.

Examples include:

```text
Plugin Manifest ─────────► Metadata Evidence
Filesystem ──────────────► Structure Evidence
Dependency Graph ────────► Dependency Evidence
MyPy ────────────────────► Type Evidence
Ruff ────────────────────► Static Analysis Evidence
Pytest ──────────────────► Testing Evidence
Documentation Checks ────► Documentation Evidence
Runtime Tests ───────────► Lifecycle Evidence
```

The compliance framework should consume existing authoritative evidence where practical.

---

## Evidence Reuse

Evidence reuse avoids unnecessary repeated execution.

Conceptually:

```text
Engineering Tool
      │
      ▼
Trusted Evidence
      │
      ▼
Evidence Adapter
      │
      ▼
Compliance Evidence
      │
      ▼
Rule Evaluation
```

Reused evidence must satisfy requirements for:

* provenance;
* freshness;
* compatibility;
* integrity;
* scope.

Stale or incompatible evidence must not silently satisfy compliance rules.

---

## Rule Evaluation

Rule evaluation combines:

```text
Rule
 +
Evidence
 +
Validation Context
 =
Rule Outcome
```

The evaluator determines whether the rule:

* passes;
* fails;
* is not applicable;
* cannot be evaluated;
* encounters an evaluation error.

The exact canonical status vocabulary must be standardized by the framework specification.

---

## Rule Outcome Model

A conceptual rule result contains:

```text
RuleOutcome
├── rule_id
├── status
├── severity
├── evidence
├── message
├── validator
├── timestamp
└── remediation
```

Rule outcomes become the primary inputs for compliance decision derivation.

---

## Finding Architecture

A finding represents a compliance-relevant condition requiring visibility.

Findings commonly originate from failed or uncertain rule outcomes.

A conceptual model includes:

```text
ComplianceFinding
├── id
├── rule_id
├── domain
├── severity
├── status
├── title
├── message
├── evidence_refs
├── location
├── remediation
├── exception
└── suppression
```

Findings must remain structured and serializable.

---

## Finding Identity

Findings and rules have different identities.

A rule is a stable requirement.

A finding is an occurrence of a compliance condition during a particular evaluation.

Conceptually:

```text
Rule
 │
 ├── Evaluation A ───► Finding A
 │
 ├── Evaluation B ───► No Finding
 │
 └── Evaluation C ───► Finding C
```

This distinction is essential for historical tracking.

---

## Exception Architecture

Exceptions must be represented explicitly.

A conceptual exception contains:

```text
ComplianceException
├── id
├── rule_id
├── scope
├── justification
├── authority
├── created_at
├── expires_at
└── status
```

An exception modifies decision policy.

It must not rewrite historical evidence or falsely convert a failed rule into an ordinary pass.

---

## Suppression Architecture

Suppressions control visibility or handling of known findings without destroying their traceability.

A suppression should remain associated with:

* the finding;
* the rule;
* justification;
* scope;
* authority;
* expiration.

The underlying finding must remain recoverable in structured compliance data.

---

## Compliance Decision Engine

The Compliance Decision Engine derives the overall status from rule outcomes and policy.

Conceptually:

```text
Rule Outcomes
      +
Severity Policy
      +
Mandatory Rules
      +
Exceptions
      +
Profile
      =
Compliance Decision
```

The decision must never be produced through undocumented logic.

---

## Compliance Result

The canonical compliance result represents the complete outcome of an evaluation.

A conceptual model includes:

```text
ComplianceResult
├── evaluation_id
├── plugin
├── plugin_version
├── platform_version
├── framework_version
├── profile
├── status
├── rule_outcomes
├── findings
├── exceptions
├── evidence_refs
├── started_at
├── completed_at
└── certification_eligibility
```

This structured result is the source of truth for downstream reporting.

---

## Compliance Status

The framework should define a small, explicit set of overall compliance states.

A conceptual model may include:

```text
COMPLIANT
NON_COMPLIANT
INCOMPLETE
ERROR
```

Additional states should be introduced only when they represent materially different semantics.

The detailed status model must define exactly how rule outcomes map to the overall result.

---

## Reporting Architecture

Reports are projections of the canonical Compliance Result.

The architecture supports multiple representations:

```text
                Compliance Result
                       │
        ┌──────────────┼──────────────┐
        ▼              ▼              ▼
   CLI Report      JSON Report    Human Report
        │              │              │
        └──────────────┼──────────────┘
                       ▼
                  Same Meaning
```

Presentation must not alter compliance semantics.

---

## Machine-Readable Reports

Machine-readable reporting enables integration with:

* CI;
* build automation;
* release automation;
* dashboards;
* registries;
* certification systems;
* future governance tooling.

The canonical format must preserve:

* context;
* rule outcomes;
* evidence references;
* findings;
* status;
* framework versions.

---

## Human-Readable Reports

Human-readable reports should prioritize clarity.

A developer should quickly understand:

* whether the plugin is compliant;
* which profile was applied;
* which requirements failed;
* the severity of each issue;
* where problems exist;
* how they can be corrected.

Human reports should never require interpretation of raw internal engine structures.

---

## Compliance Pipeline

The complete conceptual pipeline is:

```text
Plugin
  │
  ▼
Discovery
  │
  ▼
Context Construction
  │
  ▼
Profile Resolution
  │
  ▼
Rule Resolution
  │
  ▼
Validation Planning
  │
  ▼
Evidence Collection
  │
  ▼
Rule Evaluation
  │
  ▼
Finding Generation
  │
  ▼
Decision Derivation
  │
  ▼
Compliance Result
  │
  ▼
Reporting
```

Each stage should expose clear contracts and failure semantics.

---

## Error Architecture

Compliance execution must distinguish system errors from plugin failures.

Examples:

```text
Invalid Plugin Metadata
        │
        ▼
Compliance Finding

Validator Crash
        │
        ▼
Validation Error

Missing Required Evidence
        │
        ▼
Incomplete Evaluation

Unsupported Rule
        │
        ▼
Framework Error or Unsupported State
```

These states must remain distinguishable in both structured and human-readable results.

---

## Incremental Validation

The architecture should permit incremental validation.

A plugin change affecting only documentation should not necessarily require every expensive validation mechanism to execute again if trustworthy compatible evidence remains available.

Incremental validation may use:

* changed files;
* affected domains;
* evidence freshness;
* dependency impact;
* rule dependencies.

Optimization must never weaken correctness.

---

## Parallel Validation

Independent validators should be capable of parallel execution where safe.

Conceptually:

```text
                Validation Plan
                      │
       ┌──────────────┼──────────────┐
       ▼              ▼              ▼
   Metadata       Dependencies      Tests
       │              │              │
       └──────────────┼──────────────┘
                      ▼
                   Evidence
```

Parallelism is an execution optimization.

It must not change validation semantics.

---

## Lifecycle Integration

Compliance validation can occur at multiple lifecycle stages.

```text
Development
    │
    ▼
Local Compliance
    │
    ▼
CI Compliance
    │
    ▼
Build Compliance
    │
    ▼
Release Compliance
    │
    ▼
Certification Compliance
    │
    ▼
Periodic Revalidation
```

Each stage may select an appropriate compliance profile while consuming the same rule catalog.

---

## CLI Integration

The FamilyOS CLI acts as a primary developer interface to compliance capabilities.

The architecture should eventually support operations for:

* validation;
* rule discovery;
* profile discovery;
* finding explanation;
* report generation;
* framework diagnostics.

CLI behavior must delegate to compliance services rather than reimplement compliance logic.

---

## CI Integration

CI systems should invoke the same compliance engine used by local tooling.

The desired model is:

```text
Local CLI ─────┐
               │
CI Pipeline ───┼──► Compliance Engine
               │
Release ───────┤
               │
Certification ─┘
```

This minimizes discrepancies between local and pipeline results.

---

## Certification Interface

The compliance framework must expose stable structured results to certification systems.

Certification consumes compliance evidence.

It must not directly depend on internal validator implementations.

The boundary is:

```text
Compliance Internals
        │
        ▼
Compliance Result
        │
        ▼
Certification Interface
        │
        ▼
Certification Process
```

This preserves architectural separation between compliance and certification.

---

## Extensibility Model

The framework must allow controlled extension through defined extension points.

Potential extension areas include:

* new rule domains;
* new rules;
* new validators;
* new evidence providers;
* new profiles;
* new report renderers.

Extensions must register through governed mechanisms.

Direct modification of compliance semantics by arbitrary plugins must not be permitted.

---

## Trust Boundary

The plugin being evaluated is not automatically a trusted participant in the compliance process.

A plugin may provide:

* metadata;
* declarations;
* configuration;
* test artifacts;
* supporting evidence.

However, the compliance engine determines whether those inputs are trustworthy and sufficient.

Conceptually:

```text
Untrusted / Partially Trusted Plugin Input
                  │
                  ▼
          Compliance Boundary
                  │
                  ▼
       Validation and Verification
                  │
                  ▼
          Trusted Result Model
```

This boundary is particularly important for future third-party plugins.

---

## Architecture Invariants

The Compliance Architecture establishes the following invariants:

1. Rules have stable identities.
2. Profiles compose rules.
3. Validators do not define policy.
4. Evidence supports rule evaluation.
5. Findings reference rules and evidence.
6. Compliance status is derived.
7. Plugins cannot self-certify compliance.
8. Exceptions remain explicit.
9. Unknown validation states are visible.
10. Reports derive from structured results.
11. Tooling does not redefine compliance semantics.
12. Certification consumes compliance results rather than validator internals.

These invariants should remain stable even as implementation details evolve.

---

## Reference Architecture

The complete reference model is:

```text

│              Compliance Governance            │

```

## Architecture Evolution

The architecture must support future capabilities without invalidating its fundamental contracts.

Possible future evolution includes:

* distributed evidence collection;
* signed compliance evidence;
* compliance artifact attestation;
* remote plugin registries;
* certification registries;
* policy bundles;
* incremental rule evaluation;
* compliance history;
* ecosystem-wide compliance analytics.

These capabilities should extend the architecture rather than bypass it.

## Architecture Summary

The Plugin Compliance Architecture establishes a clear separation between:

```text
Requirements
     │
     ▼
Rules
     │
     ▼
Profiles
     │
     ▼
Validation
     │
     ▼
Evidence
     │
     ▼
Findings
     │
     ▼
Decision
     │
     ▼
Reporting
```

This separation provides the foundation required for deterministic, scalable, explainable, and auditable plugin compliance.

## Final Architecture Principle

The architectural principle of EPIC-PLUGIN-002 is:

> Compliance is a derived result of governed rules evaluated against trustworthy evidence.

No plugin, validator, tool, or pipeline should bypass this model by independently declaring compliance.

This architecture establishes one consistent compliance language for the entire FamilyOS plugin ecosystem.
