# EPIC-OPS-001 — Operations Framework Manifest

## Document Status

```text
EPIC:                    EPIC-OPS-001
Title:                   Operations Framework
Framework Version:       5.1.0

Historical Publication:  Published
Historical Tag:          v5.1.0-operations-framework
Historical Tag Policy:   Immutable

Current Activity:         Post-Release Revalidation
Repository Validation:   Validated
Final Revalidation:      Validated
```

---

## 1. Purpose

This manifest defines the canonical repository inventory for:

```text
EPIC-OPS-001 — Operations Framework
```

It establishes:

* canonical numbered-document membership;
* canonical control-document membership;
* repository structure;
* document responsibilities;
* historical publication metadata;
* current normalization metadata;
* validation expectations;
* synchronization requirements.

The manifest is authoritative for current repository inventory.

It does not replace the normative authority of the numbered Operations Framework documents.

---

## 2. Repository Location

The canonical repository location is:

```text
docs/epics/EPIC-OPS-001-operations-framework/
```

All canonical Operations Framework documents SHALL reside directly within this directory unless a later governed revision explicitly changes the repository layout.

---

## 3. Framework Identity

```text
EPIC ID:                 EPIC-OPS-001
Framework Name:          Operations Framework
Framework Version:       5.1.0
Framework Type:          Engineering Framework
Domain:                  Operations
Historical State:        Published
```

The framework establishes the canonical FamilyOS operational foundation.

---

## 4. Historical Publication

EPIC-OPS-001 was historically published before the current standardized FamilyOS EPIC control-document model was applied.

Historical release:

```text
Tag:                     v5.1.0-operations-framework
Commit:                  1e4104000f719a030b1ae72839708e0a877960d1
Publication Status:      Published
Tag Policy:              Immutable
```

The historical tag SHALL NOT be moved during post-release normalization.

The current repository representation may therefore differ structurally from the historical tagged representation without invalidating the historical publication.

---

## 5. Historical Repository Structure

At historical publication time, EPIC-OPS-001 consisted of ten numbered documents.

Historical structure:

```text
Numbered Documents:      10
Control Documents:        0
Historical Files:        10
Canonical Range:         00 → 09
```

The historical publication did not contain the seven standardized control documents used by the current FamilyOS framework-governance model.

This distinction SHALL remain explicit.

---

## 6. Current Canonical Structure

The normalized current repository representation consists of:

```text
Numbered Documents:      10
Control Documents:        7
Canonical Files:         17
Canonical Range:         00 → 09
```

Canonical repository equation:

```text
10 numbered documents
+
7 control documents
=
17 canonical files
```

---

## 7. Canonical Numbered Documents

The canonical numbered-document set is:

```text
00-EPIC.md
01-Context-and-Vision.md
02-Operations-Principles.md
03-Operations-Architecture.md
04-Runtime-and-Service-Management.md
05-Incident-Response-and-Recovery.md
06-Capacity-Performance-and-Reliability.md
07-Operational-Security-and-Governance.md
08-Implementation-and-Automation.md
09-Validation-and-Release.md
```

The numbered sequence SHALL contain exactly ten documents.

---

## 8. Numbering Contract

The canonical numbered range is:

```text
00 → 09
```

Expected sequence:

```text
00
01
02
03
04
05
06
07
08
09
```

The sequence SHALL contain:

* no missing number;
* no duplicate number;
* no unexpected numbered document;
* no alternate canonical numbering scheme.

---

---

## 22. `EPIC-OPS-001.md`

Purpose:

```text
Provides the consolidated control-level representation of EPIC-OPS-001.
```

It SHOULD summarize:

* identity;
* purpose;
* scope;
* principles;
* architecture;
* deliverables;
* historical publication;
* current structure;
* lifecycle state;
* validation state.

---

## 23. `EPIC.yaml`

Purpose:

```text
Provides the machine-readable canonical contract for EPIC-OPS-001.
```

It SHALL define at minimum:

* EPIC identity;
* version;
* framework type;
* objectives;
* deliverables;
* structure;
* historical structure;
* validation state;
* historical publication identity;
* repository metadata;
* framework boundaries;
* closure state.

`EPIC.yaml` SHALL remain valid YAML.

Markdown fences SHALL NOT wrap the physical YAML file.

---

## 24. `README.md`

Purpose:

```text
Provides the human-readable orientation and navigation layer for the Operations Framework.
```

It SHOULD explain:

* framework purpose;
* operational principles;
* architecture;
* runtime management;
* incident response;
* recovery;

---

## 25. `MANIFEST.md`

Purpose:

```text
Defines canonical repository membership and structural expectations.
```

This document is authoritative for current repository inventory.

---

## 26. `CHANGELOG.md`

Purpose:

```text
Records meaningful Operations Framework changes over time.
```

The changelog SHALL distinguish:

* historical framework publication;
* current post-release normalization;
* future framework revisions.

Historical publication SHALL NOT be rewritten as though current control documents existed at release time.

---

## 27. `VALIDATION.md`

Purpose:

```text
Defines and records the validation contract for the normalized Operations Framework repository representation.
```

Validation SHOULD cover:

* YAML;
* filesystem;
* numbering;
* control documents;
* empty files;
* references;
* placeholders;

---

## 28. `Revision-History.md`

Purpose:

```text
Records the historical lifecycle of EPIC-OPS-001 and distinguishes historical publication from later repository normalization.
```

It SHOULD preserve:

* historical version;
* historical tag;
* historical publication commit;
* compact historical structure;
* normalization activity;
* validation state;
* future revision classification.

---

## 29. Canonical Deliverables

The current normalized canonical deliverable inventory consists of exactly seventeen files:

```text
00-EPIC.md
01-Context-and-Vision.md
02-Operations-Principles.md
03-Operations-Architecture.md
04-Runtime-and-Service-Management.md
05-Incident-Response-and-Recovery.md
06-Capacity-Performance-and-Reliability.md
07-Operational-Security-and-Governance.md
08-Implementation-and-Automation.md
09-Validation-and-Release.md
EPIC-OPS-001.md
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

Expected count:

```text
17
```

---

## 30. Inventory Contract

For the normalized repository state:

```text
Declared Files == Actual Files
```

Expected result:

```text
Declared Files:          17
Actual Files:            17
Missing Files:            0
Unexpected Files:         0
```

These values SHALL only become validated after actual repository execution confirms them.

---

## 31. Historical vs Current Structure

Two repository states SHALL remain explicitly distinguishable.

Historical publication:

```text
Tag:                     v5.1.0-operations-framework
Numbered Documents:      10
Control Documents:        0
Historical Files:        10
```

Current normalized repository:

```text
Numbered Documents:      10
Control Documents:        7
Canonical Files:         17
```

The normalized repository SHALL NOT imply that the seven control documents existed in the historical release.

---

## 32. Historical Tag Integrity

Historical release tag:

```text
v5.1.0-operations-framework
```

Expected historical commit:

```text
1e4104000f719a030b1ae72839708e0a877960d1
```

Normalization SHALL NOT move or recreate the historical tag.

Required relationship:

```text
historical tag commit
        ≠
future normalization commit
```

The historical tag remains an immutable reference to the original published Operations Framework state.

---

## 33. Repository Synchronization

The following documents SHALL remain structurally synchronized:

```text
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
EPIC-OPS-001.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
CHANGELOG.md
```

Synchronization includes:

* EPIC identity;
* framework version;
* canonical range;
* numbered-document count;
* control-document count;
* canonical-file count;
* historical tag;
* historical commit;
* publication state;
* current revalidation state.

---

## 34. Structure Contract

Current expected structure:

```text
structure:
  numbered_documents: 10
  canonical_document_range: 00-09
  control_documents: 7
  canonical_files: 17
```

Any deviation requires investigation before current repository revalidation may pass.

---

## 35. Historical Structure Contract

Historical publication structure:

```text
historical_structure:
  numbered_documents: 10
  canonical_document_range: 00-09
  control_documents: 0
  canonical_files: 10
  documentation_model: compact
```

This structure belongs specifically to the published historical state.

---

## 36. Numbered Document Contract

A canonical numbered document SHALL match:

```text
NN-*.md
```

where:

```text
NN ∈ {00, 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09}
```

Exactly one canonical document SHALL exist for each number.

---

## 37. Control Document Contract

Expected control documents:

```text
EPIC-OPS-001.md
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

Missing or unexpected control documents SHALL prevent structural validation from passing unless explicitly governed by a later revision.

---

## 38. Empty File Policy

Canonical files SHALL NOT be empty.

Expected validation result:

```text
Empty Files: 0
```

A zero-byte canonical file SHALL fail repository validation.

---

## 39. Reference Integrity

Local Markdown references SHOULD resolve to existing canonical content where they represent active repository links.

Validation SHALL distinguish:

* active canonical references;
* historical references;
* illustrative examples;
* external references.

Historical text SHALL NOT automatically fail reference validation merely because it describes an earlier repository state.

---

## 40. Placeholder Policy

Potential unresolved markers may include:

```text
TODO
TBD
FIXME
PLACEHOLDER
XXX
TO BE DEFINED
TO BE COMPLETED
```

Validation SHALL distinguish genuine unresolved placeholders from:

* examples;
* placeholder-detection documentation;
* historical text;
* intentionally quoted markers.

Only genuine unresolved blocking placeholders SHALL fail validation.

---

## 41. Join Defect Policy

Documentation SHALL be checked for accidental malformed word joins.

Known examples already visible in the historical numbered baseline include forms such as:

```text
bya
appropriatvalidation
requirerewriting
withstructured
logicSHOULD
whenthe
failurebehavior
```

These examples illustrate why join-defect validation is required.

Because the numbered documents form the historical published baseline, current control normalization SHALL distinguish:

* historical textual defects;
* newly introduced control-document defects;
* technical identifiers;
* intentional code symbols.

Historical correction, if required, SHALL be governed separately from control-document normalization.

---

## 42. Operations Semantic Integrity

Repository validation SHALL confirm that normalization preserves core Operations Framework semantics.

Important areas include:

* operational ownership;
* controlled change;
* runtime state;
* configuration;
* dependencies;
* health;
* readiness;
* incidents;
* recovery;
* rollback;
* capacity;
* performance;
* reliability;
* operational security;
* governance;
* automation;
* validation.

Normalization SHALL NOT silently weaken these requirements.

---

## 43. Ownership Integrity

Operational responsibilities SHOULD have explicit ownership where appropriate.

Ownership may apply to:

* services;
* runtime environments;
* incidents;
* alerts;
* automation;
* recovery;
* privileged operations.

Ambiguous ownership SHOULD be treated as operational risk.

---

## 44. Controlled Change Integrity

Operational changes SHOULD remain intentional and reviewable.

Examples include:

* configuration modifications;
* service changes;
* infrastructure changes;
* maintenance;
* deployment;
* credential rotation.

High-impact change SHOULD receive proportionally stronger control and validation.

---

## 45. Runtime State Integrity

Runtime state SHOULD remain explicit.

Representative states may include:

```text
DEFINED
CONFIGURED
STARTING
READY
RUNNING
DEGRADED
FAILED
RECOVERING
STOPPED
```

Exact state models may vary, but ambiguous state SHOULD be avoided.

---

## 46. Configuration Integrity

Critical operational configuration MUST be validated before unsafe execution.

Configuration validation may cover:

* schema;
* required fields;
* dependency configuration;
* environment constraints;
* security requirements.

Invalid critical configuration SHOULD fail safely.

---

## 47. Health Integrity

Health SHOULD describe meaningful operational condition.

Health SHALL remain distinct from mere process existence.

A process may exist while operationally unhealthy.

---

## 48. Readiness Integrity

Readiness indicates whether a component can perform its intended responsibilities.

A process may be alive while not ready.

Readiness may depend on:

* initialization;
* dependencies;
* configuration;
* migration state;
* secrets;
* required resources.

---

## 49. Dependency Integrity

Operational dependencies SHALL remain explicit.

Dependency handling SHOULD consider:

* identity;
* availability;
* authorization;
* compatibility;
* failure;
* timeout;
* retry;
* degradation;
* recovery.

---

## 50. Incident Response Integrity

Significant incidents SHOULD follow structured response.

A general model is:

```text
Detection
    ↓
Assessment
    ↓
Classification
    ↓
Containment
    ↓
Recovery
    ↓
Validation
    ↓
Closure
    ↓
Learning
```

Incident response SHOULD produce appropriate evidence.

---

## 51. Recovery Integrity

Recovery SHALL remain incomplete until resulting state has been validated.

Conceptually:

```text
Restored
    +
Validated
    =
Recovered
```

Restart alone SHALL NOT prove recovery.

---

## 52. Rollback Integrity

Rollback SHALL be treated as a controlled recovery action.

Rollback SHOULD consider:

* version;
* configuration;
* data;
* dependencies;
* migration state;
* security;
* validation.

Rollback completion SHALL NOT automatically imply successful restoration.

---

## 53. Capacity Integrity

Capacity decisions SHOULD remain evidence-based.

Relevant considerations may include:

* workload;
* concurrency;
* storage;
* memory;
* compute;
* network;
* dependency limits;
* operating margin.

Infrastructure complexity SHOULD remain proportional to demonstrated need.

---

## 54. Performance Integrity

Performance SHOULD remain measurable.

Potential indicators include:

* latency;
* throughput;
* resource utilization;
* startup time;
* recovery time;
* queue delay;
* dependency performance.

Performance validation SHOULD identify the relevant artifact or build where practical.

---

## 55. Reliability Integrity

Reliability mechanisms may include:

* timeouts;
* retries;
* isolation;
* degradation;
* recovery;
* rollback;
* capacity margins;
* dependency controls.

Reliability SHALL NOT bypass correctness or security.

---

## 56. Operational Security Integrity

Operations SHALL preserve Security Framework controls.

Operational convenience SHALL NOT bypass:

* authentication;
* authorization;
* secret protection;
* protected state-change requirements;
* security validation.

---

## 57. Governance Integrity

Operational governance may define:

* ownership;
* authority;
* change approval;
* maintenance;
* emergency action;
* incident escalation;
* recovery approval;
* evidence.

Governance SHOULD remain proportional to operational impact.

---

## 58. Automation Integrity

Operational automation SHALL remain controlled.

Preferred flow:

```text
Input
    ↓
Validation
    ↓
Authorization
    ↓
Execution
    ↓
Observation
    ↓
Post-Execution Validation
    ↓
Evidence
```

Automation SHALL NOT bypass security or required validation.

---

## 59. Infrastructure Neutrality Integrity

Core operations concepts SHALL remain infrastructure-neutral.

The framework SHALL NOT require a specific:

* cloud;
* container platform;
* orchestrator;
* operating system;
* IaC tool;
* deployment service.

Adapters may implement canonical operational interfaces for specific environments.

---

## 60. Testing Boundary

EPIC-TST-001 remains authoritative for general testing architecture.

EPIC-OPS-001 defines operations-specific testing requirements.

Relationship:

```text
Operational Requirement
        ↓
Testing Mechanism
        ↓
Operational Evidence
```

The Operations Framework SHALL NOT establish a competing general testing lifecycle.

---

## 61. Quality Boundary

EPIC-QLT-001 remains authoritative for quality governance.

Operations may provide quality evidence regarding:

* runtime behavior;
* reliability;
* recoverability;
* performance;
* operational correctness.

---

## 62. Build Boundary

EPIC-BLD-001 remains authoritative for build engineering.

Operations consumes validated build artifacts.

Operational automation SHALL NOT modify application artifacts in uncontrolled ways that invalidate build provenance.

---

## 63. Release Boundary

EPIC-REL-001 remains authoritative for release engineering.

Operations may execute or support:

* deployment;
* activation;
* readiness verification;
* runtime validation;
* rollback;
* recovery.

Operations SHALL NOT redefine general release lifecycle semantics.

---

## 64. Observability Boundary

EPIC-OBS-001 remains authoritative for observability architecture.

Operations consumes observability evidence such as:

* logs;
* metrics;
* traces;
* health;
* diagnostics;
* correlation.

---

## 65. Security Boundary

EPIC-SEC-001 remains authoritative for security architecture and policy.

Operations consumes security controls but SHALL NOT redefine their authoritative semantics.

---

## 66. Evidence Model

Operations revalidation follows:

```text
Requirement
    ↓
Validation
    ↓
Observed Result
    ↓
Evidence
    ↓
Decision
```

Claims SHALL follow evidence.

Evidence SHALL NOT be inferred merely from documentation intent.

---

## 67. Validation Categories

The normalized repository SHOULD be validated across:

```text
YAML Parse
YAML Contract
Filesystem Contract
Numbering Integrity
Control Documents
Empty Files
Manifest Synchronization
README Synchronization
EPIC Summary Synchronization
Changelog Synchronization
Revision History Synchronization
State Consistency
Reference Integrity

Operational Security Consistency
Governance Consistency
Automation Consistency
Framework Boundary Consistency
Historical Tag Integrity
Ruff
MyPy
Pytest
Diff Check
Final Repository State
```

---

## 68. Validation State

The current normalization activity SHALL initially use:

```text
documentation_status: completed
repository_validation_status: validated
final_validation_status: validated
```

These values SHALL remain pending until current repository evidence is actually produced.

---

## 69. Revalidation Transition

Permitted transition:

```text
Validated
        ↓
Repository Checks Executed
        ↓
Evidence Reviewed

## 70. Historical Publication State

Historical publication is already complete.

Therefore:

```text
Historical Publication: Published
Historical Tag:          v5.1.0-operations-framework
Historical Tag Policy:   Immutable
```

Post-release normalization SHALL NOT return the historical publication to a pending state.

Only the current normalized repository validation state remains subject to revalidation.

---

## 71. Historical Validation Text

Historical numbered documents may contain states such as:

```text
PENDING
Ready for Final Validation
Implementation Status: Pending
```

when explicitly representing the state of the historical release process.

Such text SHALL NOT automatically be treated as the active current lifecycle state of the normalized control layer.

---

## 72. Change Governance

Changes to current canonical repository membership require synchronized updates to:

```text
EPIC.yaml
MANIFEST.md
README.md
EPIC-OPS-001.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
CHANGELOG.md
```

Changes affecting numbered-document membership require explicit framework revision review.

---

## 73. Future Structural Changes

Future versions may extend or reorganize the Operations Framework.

Such changes SHALL:

1. preserve historical release evidence;
2. document migration explicitly;
3. update canonical inventory;
4. update machine-readable metadata;
5. validate references;
6. record revision history;
7. avoid rewriting historical tags.
