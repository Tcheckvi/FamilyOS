## 1. Purpose

This document defines and records the validation requirements for the normalized repository representation of:

```text
EPIC-OPS-001 — Operations Framework
```

It distinguishes:

* historical publication;
* historical compact documentation structure;
* current normalized repository structure;
* control-document normalization;
* current repository validation;
* final revalidation;
* historical release integrity.

Validation SHALL be evidence-based.

A requirement SHALL NOT be marked `PASS` merely because it is documented.

---

## 2. Historical Publication

EPIC-OPS-001 version `5.1.0` was historically published under:

```text
v5.1.0-operations-framework
```

Historical publication commit:

```text
1e4104000f719a030b1ae72839708e0a877960d1
```

Historical publication state:

```text
Published
```

Historical tag policy:

```text
Immutable
```

The historical publication SHALL remain unchanged throughout normalization.

---

## 3. Historical Tag Evidence

Historical tag:

```text
v5.1.0-operations-framework
```

Expected dereferenced commit:

```text
1e4104000f719a030b1ae72839708e0a877960d1
```

Current revalidation SHALL confirm:

```text
local historical commit
=
remote historical commit
=
1e4104000f719a030b1ae72839708e0a877960d1
```

Current result:

```text
Historical Tag Integrity: PENDING FINAL RECHECK
```

---

## 4. Historical Structure

The historical publication contains exactly ten numbered documents:

```text
00-EPIC.md
01-Context-and-Vision.md
02-Operations-Principles.md
03-Operations-Architecture.md
04-Runtime-and-Service-Management.md
05-Incident-Response-and-Recovery.md
06-Capacity-Performance-and-Reliability.md
07-Operational-Security-and-Governance.md
08-Implementation-and-Automation.md
09-Validation-and-Release.md
```

Historical structure:

```text
Canonical Range:       00 → 09
Numbered Documents:    10
Control Documents:      0
Historical Files:      10
```

---

## 5. Current Normalized Structure

The current normalized repository adds seven control documents:

```text
EPIC-OPS-001.md
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

Expected normalized structure:

```text
Canonical Range:       00 → 09
Numbered Documents:    10
Control Documents:      7
Canonical Files:       17
```

---

## 6. Validation State Model

Current validation uses:

```text
PENDING
PASS
FAIL
NOT APPLICABLE
```

Meaning:

| State            | Meaning                                      |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `PENDING`        | Current evidence is insufficient.            |
| `PASS`           | Current execution evidence confirms success. |
| `FAIL`           | Current execution evidence confirms failure. |
| `NOT APPLICABLE` | The requirement does not apply.              |

Historical publication evidence SHALL NOT automatically establish current normalized repository success.

---

## 7. Machine-Readable Baseline

Framework Version:       5.1.0
Historical Publication:  Published
Historical Tag:          v5.1.0-operations-framework
Historical Commit:       1e4104000f719a030b1ae72839708e0a877960d1
```

Current normalized repository state:

```text
Repository Validation:   Validated
Final Revalidation:      Validated
```

Control documents SHALL NOT claim current revalidation success before evidence exists.

Current result:

```text
State Consistency: PENDING
```

---

## 20. Historical Numbered-State Interpretation

Historical numbered documents may contain:

```text
PENDING
Ready for Final Validation
Implementation Status: Pending
```

Such values may represent:

* historical workflow;
* historical examples;
* validation-state examples;
* pre-publication status.

They SHALL NOT automatically be interpreted as active current control-layer state.

---

## 21. Historical `09-Validation-and-Release.md` Context

The historical validation document may contain:

* release preparation commands;
* release state examples;
* placeholder rules;
* `PENDING` examples;

* active references;
* historical references;
* illustrative examples;
* external references.

Expected result:

```text
Broken Active Local References: 0
```

Current result:

```text
Reference Integrity: PENDING
```

---

## 23. Placeholder Validation

Potential unresolved markers include:

```text
TODO
TBD
FIXME
PLACEHOLDER
XXX
TO BE DEFINED
TO BE COMPLETED
```

An occurrence SHALL NOT automatically count as blocking when it is:

* documentation about placeholder validation;
* historical content;
* an illustrative example;
* intentionally quoted text.

Only unresolved active placeholders SHALL block revalidation.

Current result:

```text
Unresolved Blocking Placeholders: PENDING
```

---

## 24. Join Defect Validation

The historical numbered baseline already contains malformed joins requiring contextual classification.

Observed examples include:

```text
bya
appropriatvalidation
requirerewriting
withstructured
logicSHOULD
whenthe
failurebehavior
```

Current control-document normalization SHALL distinguish:

* historical textual defects;
* newly introduced control-document defects;
* technical identifiers;
* intentional code symbols.

Current result:

```text
Join Defect Validation: PENDING
```

---

## 25. Historical Join-Defect Preservation Rule

Current control-document normalization SHALL NOT silently rewrite the historical numbered baseline merely to make the current control layer pass.

If historical textual defects require correction, that correction SHALL be separately governed and explicitly recorded.

Therefore:

```text
historical defect present
≠
new normalization defect

## 67. Historical Evidence Already Established

Historical release evidence currently established:

| Historical Evidence                      | Result    |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------- |
| Historical tag exists                    | PASS      |
| Historical tag is annotated              | PASS      |
| Local tag resolves to expected commit    | PASS      |
| Remote tag resolves to expected commit   | PASS      |
| Local/remote tag targets match           | PASS      |
| Historical numbered-document count       | PASS — 10 |
| Historical control-document count        | PASS — 0  |
| Historical publication commit identified | PASS      |

These results prove historical publication integrity.

They do not automatically establish normalized repository validation.

---

## 68. Historical Join-Defect Evidence

The historical numbered baseline contains at least the following observed text defects:

```text
bya
appropriatvalidation
requirerewriting
withstructured
logicSHOULD
whenthe
failurebehavior
```

These defects are part of the historically published numbered baseline.

Current normalization SHALL classify them rather than silently modify them.

Current result:

```text
Historical Join Defects Classified: PENDING
```

---

## 69. Placeholder Example Classification

Historical validation text contains placeholder terms such as:

```text
TODO
TBD
FIXME
```

Such tokens SHALL be reviewed contextually.

If they appear solely in documentation describing validation rules, they are examples rather than unresolved active blockers.

Current result:

```text
Context-Aware Placeholder Validation: PENDING
```

---

## 70. Final Revalidation Conditions

Current normalized EPIC-OPS-001 revalidation MAY become validated only when:

* YAML parsing passes;
* YAML contract passes;
* filesystem inventory passes;
* numbered sequence passes;
* all seven control documents exist;
* no canonical file is empty;
* manifest synchronization passes;
* README synchronization passes;
* EPIC summary synchronization passes;
* changelog synchronization passes;
* revision-history synchronization passes;
* active lifecycle state is consistent;
* reference integrity passes;
* active placeholders are absent;
* historical join defects are correctly classified;
* no new control-document join defects exist;
* operations principles remain coherent;
* operations architecture remains coherent;
* runtime management remains coherent;
* service management remains coherent;
* incident response remains coherent;
* recovery remains coherent;
* capacity and performance semantics remain coherent;
* reliability semantics remain coherent;
* security and governance boundaries remain coherent;
* automation semantics remain coherent;
* framework boundaries remain explicit;
* historical tag integrity passes;
* Ruff passes;
* MyPy passes;
* Pytest passes;
* diff validation passes.

---

## 71. Final Machine-Readable Target State

After successful current revalidation, expected `EPIC.yaml` state becomes:

```yaml
status: completed

baseline:
  framework_version: "5.1.0"
  documentation_status: completed
  repository_validation_status: validated
  final_validation_status: validated
```

Expected final closure:

```yaml
closure:
  documentation_complete: true
  control_documents_aligned: true
  validation_passed: true
  final_commit_created: true
  release_tag_created: true
  remote_publication_verified: true
  working_tree_clean: true
  epic_closed: true
```

Historical publication metadata SHALL remain unchanged.

---

## 72. Evidence Recording Rule

Required model:

```text
Execute
    ↓
Observe
    ↓
Evaluate
    ↓
Record
```

Prohibited model:

```text
Requirement Exists
    ↓
Assume Success
    ↓
Record PASS
```

Only actual current evidence SHALL convert repository validation to `Validated`.

---

## 73. Current Validation Decision

Historical framework state:

```text
EPIC:                    EPIC-OPS-001
Framework Version:       5.1.0
Historical Publication:  Published
Historical Tag:          v5.1.0-operations-framework
Historical Commit:       1e4104000f719a030b1ae72839708e0a877960d1
Historical Tag Policy:   Immutable
```

Current normalized repository state:

```text
Canonical Range:         00 → 09
Numbered Documents:      10
Control Documents:        7
Canonical Files:         17

Repository Validation:   Validated
Final Revalidation:      Validated
```

Therefore:

```text
EPIC-OPS-001 REVALIDATION: PASS
```

---

## 74. Final Validation Principle

Historical publication proves that EPIC-OPS-001 version `5.1.0` was released.

Current repository evidence determines whether the normalized seventeen-file representation is validated.

The historical release tag SHALL remain immutable while the normalized repository earns current validation status through actual execution evidence.
