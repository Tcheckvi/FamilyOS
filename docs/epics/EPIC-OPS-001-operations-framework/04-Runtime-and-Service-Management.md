# Operations Framework

## EPIC-OPS-001

## 04 Runtime and Service Management

### Overview

Runtime and service management define how FamilyOS services, processes, plugins, integrations, workloads, and operational dependencies are supervised throughout active execution.

A released component becomes an operational responsibility once it enters a runtime environment.

Runtime management therefore governs how services are:

* started;
* stopped;
* supervised;
* observed;
* configured;
* upgraded;
* degraded;
* restarted;
* recovered;
* retired.

Service management establishes the operational rules required to maintain predictable behavior across the complete service lifecycle.

FamilyOS MUST treat runtime behavior as governed state rather than uncontrolled process execution.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to establish FamilyOS requirements for:

* runtime environments;
* service identity;
* service lifecycle;
* process supervision;
* startup and shutdown;
* readiness;
* health;
* dependency management;
* runtime configuration;
* runtime state;
* service metadata;
* resource management;
* failure handling;
* restart behavior;
* graceful degradation;
* maintenance modes;
* service discovery;
* runtime security;
* runtime observability;
* service retirement.

The objective is to ensure that FamilyOS services remain understandable, controllable, observable, recoverable, and safe during operation.

---

## Runtime Management Objectives

FamilyOS runtime management MUST support the following objectives:

1. identify what is running;
2. determine which version is running;
3. determine whether a service is healthy;
4. control service lifecycle transitions;
5. maintain predictable runtime configuration;
6. supervise failures;
7. prevent uncontrolled restart behavior;
8. understand runtime dependencies;
9. limit resource consumption;
10. preserve runtime security;
11. expose sufficient operational telemetry;
12. support controlled maintenance and recovery;
13. preserve traceability across runtime changes.

---

## Runtime Model

The canonical FamilyOS runtime model is:

```text
Release Artifact
      │
      ▼
Runtime Environment
      │
      ▼
Service Initialization
      │
      ▼
Configuration Load
      │
      ▼
Dependency Validation
      │
      ▼
Service Startup
      │
      ▼
Readiness Validation
      │
      ▼
Active Runtime
      │
      ▼
Health Supervision
      │
      ▼
Lifecycle Management
```

Every transition SHOULD have explicit operational semantics.

---

## Runtime Environment

A runtime environment is the operational context in which FamilyOS components execute.

An environment MAY include:

* operating system;
* process runtime;
* filesystem;
* network;
* storage;
* environment configuration;
* secrets;
* external integrations;
* operational tooling.

Runtime environments MUST have defined ownership and purpose.

---

## Environment Identity

Every operational environment SHOULD have an explicit identity.

Examples include:

```text
development
testing
staging
production
```

Environment identity SHOULD be available to:

* deployment tooling;
* runtime configuration;
* logs;
* observability;
* operational commands.

Operators MUST be able to determine which environment they are acting on.

---

## Environment Isolation

Runtime environments SHOULD be isolated according to risk.

Production SHOULD remain separated from lower-trust environments in areas including:

* credentials;
* data;
* configuration;
* network permissions;
* deployment authority.

Environment boundaries MUST NOT rely solely on naming conventions.

---

## Service Definition

A service is an independently operated runtime capability.

A service MAY represent:

* application process;
* API service;
* worker;
* scheduler;
* background processor;
* plugin host;
* integration process;
* infrastructure-facing component.

Every operational service SHOULD have explicit service metadata.

---

## Service Metadata

Service metadata SHOULD include:

```text
service_id
service_name
service_version
environment
owner
runtime_status
health_status
dependencies
configuration_version
deployment_id
```

Additional metadata MAY include:

* release tag;
* commit identifier;
* startup timestamp;
* instance identifier;
* region or location;
* runtime profile.

---

## Service Identity

Every service SHOULD have a stable identity independent of individual process instances.

Example:

```text
Service:
familyos.communication

Instance:
familyos.communication.instance-03
```

Stable service identity supports:

* observability;
* authorization;
* configuration;
* dependency mapping;
* incident response.

---

## Instance Identity

A running instance SHOULD have a unique runtime identifier where multiple instances MAY exist.

Instance identity SHOULD support correlation across:

* logs;
* metrics;
* traces;
* health information;
* incident evidence.

Instance identifiers SHOULD NOT be reused in ways that create ambiguity.

---

## Service Ownership

Every operational service SHOULD have an identifiable owner.

Ownership SHOULD include responsibility for:

* service health;
* operational documentation;
* dependency understanding;
* incidents;
* upgrades;
* recovery;
* retirement.

Services without ownership SHOULD NOT be considered operationally mature.

---

## Service Lifecycle

FamilyOS services SHOULD follow a defined lifecycle.

```text
DEFINED
   │
   ▼
PROVISIONED
   │
   ▼
STARTING
   │
   ▼
RUNNING
   │
   ▼
DEGRADED
   │
   ▼
STOPPING
   │
   ▼
STOPPED
   │
   ▼
RETIRED
```

Not every service requires every lifecycle state, but semantics SHOULD remain explicit.

---

## Defined State

DEFINED indicates that the service has an approved operational definition but is not yet provisioned.

The definition SHOULD include:

* service metadata;
* dependencies;
* configuration requirements;
* startup behavior;
* health model;
* operational ownership.

---

## Provisioned State

PROVISIONED indicates that runtime resources required by the service have been prepared.

Provisioning MAY include:

* directories;
* storage;
* credentials;
* network access;
* configuration;
* dependencies.

Provisioning MUST NOT automatically imply service readiness.

---

## Starting State

STARTING indicates that service initialization is underway.

During startup, the service MAY:

* load configuration;
* validate secrets;
* establish dependency connections;
* initialize storage;
* register capabilities;
* perform migrations where explicitly governed.

STARTING MUST be distinguishable from RUNNING when initialization is incomplete.

---

## Running State

RUNNING indicates that the process is active.

Running status alone MUST NOT imply that the service is healthy or ready.

FamilyOS SHOULD distinguish:

```text
Process Running
      ≠
Service Ready
      ≠
Service Healthy
```

---

## Degraded State

DEGRADED indicates that the service remains operational but some functionality or dependency is impaired.

Degraded operation SHOULD identify:

* affected capability;
* affected dependency;
* impact;
* expected recovery behavior.

Degraded state MUST NOT silently disable required security controls.

---

## Stopping State

STOPPING indicates controlled shutdown is underway.

The service SHOULD stop accepting new work where appropriate while completing or safely abandoning in-progress operations.

---

## Stopped State

STOPPED indicates that the service is not actively executing.

Stopped state SHOULD distinguish:

* intentional stop;
* completed shutdown;
* unexpected termination where known.

---

## Retired State

RETIRED indicates that the service is no longer expected to operate.

Retirement SHOULD address:

* credentials;
* configuration;
* storage;
* monitoring;
* deployment definitions;
* dependencies;
* documentation.

Retired services SHOULD NOT retain unnecessary privileged access.

---

## Service State Machine

A canonical runtime state model is:

```text
          ┌──────────────┐
          │   STARTING   │
          └──────┬───────┘
                 │
                 ▼
          ┌──────────────┐
     ┌───►│   RUNNING    │◄────┐
     │    └──────┬───────┘     │
     │           │             │
     │           ▼             │
     │    ┌──────────────┐     │
     └────│   DEGRADED   │─────┘
          └──────┬───────┘
                 │
                 ▼
          ┌──────────────┐
          │   STOPPING   │
          └──────┬───────┘
                 │
                 ▼
          ┌──────────────┐
          │   STOPPED    │
          └──────────────┘
```

Invalid state transitions SHOULD be prevented.

---

## Process Supervision

Operational processes SHOULD be supervised.

Supervision SHOULD detect:

* process termination;
* startup failure;
* repeated crashes;
* resource exhaustion;
* readiness failure.

Supervision MUST NOT create uncontrolled restart loops.

---

## Supervisor Responsibilities

A runtime supervisor MAY be responsible for:

* process creation;
* process monitoring;
* restart policy;
* signal forwarding;
* shutdown timeout;
* health integration;
* exit-code collection.

Supervisor behavior SHOULD remain predictable.

---

## Startup Management

Service startup SHOULD follow a deterministic sequence.

```text
Load Runtime Identity
        │
        ▼
Load Configuration
        │
        ▼
Load Secrets
        │
        ▼
Validate Configuration
        │
        ▼
Initialize Dependencies
        │
        ▼
Initialize Service
        │
        ▼
Expose Readiness
```

Critical initialization failure SHOULD stop startup safely.

---

## Startup Validation

Before becoming ready, a service SHOULD validate required conditions.

These MAY include:

* required configuration exists;
* credentials are available;
* storage is accessible;
* required dependencies are reachable;
* configuration is internally valid;
* required migrations are compatible.

A service MUST NOT declare readiness before essential startup requirements are satisfied.

---

## Startup Failure

Startup failure SHOULD produce:

* clear exit status;
* structured logs;
* actionable diagnostics;
* failure classification where practical.

Startup failure MUST NOT result in ambiguous partial operation.

---

## Shutdown Management

Services MUST support predictable shutdown behavior.

Shutdown MAY be triggered by:

* deployment;
* maintenance;
* operator request;
* infrastructure termination;
* failure recovery.

Shutdown SHOULD preserve data integrity and operational clarity.

---

## Graceful Shutdown

Services SHOULD support graceful shutdown where in-progress work exists.

A typical sequence is:

```text
Shutdown Requested
       │
       ▼
Stop Accepting New Work
       │
       ▼
Complete / Reconcile Active Work
       │
       ▼
Flush Required State
       │
       ▼
Close Dependencies
       │
       ▼
Terminate
```

Graceful shutdown SHOULD have a bounded timeout.

---

## Forced Shutdown

Forced termination MAY be necessary when graceful shutdown cannot complete.

Forced shutdown SHOULD be treated as an exceptional path.

Systems SHOULD be designed so that forced termination does not create unrecoverable corruption.

---

## Exit Codes

Services SHOULD use meaningful process exit codes where applicable.

Exit status SHOULD distinguish, where practical:

* normal shutdown;
* configuration error;
* dependency failure;
* runtime failure;
* operator-requested stop.

Operational tooling SHOULD preserve exit status information.

---

## Readiness

Readiness indicates whether a service is able to accept its intended workload.

A service MAY be running but not ready.

Readiness MAY depend on:

* configuration validity;
* dependency availability;
* initialization completion;
* required data state;
* migration completion.

Readiness SHOULD be externally observable where practical.

---

## Readiness Checks

Readiness checks SHOULD be:

* fast;
* deterministic;
* low-cost;
* meaningful.

A readiness check MUST NOT perform destructive operations.

Failure of a required dependency MAY cause readiness to become false.

---

## Liveness

Liveness indicates whether the service process is functioning sufficiently to continue execution.

Liveness checks SHOULD detect irrecoverable runtime deadlock or process failure where practical.

Liveness MUST NOT be tied unnecessarily to every external dependency.

Otherwise, external outages may cause restart storms.

---

## Health

Health represents the broader operational condition of a service.

Health MAY include:

```text
HEALTHY
DEGRADED
UNHEALTHY
UNKNOWN
```

Health SHOULD combine meaningful operational signals rather than simply process existence.

---

## Health Dimensions

Health MAY consider:

* process state;
* readiness;
* dependency status;
* error rate;
* resource usage;
* queue state;
* storage state;
* internal failure conditions.

Health semantics SHOULD remain stable enough for automation.

---

## Health Aggregation

Service health MAY aggregate multiple component signals.

```text
Application Health
      +
Database Health
      +
Dependency Health
      +
Runtime State
      │
      ▼
Service Health
```

Aggregation rules SHOULD avoid masking critical failures.

---

## Unknown Health

UNKNOWN SHOULD be used when health cannot be determined reliably.

Unknown state SHOULD NOT automatically be interpreted as healthy.

For critical services, prolonged unknown state SHOULD trigger investigation.

---

## Dependency Management

Operational services SHOULD declare important runtime dependencies.

Dependencies MAY include:

* databases;
* storage;
* identity services;
* plugin runtime;
* external APIs;
* messaging systems;
* network services.

Dependency relationships SHOULD be documented and observable.

---

## Dependency Classification

Dependencies SHOULD be classified according to their operational importance.

Possible categories include:

```text
REQUIRED
DEGRADED-CAPABLE
OPTIONAL
```

REQUIRED dependencies prevent useful operation when unavailable.

DEGRADED-CAPABLE dependencies allow partial service operation.

OPTIONAL dependencies do not affect core readiness.

---

## Dependency Startup

Service startup MUST NOT rely on arbitrary fixed sleep periods as the primary dependency-readiness mechanism.

Services SHOULD use:

* explicit readiness;
* bounded retry;
* timeout;
* backoff.

Dependency initialization SHOULD fail clearly when requirements cannot be satisfied.

---

## External Dependencies

External dependencies MUST be treated as potentially unreliable.

Runtime behavior SHOULD account for:

* timeout;
* throttling;
* rate limiting;
* malformed responses;
* intermittent failure;
* prolonged outage.

External dependency failure SHOULD NOT automatically cause uncontrolled platform-wide failure.

---

## Dependency Timeouts

Network and remote dependency operations SHOULD use bounded timeouts.

Unbounded waiting can cause:

* resource exhaustion;
* thread exhaustion;
* queue growth;
* cascading failures.

Timeout values SHOULD reflect expected service behavior.

---

## Retry Policy

Retries MAY improve resilience for transient failures.

Retry policies MUST be bounded.

Retries SHOULD define:

* maximum attempts;
* delay;
* backoff;
* retryable errors;
* non-retryable errors.

Blind retry of permanent failures SHOULD be avoided.

---

## Exponential Backoff

Where repeated retries are appropriate, exponential or progressive backoff SHOULD be considered.

Example:

```text
Attempt 1 → 1s
Attempt 2 → 2s
Attempt 3 → 4s
Attempt 4 → 8s
```

Randomized jitter MAY be used to reduce synchronized retry storms.

---

## Circuit Breaking

Circuit breaking MAY be used to protect services from repeatedly calling a failing dependency.

Conceptually:

```text
CLOSED
  │
  ▼
Failure Threshold
  │
  ▼
OPEN
  │
  ▼
Recovery Window
  │
  ▼
HALF-OPEN
  │
  ├── Success → CLOSED
  └── Failure → OPEN
```

Circuit-breaker behavior SHOULD be observable.

---

## Graceful Degradation

Services SHOULD support safe degradation where architecture permits.

Examples include:

* read-only operation;
* delayed processing;
* disabled optional integration;
* cached result use.

Degradation MUST NOT bypass:

* authorization;
* security policy;
* data-integrity requirements.

---

## Runtime Configuration

Runtime configuration controls service behavior and MUST be explicit.

Configuration SHOULD be:

* validated;
* environment-aware;
* traceable;
* documented;
* separable from source code.

Invalid critical configuration SHOULD prevent unsafe startup.

---

## Configuration Loading

Configuration loading SHOULD follow a deterministic precedence model.

For example:

```text
Built-In Defaults
       │
       ▼
Configuration File
       │
       ▼
Environment Overrides
       │
       ▼
Runtime Overrides
```

The actual precedence model MUST be documented.

---

## Configuration Validation

Configuration SHOULD be validated against an explicit schema where practical.

Validation SHOULD detect:

* missing required values;
* invalid types;
* unsupported combinations;
* invalid ranges;
* unsafe settings.

Validation errors SHOULD identify the affected configuration key without exposing secrets.

---

## Dynamic Configuration

Dynamic runtime configuration MAY be supported.

Changes MUST be governed according to risk.

Dynamic configuration SHOULD identify whether each setting:

* applies immediately;
* requires reload;
* requires restart;
* is immutable at runtime.

---

## Configuration Reload

Services MAY support controlled configuration reload.

Reload SHOULD:

* validate new configuration before activation;
* preserve old configuration on failure;
* generate an operational event;
* avoid partial application.

Atomic configuration replacement SHOULD be preferred.

---

## Configuration Drift

Runtime configuration SHOULD be comparable to intended configuration.

Significant drift MAY include:

* undocumented overrides;
* manual edits;
* outdated values;
* unexpected permissions;
* environment inconsistency.

Drift SHOULD be detectable where operationally significant.

---

## Runtime Secrets

Runtime secrets MUST follow EPIC-SEC-001 requirements.

Secrets SHOULD be loaded through approved mechanisms and SHOULD NOT be:

* embedded in code;
* printed to logs;
* exposed through health endpoints;
* returned in diagnostic output.

Services SHOULD access only the secrets they require.

---

## Runtime State

Runtime state is information generated or modified during service execution.

State MAY include:

* queues;
* caches;
* locks;
* checkpoints;
* temporary files;
* job status;
* session state.

Runtime state SHOULD have defined lifecycle semantics.

---

## Persistent State

Persistent state MUST be distinguished from ephemeral runtime state.

Persistent state SHOULD be stored through governed storage mechanisms.

Service restart MUST NOT unexpectedly destroy state that is required for correctness.

---

## Ephemeral State

Ephemeral state MAY be lost during restart.

Loss expectations SHOULD be explicit.

Systems SHOULD NOT accidentally treat required durable information as ephemeral.

---

## Cache Management

Caches SHOULD be treated as derived operational state unless explicitly designed otherwise.

Cache loss SHOULD NOT normally cause permanent data loss.

Cache behavior SHOULD define:

* expiration;
* invalidation;
* size limits;
* failure behavior.

---

## Lock Management

Runtime locks SHOULD have bounded lifecycle.

Distributed or long-lived locks SHOULD provide mechanisms for handling:

* process crash;
* timeout;
* orphaned ownership;
* recovery.

Locks SHOULD NOT create permanent unavailable state after failure.

---

## Job Management

Background jobs SHOULD have explicit state when operationally significant.

Possible states include:

```text
QUEUED
RUNNING
SUCCEEDED
FAILED
RETRYING
CANCELLED
```

Job state transitions SHOULD be traceable.

---

## Idempotent Processing

Background operations SHOULD be idempotent where practical.

Retrying an interrupted job SHOULD NOT create duplicate destructive effects.

Where idempotency is impossible, reconciliation mechanisms SHOULD exist.

---

## Runtime Resource Management

Services MUST operate within understood resource expectations.

Resources MAY include:

* CPU;
* memory;
* storage;
* file descriptors;
* threads;
* network connections;
* queue depth.

Unbounded resource consumption SHOULD be avoided.

---

## Resource Limits

Services SHOULD define limits where practical.

Example:

```text
Memory Limit
Connection Limit
Queue Limit
Worker Limit
Request Limit
```

Resource limits SHOULD fail in predictable ways.

---

## Resource Pressure

Services SHOULD expose signals for significant resource pressure.

Examples include:

* high memory use;
* disk saturation;
* queue growth;
* connection exhaustion;
* CPU saturation.

Operators SHOULD be able to detect resource pressure before catastrophic failure where possible.

---

## Backpressure

Systems SHOULD support backpressure when producers can overwhelm consumers.

Backpressure MAY include:

* queue limits;
* throttling;
* request rejection;
* delayed processing;
* rate limiting.

Unbounded queue growth SHOULD be avoided.

---

## Runtime Restart Policy

Restart behavior MUST be explicit.

Possible restart strategies include:

```text
NEVER
ON_FAILURE
ALWAYS
MANUAL
```

Automatic restart SHOULD be used only where it improves recovery safely.

---

## Restart Loop Prevention

Repeated crash-restart cycles MUST be bounded.

Controls MAY include:

* retry count;
* restart delay;
* exponential backoff;
* operator intervention threshold.

A permanently failing service MUST NOT consume unlimited resources through restart loops.

---

## Crash Recovery

After unexpected termination, services SHOULD recover to a known state.

Recovery MAY require:

* temporary-state cleanup;
* lock recovery;
* transaction reconciliation;
* queue reprocessing;
* state verification.

Crash recovery SHOULD preserve data integrity.

---

## Runtime Failure Classification

Runtime failures SHOULD be classified where useful.

Possible classes include:

```text
Configuration Failure
Dependency Failure
Resource Failure
Application Failure
Security Failure
Data Failure
Infrastructure Failure
```

Classification SHOULD improve incident triage.

---

## Maintenance Mode

Services MAY support maintenance mode when normal operation must be intentionally restricted.

Maintenance mode MAY:

* reject new writes;
* expose limited functionality;
* disable background processing;
* display maintenance status.

Maintenance mode MUST remain observable and controlled.

---

## Maintenance Entry

Entering maintenance mode SHOULD require explicit authorization.

The operation SHOULD record:

* actor;
* timestamp;
* reason;
* affected service;
* expected duration where known.

---

## Maintenance Exit

Leaving maintenance mode SHOULD verify that:

* service health is acceptable;
* required dependencies are available;
* migrations are complete;
* critical functionality works.

Maintenance mode MUST NOT remain enabled accidentally without visibility.

---

## Service Discovery

Where services communicate dynamically, FamilyOS MAY use service-discovery mechanisms.

Discovery SHOULD provide trustworthy mapping between:

```text
Service Identity
      │
      ▼
Runtime Endpoint
```

Discovery MUST NOT weaken authentication or authorization requirements.

---

## Endpoint Management

Runtime endpoints SHOULD be explicitly defined and controlled.

Services SHOULD avoid unnecessary network exposure.

Endpoint changes SHOULD be observable and governed.

---

## Port Management

Services SHOULD expose only required ports.

Unused ports SHOULD remain closed.

Port allocation SHOULD avoid ambiguous or undocumented runtime dependencies.

---

## Runtime Networking

Service networking SHOULD follow least-access principles.

Network policy MAY restrict:

* inbound traffic;
* outbound traffic;
* environment crossing;
* administrative endpoints.

Network controls SHOULD complement application security.

---

## Runtime Security

Operations MUST preserve the FamilyOS Security Framework during execution.

Runtime security includes:

* service identity;
* authentication;
* authorization;
* least privilege;
* secret protection;
* network restrictions;
* secure configuration;
* auditability.

Operational convenience MUST NOT invalidate security architecture.

---

## Runtime Privileges

Services SHOULD execute with the minimum permissions required.

Services SHOULD avoid unnecessary:

* administrative privileges;
* filesystem access;
* network access;
* secret access.

Privilege escalation MUST be explicit and governed.

---

## Process Isolation

Operational components SHOULD be isolated where practical.

Isolation MAY include:

* process boundaries;
* containers;
* filesystem permissions;
* network policy;
* separate service identities.

Isolation reduces failure and compromise propagation.

---

## Plugin Runtime Management

Plugins represent runtime extensions and MUST remain governed.

Plugin runtime management SHOULD track:

* plugin identity;
* plugin version;
* enabled state;
* capabilities;
* dependencies;
* runtime health.

Plugins MUST NOT be allowed to execute outside approved security and capability boundaries.

---

## Plugin Activation

Plugin activation SHOULD validate:

* plugin metadata;
* compatibility;
* capabilities;
* security requirements;
* dependencies;
* configuration.

Invalid plugins SHOULD fail activation safely.

---

## Plugin Deactivation

Plugins SHOULD support controlled deactivation where architecture permits.

Deactivation SHOULD consider:

* active work;
* state persistence;
* dependencies;
* capability deregistration.

A disabled plugin MUST NOT remain silently active.

---

## Runtime Observability

Every operationally significant service SHOULD emit sufficient observability data.

Signals SHOULD include, where appropriate:

* service start;
* service stop;
* version;
* health;
* failures;
* dependency state;
* resource pressure;
* configuration changes.

Observability MUST integrate with EPIC-OBS-001 — Observability Framework.

---

## Runtime Logging

Runtime logs SHOULD include sufficient context for operational diagnosis.

Context MAY include:

```text
timestamp
service_id
instance_id
environment
version
correlation_id
event
result
```

Logs MUST respect security and privacy requirements.

---

## Runtime Metrics

Services SHOULD expose meaningful operational metrics.

Metrics MAY include:

* request rate;
* error rate;
* latency;
* queue depth;
* resource usage;
* restart count;
* dependency failures;
* readiness state.

Metrics SHOULD support operational decisions.

---

## Runtime Tracing

Distributed or multi-component operations MAY use tracing.

Tracing SHOULD help determine:

* execution path;
* latency location;
* dependency interaction;
* failure origin.

Tracing MUST NOT expose secrets or unnecessary sensitive data.

---

## Runtime Events

Important service lifecycle transitions SHOULD produce operational events.

Examples include:

```text
SERVICE_STARTING
SERVICE_READY
SERVICE_DEGRADED
SERVICE_UNHEALTHY
SERVICE_STOPPING
SERVICE_STOPPED
CONFIGURATION_RELOADED
DEPENDENCY_UNAVAILABLE
```

Event names SHOULD remain consistent.

---

## Runtime Auditability

Security-sensitive or high-impact runtime actions SHOULD be auditable.

Examples include:

* maintenance activation;
* privileged restart;
* configuration change;
* plugin activation;
* service disablement;
* runtime permission changes.

Audit events SHOULD identify the responsible principal.

---

## Runtime Validation

Runtime state SHOULD be validated after significant changes.

Validation MAY occur after:

* deployment;
* restart;
* configuration change;
* dependency update;
* migration;
* recovery.

Validation SHOULD confirm that intended operation has been restored.

---

## Post-Deployment Runtime Validation

After deployment, FamilyOS SHOULD verify:

```text
Expected Version
      +
Expected Configuration
      +
Service Ready
      +
Service Healthy
      +
Required Dependencies
      +
Critical Functional Checks
      │
      ▼
Runtime Accepted
```

Deployment MUST NOT be considered complete before required validation succeeds.

---

## Runtime Reconciliation

Where desired state differs from actual state, operations SHOULD support reconciliation.

```text
Desired State
     │
     ▼
Compare
     ▲
     │
Actual State
     │
     ▼
Reconcile
```

Reconciliation SHOULD be safe and traceable.

---

## Service Availability

Runtime management SHOULD support the availability objectives defined for each service.

Availability requirements SHOULD reflect actual operational need.

Not every FamilyOS service requires identical availability targets.

---

## Service Criticality

Services SHOULD be classified according to operational importance.

A possible model includes:

```text
Critical
Important
Standard
Auxiliary
```

Criticality MAY influence:

* supervision;
* restart policy;
* redundancy;
* observability;
* recovery priority.

---

## Service Dependency Map

Important services SHOULD have documented dependency relationships.

Example:

```text
FamilyOS Core
    │
    ├── Identity
    ├── Storage
    ├── Plugin Runtime
    └── Observability
```

Dependency maps improve incident analysis and change-impact assessment.

---

## Service Startup Order

Where startup ordering is necessary, dependencies SHOULD define order.

However, architecture SHOULD avoid unnecessary hard startup coupling.

Services SHOULD prefer explicit readiness checks over fragile ordering assumptions.

---

## Service Shutdown Order

Shutdown MAY require dependency-aware sequencing.

Consumers SHOULD generally stop before required providers when orderly shutdown is necessary.

Shutdown design SHOULD minimize incomplete work or corruption.

---

## Runtime Compatibility

Runtime components SHOULD validate compatibility with required:

* platform version;
* plugin version;
* configuration version;
* schema version;
* dependency version.

Incompatible combinations SHOULD fail safely.

---

## Runtime Versioning

Every running service SHOULD expose its version through operationally accessible metadata.

Version identification SHOULD map to:

* release;
* artifact;
* commit or provenance record.

Operators MUST be able to identify deployed code accurately.

---

## Runtime Upgrades

Service upgrades SHOULD be controlled transitions.

Upgrade planning SHOULD consider:

* compatibility;
* state migration;
* dependency changes;
* rollback;
* observability;
* resource requirements.

Upgrades MUST be validated after completion.

---

## Zero-Downtime Upgrades

Zero-downtime deployment MAY be used where availability requirements justify the complexity.

Techniques MAY include:

* rolling deployment;
* blue-green deployment;
* parallel instances.

The strategy SHOULD preserve compatibility during transition.

---

## Rolling Deployment

Rolling deployment replaces instances gradually.

```text
Old Instances
      │
      ▼
Replace One Instance
      │
      ▼
Validate
      │
      ▼
Continue
```

Automatic progression SHOULD stop if health degrades.

---

## Blue-Green Deployment

Blue-green deployment MAY maintain two operational environments.

```text
Blue — Current
Green — Candidate
        │
        ▼
Validation
        │
        ▼
Traffic Switch
```

Rollback may be simplified if the previous environment remains intact.

---

## Service Retirement

Service retirement is an operational lifecycle event.

Retirement SHOULD include:

* traffic removal;
* dependency removal;
* credential revocation;
* data disposition;
* monitoring removal;
* configuration cleanup;
* documentation updates.

Retired services MUST NOT remain accidentally reachable.

---

## Retirement Validation

After retirement, FamilyOS SHOULD verify that:

* service processes are stopped;
* endpoints are inaccessible;
* credentials are revoked;
* unnecessary infrastructure is removed;
* dependent systems no longer require the service.

Retirement SHOULD be traceable.

---

## Runtime Documentation

Operationally significant services SHOULD have runtime documentation.

Documentation SHOULD include:

* service purpose;
* owner;
* startup;
* shutdown;
* configuration;
* dependencies;
* health model;
* recovery;
* troubleshooting.

Documentation MUST follow EPIC-DOC-001 — Documentation Framework.

---

## Service Runbooks

Critical and operationally complex services SHOULD have runbooks.

A service runbook SHOULD include:

```text
Service Identification
Health Verification
Common Failures
Restart Procedure
Dependency Checks
Recovery Procedure
Escalation
```

Runbooks SHOULD remain aligned with actual runtime behavior.

---

## Runtime Testing

Runtime management mechanisms SHOULD be tested.

Tests MAY include:

* startup;
* shutdown;
* readiness;
* liveness;
* restart;
* configuration reload;
* dependency failure;
* degraded behavior;
* resource limits.

Testing MUST integrate with EPIC-TST-001 — Testing Framework.

---

## Runtime Quality

Runtime behavior is part of FamilyOS quality.

Operational defects MAY include:

* false health reporting;
* unreliable startup;
* broken shutdown;
* restart loops;
* configuration drift;
* missing resource limits;
* unobservable failures.

Runtime quality SHOULD participate in EPIC-QLT-001 quality gates.

---

## Runtime Security Integration

Runtime management MUST enforce relevant requirements from EPIC-SEC-001 — Security Framework.

This includes:

* service identity;
* controlled privileges;
* secret protection;
* secure configuration;
* audit logging;
* isolation.

Runtime state MUST NOT weaken validated security guarantees.

---

## Release Integration

Runtime management begins from a validated release state.

EPIC-REL-001 — Release Framework establishes the authoritative release identity.

Runtime operations MUST preserve traceability from:

```text
Release
   │
   ▼
Artifact
   │
   ▼
Deployment
   │
   ▼
Service Instance
```

Operators SHOULD be able to identify this relationship.

---

## Build Integration

Runtime artifacts MUST correspond to controlled outputs defined by EPIC-BLD-001 — Build Framework.

Operations SHOULD NOT modify release artifacts manually after build without explicit governance.

Runtime configuration SHOULD remain separate from immutable application artifacts where practical.

---

## Observability Integration

EPIC-OBS-001 — Observability Framework provides the common telemetry architecture for runtime management.

Runtime services SHOULD use common standards for:

* logs;
* metrics;
* traces;
* events;
* correlation identifiers;
* health signals.

Operational tooling SHOULD consume these standardized signals.

---

## Security Integration

EPIC-SEC-001 defines runtime protection requirements.

Operations MUST preserve:

```text
Identity
   +
Authorization
   +
Secret Protection
   +
Data Protection
   +
Auditability
   +
Security Controls
```

Runtime management MUST NOT create bypass paths around these controls.

---

## Operational Governance

Material runtime-management changes SHOULD be governed.

Examples include:

* new service lifecycle states;
* restart-policy changes;
* privileged execution changes;
* dynamic configuration architecture;
* health-model changes;
* new service-discovery mechanisms.

High-impact changes SHOULD receive architecture and operational review.

---

## Runtime Exceptions

Operational exceptions MUST be explicit.

An exception SHOULD identify:

* affected service;
* requirement;
* reason;
* risk;
* compensating control;
* owner;
* expiration or review condition.

Permanent undocumented runtime exceptions are prohibited.

---

## Runtime Evidence

Operational evidence MAY include:

* startup events;
* deployment identifiers;
* service health;
* configuration version;
* restart history;
* incident records;
* resource metrics;
* maintenance events.

Evidence SHOULD support reconstruction of significant runtime events.

---

## Runtime Management Invariants

The following invariants apply across FamilyOS:

1. every operational service MUST have an identifiable runtime identity;
2. running MUST NOT automatically imply ready or healthy;
3. required startup validation MUST occur before readiness;
4. service shutdown SHOULD preserve integrity;
5. restart behavior MUST be bounded;
6. dependency calls SHOULD use appropriate timeouts;
7. retries MUST NOT be unlimited;
8. critical configuration MUST be validated;
9. secrets MUST NOT be exposed through runtime diagnostics;
10. service resource consumption SHOULD be bounded where practical;
11. service versions MUST be identifiable;
12. plugin runtime privileges MUST remain controlled;
13. important lifecycle transitions SHOULD be observable;
14. significant runtime actions SHOULD be traceable;
15. runtime state MUST remain compatible with the validated release state;
16. service retirement MUST include credential and dependency cleanup.

---

## Canonical Runtime Management Flow

The canonical FamilyOS runtime lifecycle is:

```text
                    Release Artifact
                          │
                          ▼
                    Deployment
                          │
                          ▼
                 Runtime Provisioning
                          │
                          ▼
                    STARTING
                          │
                          ▼
                Configuration Validation
                          │
                          ▼
                 Dependency Validation
                          │
                          ▼
                     READINESS
                          │
                          ▼
                     RUNNING
                          │
          ┌───────────────┼───────────────┐
          ▼               ▼               ▼
       Observe          Maintain        Protect
          │               │               │
          └───────────────┼───────────────┘
                          ▼
                    Health Evaluation
                          │
                ┌─────────┴─────────┐
                ▼                   ▼
             HEALTHY             DEGRADED
                │                   │
                │                   ▼
                │               Recovery
                │                   │
                └─────────┬─────────┘
                          ▼
                    Lifecycle Change
                          │
                          ▼
                     STOPPING
                          │
                          ▼
                      STOPPED
```

This model keeps runtime state observable and governed throughout service operation.

---

## Runtime Readiness Model

A FamilyOS service is operationally ready only when:

```text
Known Release
      +
Valid Configuration
      +
Required Secrets
      +
Required Dependencies
      +
Successful Startup
      +
Readiness Confirmed
      +
Observability Active
      +
Security Controls Active
      │
      ▼
SERVICE READY
```

Process existence alone is insufficient.

---

## Expected Outcomes

The FamilyOS Runtime and Service Management model enables:

* explicit service identities;
* controlled service lifecycle;
* predictable startup and shutdown;
* reliable readiness and health semantics;
* supervised runtime processes;
* bounded restart behavior;
* dependency-aware operations;
* controlled configuration;
* managed runtime state;
* resource protection;
* graceful degradation;
* controlled maintenance;
* runtime security;
* strong observability;
* accurate deployed-version identification;
* safe upgrades and retirement;
* improved incident diagnosis and recovery.

---

## Final Principle

FamilyOS runtime and service management is based on the following principle:

> A running process is not an operationally managed service until its identity, configuration, dependencies, lifecycle, health, resource behavior, security state, and recovery behavior are explicit and observable.

Runtime management transforms released software into controlled operational services.

Service management ensures that these services remain understandable, predictable, recoverable, and governable throughout their active lifecycle.
