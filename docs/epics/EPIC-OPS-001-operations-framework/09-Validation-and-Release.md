# Operations Framework

## EPIC-OPS-001

### Validation and Release

### Overview

This document defines the final validation and release requirements for EPIC-OPS-001 — Operations Framework.

The purpose of validation is to determine whether the framework is sufficiently complete, coherent, testable, secure, and implementation-ready.

The purpose of release is to establish a clear completion boundary for the operational foundation before FamilyOS returns primarily to implementation.

EPIC-OPS-001 is intentionally compact.

Its completion criteria therefore focus on architectural sufficiency and implementation readiness rather than documentation volume.

---

## Validation Objectives

EPIC-OPS-001 validation must confirm that the framework:

* defines a coherent operational model;
* integrates existing FamilyOS frameworks correctly;
* establishes runtime lifecycle semantics;
* defines health and readiness expectations;
* defines incident-response principles;
* defines recovery and verification;
* defines reliability and capacity principles;
* defines operational security controls;
* defines governance expectations;
* defines implementation and automation strategy;
* contains no unresolved architectural blockers.

---

## Validation Philosophy

The Operations Framework is considered valid when FamilyOS has enough operational architecture to implement runtime management without requiring another major documentation phase.

The target is:

```text
Architecture
    ↓
Implementation
    ↓
Testing
    ↓
Operational Validation
    ↓
Release
```

Documentation is not the final product.

Operational capability is.

---

## Validation Scope

Validation covers:

* framework completeness;
* document consistency;
* runtime model;
* lifecycle model;
* dependency model;
* health model;
* incident model;
* recovery model;
* reliability model;
* capacity model;
* performance model;
* security integration;
* governance;
* automation;
* release integration.

---

## Canonical Documents

The canonical EPIC-OPS-001 documentation set is:

```text
00-EPIC.md
01-Context-and-Vision.md
02-Operations-Principles.md
03-Operations-Architecture.md
04-Runtime-and-Service-Management.md
05-Incident-Response-and-Recovery.md
06-Capacity-Performance-and-Reliability.md
07-Operational-Security-and-Governance.md
08-Implementation-and-Automation.md
09-Validation-and-Release.md
```

Exactly these 10 documents constitute the compact framework baseline.

---

## Completeness Validation

The framework is complete when:

* all 10 canonical documents exist;
* none of the canonical documents is empty;
* all documents identify `EPIC-OPS-001`;
* document responsibilities do not materially overlap without reason;
* required cross-framework relationships are defined;
* no required architectural topic remains unresolved.

---

## Document Consistency

Documents SHOULD use consistent terminology for:

```text
runtime
operational unit
health
readiness
liveness
dependency
incident
recovery
verification
operational evidence
```

Terms should not silently change meaning between documents.

---

## Runtime Model Validation

The framework must define how FamilyOS transitions from release into active execution.

Validation should confirm that the architecture covers:

```text
Released Artifact
      ↓
Configuration
      ↓
Validation
      ↓
Startup
      ↓
Readiness
      ↓
Runtime
      ↓
Health
      ↓
Operational Evidence
```

---

## Runtime Identity Validation

The architecture SHOULD support determining:

* which FamilyOS version is running;
* which release produced it;
* which environment is active;
* which configuration applies where relevant.

Runtime identity must remain traceable enough for diagnosis.

---

## Lifecycle Validation

Operational lifecycle semantics must be explicit enough to support implementation.

The framework should define meaningful concepts around:

```text
STARTING
READY
RUNNING
DEGRADED
UNHEALTHY
STOPPING
STOPPED
```

Not every state must become a concrete enum if implementation does not require it.

The semantics must still remain understandable.

---

## Startup Validation

The framework must establish that critical runtime prerequisites are checked before readiness is declared.

Potential startup requirements include:

* configuration validity;
* required dependencies;
* required credentials;
* repository availability;
* plugin initialization;
* security configuration.

---

## Shutdown Validation

The framework should define controlled shutdown expectations where stateful runtime behavior requires them.

Validation should confirm that shutdown considers:

* new-work acceptance;
* active work;
* persistent state;
* resource release;
* operational evidence.

---

## Configuration Validation

The framework must establish that critical runtime configuration is validated.

The required principle is:

```text
Invalid Critical Configuration
          ↓
Explicit Failure
```

rather than silent insecure or unstable fallback.

---

## Environment Validation

Where multiple environments exist, operational actions should be capable of identifying the intended environment.

The framework should prevent environment ambiguity from becoming a normal operational pattern.

---

## Dependency Validation

Operational dependencies should be distinguishable where their criticality affects behavior.

The framework must support concepts such as:

```text
Critical Dependency
Optional Dependency
Conditional Dependency
```

---

## Failure Isolation Validation

The architecture should favor containing failure within the smallest practical operational boundary.

For example:

```text
Optional Plugin Failure
        ↓
Plugin Degraded / Disabled
        ↓
Core Runtime Continues
```

where architecture permits.

---

## Health Validation

The framework must define a coherent health model.

At minimum, the following semantics should remain available:

```text
HEALTHY
DEGRADED
UNHEALTHY
UNKNOWN
```

Health should describe operational capability rather than merely process existence.

---

## Readiness Validation

Readiness must remain conceptually distinct from health and liveness.

The framework should support determining whether a component is able to accept and perform intended work.

---

## Liveness Validation

Liveness should represent whether an operational unit remains capable of progressing.

A unit may be alive without being ready.

The distinction must remain explicit.

---

## Observability Integration Validation

EPIC-OPS-001 MUST reuse the Observability Framework.

Validation should confirm that operations consumes:

* logs;
* metrics;
* traces;
* health;
* diagnostics;
* correlation.

Operations must not define a competing telemetry architecture.

---

## Security Integration Validation

EPIC-OPS-001 MUST apply EPIC-SEC-001 controls to privileged operational activity.

Validation should confirm that operational actions can be governed by:

```text
Authentication
Authorization
Least Privilege
Secret Protection
Security Events
```

---

## Privileged Action Validation

High-impact operations should be expressible through controlled flows.

Examples include:

```text
configuration change
runtime restart
plugin isolation
credential rotation
restore
rollback
```

Validation should confirm that these actions can be:

* authorized;
* executed;
* observed;
* verified.

---

## Incident Model Validation

The framework must define when operational failure becomes a managed incident.

It should distinguish:

```text
Event
Failure
Alert
Incident
```

These terms must not be treated as equivalent.

---

## Incident Severity Validation

A lightweight severity model should exist.

The framework uses:

```text
LOW
MEDIUM
HIGH
CRITICAL
```

Severity should reflect impact and urgency.

---

## Incident Lifecycle Validation

The framework must define a usable incident-response lifecycle.

The expected conceptual flow is:

```text
Detection
   ↓
Assessment
   ↓
Classification
   ↓
Containment
   ↓
Mitigation
   ↓
Recovery
   ↓
Verification
   ↓
Resolution
   ↓
Review
```

---

## Containment Validation

Containment must be recognized as a separate operational objective from full recovery.

The framework should support limiting ongoing damage before complete resolution.

---

## Recovery Validation

The framework must define multiple recovery strategies rather than relying on restart alone.

Potential strategies include:

```text
restart
retry
reconfigure
dependency restoration
plugin isolation
rollback
restore
```

---

## Recovery Verification

This is a mandatory framework invariant.

A recovery action is not complete until the resulting state is verified.

The required pattern is:

```text
Recovery Action
      ↓
Observation
      ↓
Health Validation
      ↓
Functional Validation
      ↓
Recovery Confirmed
```

---

## Failed Recovery Validation

Failed recovery must remain visible.

A failed recovery MUST NOT result in a false `RESOLVED` state.

The framework should support reassessment and escalation.

---

## Rollback Integration Validation

Release rollback remains governed by EPIC-REL-001.

Operations should consume rollback mechanisms rather than redefine release governance.

Validation should confirm this boundary.

---

## Backup and Restore Validation

Where persistent data requires backup, the framework must recognize that backup creation alone is insufficient.

The intended principle is:

```text
Backup
   +
Validated Restore
   =
Recoverability
```

---

## Reliability Validation

The framework must define reliability as more than uptime.

FamilyOS reliability combines:

```text
Correctness
     +
Availability
     +
Failure Isolation
     +
Recovery
     +
Operational Visibility
```

---

## Performance Validation

The framework should establish that performance is measured before major optimization.

Operational performance may consider:

* latency;
* throughput;
* execution duration;
* startup time;
* resource utilization.

---

## Capacity Validation

Capacity management should account for relevant resources such as:

```text
CPU
Memory
Storage
Connections
Workers
External Quotas
```

The framework does not require advanced automatic scaling.

---

## Resource Bound Validation

The framework should discourage uncontrolled resource growth.

Examples include:

* unbounded queues;
* unlimited retries;
* uncontrolled caches;
* unlimited worker creation.

---

## Retry Validation

Retries should be:

* bounded;
* observable;
* appropriate to operation semantics.

The framework must explicitly reject infinite retry behavior.

---

## Timeout Validation

External or potentially blocking operations should support bounded execution where indefinite waiting creates operational risk.

---

## Automation Validation

Operational automation must follow explicit contracts.

The framework requires:

```text
Condition
   ↓
Evaluation
   ↓
Action
   ↓
Verification
   ↓
Evidence
```

Automation without verification is incomplete.

---

## Automation Guardrail Validation

Automated operations should define:

* trigger;
* preconditions;
* authorized scope;
* maximum attempts;
* failure behavior;
* verification;
* escalation.

---

## Human Approval Validation

The framework must preserve the possibility of human approval for high-risk or destructive actions.

Automation must not erase meaningful decision boundaries.

---

## Governance Validation

Operational governance should remain proportional.

Validation should confirm that the framework distinguishes between:

```text
Routine
Controlled
High-Risk
Emergency
```

without requiring heavyweight processes for low-risk work.

---

## Operational Ownership Validation

Operationally significant components should support identifiable ownership.

The framework should make it possible to answer:

```text
Who understands this?

Who may approve major changes?

Who responds when it fails?
```

---

## Security Failure Validation

When required operational security controls fail, the protected action should not proceed.

The expected pattern is:

```text
Security Validation Failure
          ↓
Operational Action Rejected
          ↓
Evidence
```

---

## Secret Protection Validation

Operational interfaces and evidence MUST NOT intentionally expose:

* passwords;
* API keys;
* authentication tokens;
* private cryptographic material;
* equivalent credentials.

---

## Operational Evidence Validation

Significant operational activity should be capable of producing enough evidence to answer:

```text
What happened?

When?

Which component?

Which version?

Which action?

What result?
```

Evidence must remain proportional and privacy-safe.

---

## Evidence Correlation Validation

Operational evidence should support correlation where useful through identifiers such as:

```text
release_id
runtime_id
operation_id
correlation_id
incident_id
```

Not every signal requires every identifier.

---

## Privacy Validation

Operational evidence should minimize private family content.

Diagnostics and incident records should prefer operational metadata over unnecessary domain-content capture.

---

## Plugin Operations Validation

Operationally relevant plugin behavior should align with common framework semantics.

Validation should confirm the architecture supports:

* plugin lifecycle;
* plugin health;
* dependency state;
* isolation;
* controlled activation;
* controlled disablement.

---

## External Integration Validation

External systems must remain independent operational trust boundaries.

The framework should define expectations around:

* timeouts;
* retries;
* failure isolation;
* security;
* validation;
* observability.

---

## Framework Reuse Validation

EPIC-OPS-001 must not duplicate existing FamilyOS frameworks.

The following responsibilities remain externally owned:

```text
Testing       → Testing Framework
Quality       → Quality Framework
Build         → Build Framework
Release       → Release Framework
Observability → Observability Framework
Security      → Security Framework
Compliance    → Plugin Compliance Framework
```

Operations integrates them at runtime.

---

## Architecture Simplicity Validation

The framework must remain proportional to actual FamilyOS complexity.

Validation should reject unnecessary assumptions such as:

* mandatory Kubernetes;
* mandatory distributed orchestration;
* mandatory enterprise incident systems;
* mandatory multi-region infrastructure;
* mandatory 24/7 operations organization.

---

## Implementation Readiness

The framework is implementation-ready when the core operational contracts are sufficiently clear.

Potential initial contracts include:

```text
OperationalState
HealthStatus
HealthResult
DependencyStatus
OperationalAction
OperationalResult
Incident
IncidentSeverity
RecoveryAction
RecoveryResult
```

The final implementation may use fewer abstractions if simpler designs satisfy the requirements.

---

## Minimal Implementation Validation

The minimum implementation target should support:

```text
Released Artifact
      ↓
Validated Configuration
      ↓
Controlled Startup
      ↓
Runtime Health
      ↓
Operational Evidence
      ↓
Controlled Recovery
      ↓
Recovery Verification
```

This is sufficient for initial operational capability.

---

## Local Development Validation

Core operations behavior should remain testable and usable locally.

FamilyOS should not require production infrastructure to validate:

* lifecycle logic;
* health aggregation;
* incident state;
* recovery behavior;
* automation logic.

---

## Testability Validation

Operational contracts should support deterministic tests.

Tests may use:

* in-memory repositories;
* fake clocks;
* synthetic dependencies;
* controlled failure injection;
* fake runtime controllers.

---

## Static Quality Validation

Applicable implementation must continue to satisfy existing FamilyOS quality gates.

At minimum:

```text
Ruff
MyPy
Pytest
```

remain required for implementation scope.

---

## Operational Test Categories

Future implementation SHOULD support testing across:

```text
Lifecycle Tests
Health Tests
Dependency Tests
Failure Tests
Incident Tests
Recovery Tests
Security Tests
Automation Tests
```

Not every operational scenario needs a large end-to-end suite.

---

## Failure Injection Validation

Controlled failure injection MAY be used to validate:

* timeout behavior;
* dependency failure;
* plugin failure;
* invalid configuration;
* recovery behavior.

Failure injection should remain deterministic.

---

## Release Validation

Before EPIC-OPS-001 itself is released, validation must confirm that the framework documentation is complete and internally coherent.

This is a framework release, not a claim that every future operational feature has already been implemented.

---

## Framework Release Meaning

Release of EPIC-OPS-001 means:

```text
Operational Architecture Defined
        +
Validation Model Defined
        +
Implementation Strategy Defined
        =
Operations Framework Complete
```

It does not mean:

```text
Enterprise Operations Infrastructure Complete
```

---

## Target Release

The intended framework release is:

```text
v5.1.0-operations-framework
```

This release follows:

```text
v5.0.0-security-framework
```

---

## Predecessor Validation

Before release, the Operations Framework should reference its predecessor correctly.

Expected predecessor:

```text
EPIC-SEC-001 — Security Framework
v5.0.0-security-framework
```

---

## Release Preconditions

Before tagging the framework release:

* all 10 canonical documents must exist;
* all canonical documents must be non-empty;
* all documents must identify `EPIC-OPS-001`;
* no unresolved `TODO`, `TBD`, or `FIXME` markers may remain;
* no unintended placeholder content may remain;
* Markdown structure must be valid enough for repository conventions;
* staged changes must contain only intended EPIC files;
* `git diff --cached --check` must pass;
* working tree state must be understood before commit.

---

## Document Audit

The final documentation audit SHOULD verify:

```text
Canonical file count
Canonical filenames
Empty files
EPIC identifier
Markdown H1
Trailing whitespace
Unfinished markers
Target release
Predecessor release
```

---

## Git Staging Validation

Only the intended EPIC-OPS-001 files should be staged for the framework commit.

The expected staged scope is:

```text
docs/epics/EPIC-OPS-001-operations-framework/
```

with exactly 10 canonical Markdown files.

---

## Whitespace Validation

Before commit:

```text
git diff --cached --check
```

must produce no unexpected whitespace errors.

---

## Commit Validation

The framework should be committed with a clear semantic message.

Recommended commit:

```text
docs(operations): complete EPIC-OPS-001 Operations Framework
```

The resulting commit should contain exactly the intended framework documents.

---

## Working Tree Validation

After commit:

```text
git status
```

should report:

```text
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

before the release tag is created.

---

## Release Tag

The intended annotated tag is:

```text
v5.1.0-operations-framework
```

Recommended annotation:

```text
EPIC-OPS-001 Operations Framework completed
```

---

## Tag Target Validation

Before publication, the tag must point to the intended framework commit.

The following values must match:

```text
git rev-parse HEAD
git rev-list -n 1 v5.1.0-operations-framework
```

---

## Branch Publication

The framework commit must be published to the intended FamilyOS branch before or together with the release tag.

For the current engineering documentation workflow, the branch is:

```text
feature/foundation-engineering-docs
```

---

## Tag Publication

The annotated tag must be pushed explicitly.

Successful tag publication establishes the immutable framework release marker.

---

## Remote Branch Validation

After publication, local and remote branch targets must match.

Conceptually:

```text
Local HEAD
    =
Remote Branch HEAD
```

---

## Remote Tag Validation

For an annotated tag, remote verification may produce:

```text
<tag object SHA> refs/tags/v5.1.0-operations-framework
<commit SHA>     refs/tags/v5.1.0-operations-framework^{}
```

The dereferenced `^{}` target must match the framework commit.

---

## Final Release State

The desired final state is:

```text
EPIC-OPS-001 — Operations Framework

Documents       10/10
Audit           PASS
Commit          Published
Remote Branch   Synchronized
Tag             v5.1.0-operations-framework
Remote Tag      Published
Working Tree    Clean
```

---

## Framework Definition of Done

EPIC-OPS-001 is complete when:

* all 10 canonical documents are present;
* context and vision are defined;
* operations principles are defined;
* operations architecture is defined;
* runtime and service management are defined;
* incident response and recovery are defined;
* capacity, performance, and reliability are defined;
* operational security and governance are defined;
* implementation and automation are defined;
* validation and release requirements are defined;
* architecture is consistent with existing FamilyOS frameworks;
* implementation can begin without another major documentation phase;
* framework release validation passes.

---

## Operational Architecture Definition of Done

The operational architecture is sufficiently complete when FamilyOS has explicit models for:

```text
Runtime Identity
Lifecycle
Configuration
Dependencies
Health
Readiness
Failure
Incident
Recovery
Verification
Security
Evidence
Automation
```

---

## Incident Definition of Done

Incident architecture is complete when FamilyOS can conceptually:

* detect meaningful failure;
* classify incidents;
* contain impact;
* execute recovery;
* verify recovery;
* preserve evidence;
* learn from significant incidents.

---

## Reliability Definition of Done

Reliability architecture is complete when the framework establishes:

* failure isolation;
* bounded retries;
* timeouts;
* capacity awareness;
* performance measurement;
* recovery;
* evidence-driven improvement.

---

## Security Definition of Done

Operational security is complete at framework level when:

* privileged actions use explicit authority;
* least privilege applies;
* secrets remain protected;
* evidence access is controlled;
* high-risk actions have safeguards;
* security failure prevents protected state change.

---

## Automation Definition of Done

Operational automation is sufficiently defined when:

* stable procedures can be automated;
* preconditions are explicit;
* authority is bounded;
* retry attempts are bounded;
* outcomes are verified;
* failures escalate;
* evidence is produced.

---

## Non-Goals of Validation

Framework validation does not require:

* production deployment;
* enterprise orchestration;
* real disaster recovery;
* global availability;
* formal SRE staffing;
* enterprise incident software;
* production-grade monitoring infrastructure.

Those are implementation or operational maturity concerns, not prerequisites for framework release.

---

## Post-Release Rule

After EPIC-OPS-001 is released, FamilyOS SHOULD stop adding broad foundation frameworks unless a concrete architectural gap requires one.

The preferred workflow becomes:

```text
Architecture
    ↓
Implementation
    ↓
Testing
    ↓
Integration
    ↓
Validation
    ↓
Release
```

This rule exists to prevent documentation from replacing product development.

---

## Post-Framework Transition

EPIC-OPS-001 represents the final planned broad engineering foundation in this sequence.

After release, priority should move toward implementation of the established architecture.

The framework chain becomes:

```text
Engineering
    ↓
Testing
    ↓
Quality
    ↓
Build
    ↓
Release
    ↓
Observability
    ↓
Security
    ↓
Operations
    ↓
IMPLEMENTATION
```

---

## Future Framework Changes

Future changes to EPIC-OPS-001 should occur because:

* implementation exposes a genuine architectural gap;
* operational evidence demonstrates a missing requirement;
* security requirements change;
* deployment architecture changes materially.

Documentation expansion should not occur merely because additional topics could be documented.

---

## Success Criteria

EPIC-OPS-001 validation succeeds when FamilyOS can confidently state:

```text
We know how runtime should start.

We know how runtime state is represented.

We know how health is evaluated.

We know how dependencies affect operation.

We know how meaningful incidents are handled.

We know how recovery is performed.

We know that recovery must be verified.

We know how performance and capacity are approached.

We know how privileged operations are protected.

We know how stable procedures can be automated.

We know how operational evidence feeds engineering.
```

---

## Release Decision

The framework may be released when all validation requirements are satisfied and no unresolved architecture issue materially prevents implementation.

The release decision is therefore:

```text
Complete
   +
Consistent
   +
Validated
   +
Implementation-Ready
   =
RELEASE
```

---

## Expected Outcome

After release of EPIC-OPS-001, FamilyOS will possess a complete cross-cutting foundation for moving from engineered software to controlled runtime operation.

The platform will have architectural guidance for:

```text
Running
Observing
Managing
Protecting
Recovering
Verifying
Improving
```

its runtime behavior.

---

## Conclusion

EPIC-OPS-001 closes the planned sequence of broad FamilyOS engineering foundations.

Its validation standard is deliberately practical.

The Operations Framework is ready for release when its architecture is coherent enough to guide implementation, its boundaries align with the existing FamilyOS frameworks, and its operational invariants can be turned into code and tests.

The governing release principle is:

> Release the framework when it provides enough stable operational architecture to implement, test, recover, and improve FamilyOS without requiring another documentation phase.

**Target Release:** `v5.1.0-operations-framework`

**Predecessor:** `v5.0.0-security-framework`

**Framework Status:** Ready for Final Validation
