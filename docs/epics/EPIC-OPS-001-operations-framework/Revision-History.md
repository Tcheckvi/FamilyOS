# EPIC-OPS-001 — Operations Framework Revision History

## Document Purpose

This document records the evolution of **EPIC-OPS-001 — Operations Framework**.

It preserves the historical publication of version `5.1.0` while documenting the later normalization of the repository into the current FamilyOS EPIC control model.

The revision history distinguishes between:

* historical framework publication;
* historical compact documentation structure;
* immutable release identity;
* later control-document normalization;
* current repository revalidation;
* future framework evolution.

## 1. Revision Principles

The Operations Framework revision history follows several foundational principles.

### Historical Integrity

Historical publication state SHALL remain identifiable and immutable.

The release tag:

```text
v5.1.0-operations-framework
```

SHALL remain attached to:

```text
1e4104000f719a030b1ae72839708e0a877960d1
```

Later normalization commits SHALL NOT replace that historical publication identity.

---

### Explicit Evolution

Material changes to the Operations Framework SHOULD remain traceable.

This includes changes affecting:

* operations principles;
* operations architecture;
* runtime management;
* service management;
* configuration;
* dependency handling;
* health;
* readiness;
* incident response;
* recovery;
* rollback;
* capacity;
* performance;
* reliability;
* operational security;
* governance;
* automation;
* validation;
* release integration.

---

### Evidence-Based Validation

Validation state SHALL follow evidence.

A requirement SHALL NOT be marked `PASS` merely because it is documented.

The expected sequence is:

```text
Execute
    ↓
Observe
    ↓
Evaluate
    ↓
Record
```

---

### Structural Truth

The repository history SHALL preserve the distinction between:

```text
Historical Published Structure
```

and:

```text
Current Normalized Structure
```

The seven current control documents SHALL NOT be retroactively attributed to the historical version `5.1.0` publication.

---

## 2. Framework Version

The historically published Operations Framework version is:

```text
5.1.0
```

This version is part of the historical framework identity.

Post-release repository normalization does not by itself require a new semantic framework version when the normative numbered framework content remains unchanged.

---

## 3. Framework Version vs Repository History

Framework version:

```text
5.1.0
```

Historical release tag:

```text
v5.1.0-operations-framework
```

Historical release commit:

```text
1e4104000f719a030b1ae72839708e0a877960d1
```

A later repository-normalization commit may have a different Git identity while the framework remains version `5.1.0`.

---

## 4. Historical Documentation Model

The original Operations Framework used the compact FamilyOS framework documentation model.

Historical structure:

```text
Canonical Range:       00 → 09
Numbered Documents:    10
Control Documents:      0
Historical Files:      10
```

The historical release therefore consisted only of the ten numbered framework documents.

---

## 5. Historical Numbered Documents

The historical release contained:

```text
00-EPIC.md
01-Context-and-Vision.md
02-Operations-Principles.md
03-Operations-Architecture.md
04-Runtime-and-Service-Management.md
05-Incident-Response-and-Recovery.md
06-Capacity-Performance-and-Reliability.md
07-Operational-Security-and-Governance.md
08-Implementation-and-Automation.md
09-Validation-and-Release.md
```

These documents form the historical normative framework baseline.

---

## 6. Historical Publication

EPIC-OPS-001 version `5.1.0` was historically published under:

```text
v5.1.0-operations-framework
```

Historical publication commit:

```text
1e4104000f719a030b1ae72839708e0a877960d1
```

Historical publication status:

```text
Published
```

Historical tag policy:

```text
Immutable
```

---

## 7. Historical Tag Evidence

The historical tag exists as an annotated Git tag.

Its dereferenced target is:

```text
1e4104000f719a030b1ae72839708e0a877960d1
```

The authoritative remote has also been confirmed to resolve to the same historical commit.

This relationship SHALL remain unchanged through normalization.

---

## 8. Historical Tag Immutability

Post-release normalization SHALL NOT:

* move `v5.1.0-operations-framework`;
* delete and recreate it on another commit;
* force-update it;
* rewrite the publication commit;
* claim a later normalization commit as the original release;
* reinterpret later control documents as historical release content.

---

## 9. Operations Framework Foundation

Version `5.1.0` established the canonical FamilyOS Operations Framework.

The release defines:

* Operations Principles;
* Operations Architecture;
* Runtime Management;
* Service Management;
* Configuration;
* Dependency Management;
* Incident Response;
* Recovery;
* Rollback;
* Capacity;
* Performance;
* Reliability;
* Operational Security;
* Governance;
* Implementation;
* Automation;
* Validation;
* Release Integration.

---

## 10. Operations Principles Revision

Version `5.1.0` establishes principles including:

```text
Explicit Ownership
Controlled Change
Validated Runtime Configuration
Observable Operation
Recoverability
Evidence-Based Operation
Automation with Validation
Security by Default
Infrastructure Neutrality
Proportional Complexity
Repeatability
Deterministic Validation
```

These principles define the foundational operations posture for FamilyOS.

---

## 11. Explicit Ownership Revision

Operational responsibilities SHOULD have identifiable ownership.

Ownership may apply to:

* services;
* environments;
* incidents;
* automation;
* maintenance;
* recovery;
* privileged actions.

Ambiguous ownership increases operational risk.

---

## 12. Controlled Change Revision

Operational change SHOULD remain explicit and governed.

Examples include:

* configuration changes;
* environment changes;
* service changes;
* infrastructure changes;
* deployments;
* maintenance;
* credential rotation;
* recovery actions.

High-impact changes SHOULD receive proportionally stronger validation.

---

## 13. Runtime Configuration Revision

Critical runtime configuration SHOULD be validated before unsafe execution.

Validation may include:

* schema;
* required fields;
* value ranges;
* dependency configuration;
* environment constraints;
* security requirements.

Invalid configuration SHOULD fail safely.

---

## 14. Observable Operation Revision

Operational behavior SHOULD remain observable.

Useful evidence may include:

* logs;
* metrics;
* traces;
* health;
* readiness;
* runtime state;
* automation results;
* incident evidence;
* recovery evidence.

EPIC-OBS-001 remains authoritative for observability architecture.

---

## 15. Recoverability Revision

Failure is treated as an expected operational condition.

FamilyOS SHOULD therefore provide appropriate recovery mechanisms.

Recovery may involve:

* restart;
* retry;
* rollback;
* restore;
* failover;
* configuration correction;
* controlled manual intervention.

Recovery SHALL be validated.

---

## 16. Evidence-Based Operation Revision

Version `5.1.0` establishes that command completion does not by itself prove operational success.

Preferred model:

```text
Action
    ↓
Observed Result
    ↓
Validation
    ↓
Evidence
    ↓
Decision
```

This applies particularly to:

* deployment;
* rollback;
* recovery;
* restore;
* provisioning;
* configuration changes;
* credential rotation.

---

## 17. Automation Revision

Operational automation SHOULD improve repeatability and reduce operator error.

Automation SHALL:

* validate critical inputs;
* respect authorization;
* execute in a controlled manner;
* expose failures;
* validate important results;
* preserve evidence where appropriate.

Automation SHALL NOT bypass security or required validation.

---

## 18. Security-by-Default Revision

Operational convenience SHALL NOT weaken FamilyOS security controls.

Protected operations SHOULD require appropriate authorization.

Operational tooling SHALL NOT intentionally expose:

* passwords;
* tokens;
* private keys;
* credentials;
* sensitive configuration.

---

## 19. Infrastructure Neutrality Revision

The Operations Framework remains independent of specific infrastructure providers.

It does not require a particular:

* cloud platform;
* container orchestrator;
* deployment platform;
* operating system;
* infrastructure-as-code tool;
* monitoring vendor.

Operational contracts SHOULD remain portable.

---

## 20. Proportional Complexity Revision

Operational complexity SHOULD follow demonstrated need.

Preferred progression:

```text
Need
   ↓
Evidence
   ↓
Operational Requirement
   ↓
Appropriate Mechanism
   ↓
Validation
```

The framework explicitly avoids infrastructure complexity introduced solely because a technology is available.

---

## 21. Operations Architecture Revision

Version `5.1.0` establishes a layered operational architecture.

Conceptually:

```text
+--------------------------------------------------+
|             Operational Governance               |
+--------------------------------------------------+
| Security | Authorization | Validation | Evidence |
+--------------------------------------------------+
| Incidents | Recovery | Reliability | Capacity    |
+--------------------------------------------------+
| Runtime Management | Service Management          |
+--------------------------------------------------+
| Configuration | Dependencies | Health | Readiness|
+--------------------------------------------------+
|               Runtime Environment                |
+--------------------------------------------------+
```

The architecture separates operational policy from infrastructure-specific mechanisms.

---

## 22. Runtime Management Revision

Runtime management covers explicit lifecycle state.

Representative states may include:

```text
DEFINED
CONFIGURED
VALIDATED
STARTING
READY
RUNNING
DEGRADED
FAILED
RECOVERING
STOPPING
STOPPED
```

Exact state models may vary.

Operational meaning SHOULD remain explicit.

---

## 23. Service Management Revision

Service lifecycle expectations include:

* startup;
* initialization;
* configuration;
* dependency validation;
* health;
* readiness;
* normal operation;
* maintenance;
* degradation;
* failure;
* recovery;
* shutdown.

A service SHALL NOT be considered healthy merely because a process exists.

---

## 24. Health Revision

Version `5.1.0` establishes explicit operational health semantics.

Potential states include:

```text
HEALTHY
DEGRADED
UNHEALTHY
UNKNOWN
```

Health SHOULD communicate meaningful operational condition.

---

## 25. Readiness Revision

Readiness remains distinct from process existence and health.

A component may be running but not ready because:

* initialization is incomplete;
* dependencies are unavailable;
* configuration is invalid;
* migrations remain incomplete;
* required secrets are unavailable.

---

## 26. Dependency Management Revision

Operational dependency handling SHOULD remain explicit regarding:

* identity;
* availability;
* compatibility;
* authorization;
* timeout;
* retry;
* degradation;
* failure;
* recovery.

Dependency failure SHOULD not automatically cause uncontrolled failure propagation.

---

## 27. Incident Response Revision

Version `5.1.0` establishes structured incident response.

Conceptual lifecycle:

```text
Detection
    ↓
Assessment
    ↓
Classification
    ↓
Containment
    ↓
Recovery
    ↓
Validation
    ↓
Closure
    ↓
Learning
```

Significant incidents SHOULD produce structured learning and appropriate evidence.

---

## 28. Incident Classification Revision

Incident severity may consider:

* user impact;
* service impact;
* data impact;
* security impact;
* operational scope;
* duration;
* recoverability.

Severity SHOULD guide escalation and response rigor.

---

## 29. Incident Evidence Revision

Incident handling SHOULD preserve evidence appropriate to impact.

Evidence may support:

* diagnosis;
* recovery;
* security investigation;
* post-incident analysis;
* prevention.

Evidence SHALL remain security- and privacy-aware.

---

## 30. Recovery Revision

The framework establishes a strict distinction between restart, restoration, and recovery.

```text
Restarted != Recovered
Restored  != Validated
Recovered = Restored + Validated
```

Recovery validation may include:

* runtime integrity;
* service availability;
* dependency state;
* health;
* readiness;
* configuration;
* data integrity;
* security controls.

---

## 31. Restore Revision

Restore operations MAY involve:

* data;
* configuration;
* artifacts;
* runtime state;
* service state.

Restore SHALL be followed by validation appropriate to operational impact.

---

## 32. Rollback Revision

Rollback is treated as a controlled recovery action.

Rollback SHOULD consider:

* application version;
* configuration compatibility;
* data compatibility;
* migration state;
* dependency compatibility;
* security state.

Rollback completion SHALL NOT automatically prove successful recovery.

---

## 33. Capacity Revision

Version `5.1.0` establishes evidence-based capacity management.

Capacity considerations may include:

* compute;
* memory;
* storage;
* network;
* workload;
* concurrency;
* throughput;
* dependency limits;
* operating margins.

---

## 34. Performance Revision

Performance SHOULD be measured rather than assumed.

Potential indicators include:

* latency;
* throughput;
* resource utilization;
* startup duration;
* recovery duration;
* queue delay;
* dependency response time.

Performance evidence SHOULD identify relevant runtime context where practical.

---

## 35. Reliability Revision

Reliability engineering may include:

* timeouts;
* retries;
* dependency isolation;
* degradation;
* recovery;
* rollback;
* capacity margins;
* validation.

Reliability SHALL remain compatible with security and correctness.

---

## 36. Operational Security Revision

Version `5.1.0` integrates security into operations.

Operational security may include:

* authorization;
* protected state changes;
* secret protection;
* privileged-action controls;
* secure configuration;
* credential rotation;
* restore integrity;
* security validation.

EPIC-SEC-001 remains authoritative for Security Framework policy.

---

## 37. Governance Revision

Operational governance may define:

* ownership;
* authority;
* change control;
* maintenance;
* emergency procedures;
* privileged operations;
* incident escalation;
* recovery approval;
* evidence requirements.

Governance SHOULD remain proportional to operational impact.

---

## 38. Implementation Revision

The framework provides implementation direction while remaining infrastructure-neutral.

Implementation areas may include:

* runtime control;
* configuration validation;
* dependency validation;
* health mechanisms;
* service lifecycle control;
* automation;
* recovery tooling;
* incident tooling;
* operational evidence.

---

## 39. Infrastructure-as-Code Revision

Infrastructure SHOULD be represented declaratively where practical.

Infrastructure as Code may improve:

* reproducibility;
* reviewability;
* version control;
* recovery;
* drift detection;
* validation.

No specific IaC technology is mandated.

---

## 40. Automation Flow Revision

The framework establishes the conceptual operational automation flow:

```text
Input
    ↓
Validation
    ↓
Authorization
    ↓
Execution
    ↓
Observation
    ↓
Post-Execution Validation
    ↓
Evidence
```

Execution completion SHALL NOT automatically prove intended outcome.

---

## 41. Structured Automation Revision

Automation SHOULD produce machine-readable results where practical.

Potential fields include:

```text
status
action
target
started_at
completed_at
duration
validation_result
failure_type
correlation_id
```

Human-readable output may coexist with structured output.

---

## 42. Operational Validation Revision

Operational validation may include:

* static validation;
* configuration validation;
* provisioning validation;
* startup validation;
* dependency validation;
* health validation;
* readiness validation;
* runtime validation;
* security validation;
* recovery validation;
* rollback validation;
* functional validation.

Validation SHALL produce evidence appropriate to the decision it supports.

---

## 43. Testing Boundary Revision

EPIC-TST-001 remains authoritative for general testing architecture.

EPIC-OPS-001 defines operations-specific testing requirements.

---

## 44. Quality Boundary Revision

EPIC-QLT-001 remains authoritative for quality governance.

Operations may provide evidence concerning:

* reliability;
* recoverability;
* runtime stability;
* performance;
* operational correctness.

---

## 45. Build Boundary Revision

EPIC-BLD-001 remains authoritative for build engineering.

Operations consumes validated artifacts and SHALL NOT silently alter them in ways that invalidate provenance or integrity.

---

## 46. Release Boundary Revision

EPIC-REL-001 remains authoritative for release engineering.

Operations may participate in:

* deployment;
* activation;
* readiness validation;
* runtime validation;
* rollback;
* recovery.

Operations SHALL NOT redefine general release lifecycle semantics.

---

## 47. Observability Boundary Revision

EPIC-OBS-001 remains authoritative for observability architecture.

Operations consumes observability signals but SHALL NOT redefine canonical telemetry contracts.

---

## 48. Security Boundary Revision

EPIC-SEC-001 remains authoritative for security architecture and policy.

Operations consumes security controls but SHALL NOT redefine their authoritative semantics.

---

## 49. Historical Validation State

The historical numbered baseline may contain pre-publication or validation-example states such as:

```text
PENDING
Ready for Final Validation
Implementation Status: Pending
```

These SHALL be interpreted in their historical context.

They SHALL NOT automatically determine the current normalized control-layer state.

---

## 50. Historical Text Defects

The historical numbered baseline may also contain textual join defects introduced before publication.

Examples observed during current audit include:

```text
bya
appropriatvalidation
requirerewriting
withstructured
logicSHOULD
whenthe
failurebehavior
```

These defects belong to the historical numbered baseline.

The current control-document normalization SHALL classify them without silently rewriting the historical documents.

Any correction to historical numbered content SHALL be separately governed.

---

## 51. Historical Release Completion

Version `5.1.0` was historically completed and published under:

```text
v5.1.0-operations-framework
```

The tag resolves to:

```text
1e4104000f719a030b1ae72839708e0a877960d1
```

The framework is therefore historically published.

---

## 52. Post-Release Governance Evolution

After publication, the FamilyOS framework-governance model evolved.

Later normalized EPICs use seven standard control documents:

```text
EPIC-<ID>.md
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

EPIC-OPS-001 did not contain this layer in its original publication.

---

## 53. Post-Release Normalization

The current normalization adds:

```text
EPIC-OPS-001.md
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

These documents improve:

* machine-readable metadata;
* repository inventory;
* navigation;
* validation evidence;
* revision tracking;
* historical-state clarity;
* lifecycle visibility.

---

## 54. Current Repository Structure

The normalized repository contains:

```text
10 numbered documents
+
7 control documents
=
17 canonical files
```

Current canonical range remains:

```text
00 → 09
```

---

## 55. Historical vs Current Structure

Historical release:

```text
Numbered Documents: 10
Control Documents:    0
Historical Files:    10
```

Current normalized repository:

```text
Numbered Documents: 10
Control Documents:    7
Canonical Files:     17
```

The current state SHALL NOT be retroactively attributed to the historical publication.

---

## 56. Machine-Readable Normalization

The current normalization introduces:

```text
EPIC.yaml
```

as the machine-readable framework contract.

It records:

* EPIC identity;
* framework version;
* deliverables;
* current structure;
* historical structure;
* publication identity;
* validation state;
* governance;
* framework boundaries;
* closure state.

---

## 57. Manifest Normalization

The normalization introduces:

```text
MANIFEST.md
```

as the authoritative current repository inventory.

---

## 58. Validation Normalization

The normalization introduces:

```text
VALIDATION.md
```

as the authoritative record for current revalidation requirements and evidence.

It distinguishes historical publication evidence from current repository evidence.

---

## 59. Changelog Normalization

The normalization introduces:

```text
CHANGELOG.md
```

to preserve:

* historical version `5.1.0`;
* current repository normalization;
* future framework revisions.

---

## 60. README Normalization

The normalization introduces:

```text
README.md
```

as the human-readable navigation and orientation layer.

It does not replace the normative numbered framework documents.

---

## 61. EPIC Control Summary

The normalization introduces:

```text
EPIC-OPS-001.md
```

as the consolidated control-level summary.

---

## 62. Current Validation State

Current repository revalidation state:

```text
Repository Validation: Validated
Final Revalidation:     Validated
```

This state SHALL remain pending until actual current repository evidence is recorded.

---

## 63. Current Revalidation Scope

Current revalidation includes:

```text
YAML Parse
YAML Contract
Filesystem Contract
Numbering Integrity
Control Document Integrity
Empty File Validation
Manifest Synchronization
README Synchronization
EPIC Summary Synchronization
Changelog Synchronization
Revision History Synchronization
State Consistency
Reference Integrity
Placeholder Validation
Join Defect Validation
Historical Join-Defect Classification
Operations Principle Consistency
Operations Architecture Consistency
Infrastructure Neutrality
Ownership Consistency
Controlled Change Consistency
Runtime Configuration Consistency
Runtime State Consistency
Service Management Consistency
Health Consistency
Readiness Consistency
Dependency Consistency
Incident Response Consistency
Incident Evidence Consistency
Recovery Consistency
Restore Validation Consistency
Rollback Consistency
Capacity Consistency
Performance Consistency
Reliability Consistency
Operational Security Consistency
Operational Governance Consistency
Operations Automation Consistency
Automation Security Consistency
Automation Validation Consistency
Structured Automation Result Consistency
Infrastructure-as-Code Consistency
Framework Boundaries
Historical Tag Integrity
Ruff
MyPy
Pytest
Diff Check
Remote Branch Verification
Final Repository Cleanliness
```

---

## 64. Validation Evidence Policy

The required sequence is:

```text
Execute
    ↓
Observe
    ↓
Evaluate
    ↓
Record
```

Historical evidence does not automatically prove current normalized repository state.

---

## 65. Historical Evidence Already Established

The following historical evidence has already been established:

```text
Historical Tag Exists:          PASS
Annotated Tag:                  PASS
Historical Commit Identified:   PASS
Local Tag Target:               PASS
Remote Tag Target:              PASS
Local/Remote Tag Match:         PASS
Historical File Count:          PASS — 10
Historical Control Count:       PASS — 0
```

This proves historical publication integrity.

---

## 66. Current Repository Evidence

Current repository evidence remains to be collected after all seven control documents are physically present and synchronized.

Until then:

```text
Repository Validation: Validated
Final Revalidation:     Validated
```

---

## 67. Revision Classification

Future Operations Framework changes may be classified as follows.

### Editorial

Examples:

* spelling;
* grammar;
* formatting;
* non-semantic clarification.

Typical semantic-version impact:

```text
Usually none
```

---

### Repository Normalization

Examples:

* control-document addition;
* manifest synchronization;
* machine-readable metadata;
* lifecycle-state normalization;
* validation evidence.

Typical semantic-version impact:

```text
Usually none
```

when normative operations semantics remain unchanged.

---

### Compatible Semantic Change

Examples:

* additional optional operational metadata;
* compatible lifecycle extensions;
* compatible recovery profiles;
* compatible automation outputs.

Potential version impact:

```text
MINOR
```

subject to FamilyOS governance.

---

### Breaking Semantic Change

Examples:

* incompatible runtime-state contracts;
* incompatible recovery semantics;
* incompatible operational authority model;
* incompatible mandatory automation contracts;
* incompatible operational security requirements.

Potential version impact:

```text
MAJOR
```

subject to governance.

---

## 68. Historical State Policy

Historical lifecycle states may remain when clearly identified as historical.

Examples include:

```text
Implementation Status: Pending
Framework Status: Ready for Final Validation
PENDING
```

when they represent historical workflow or examples.

They SHALL NOT automatically become active current repository states.

---

## 69. Current State Policy

Current control documents SHALL distinguish:

```text
Historical Framework Publication
```

from:

```text
Current Repository Revalidation
```

The historical publication is complete.

Only current normalized repository validation remains pending.

---

## 70. Repository Completion Conditions

Current normalization becomes technically validated only when:

* all seventeen canonical files exist;
* all ten numbered documents remain present;
* numbered sequence remains exactly `00–09`;
* all seven control documents exist;
* YAML parsing passes;
* filesystem contract passes;
* numbering passes;
* no canonical file is empty;
* manifest synchronization passes;
* references pass;
* active placeholders are absent;
* historical text defects are correctly classified;
* no new control-document join defects exist;
* operations semantic checks pass;
* historical tag integrity remains valid;
* Ruff passes;
* MyPy passes;
* Pytest passes;
* `git diff --check` passes.

---

## 71. Post-Release Correction Conditions

The normalization workflow becomes fully complete when:

* normalization files are staged;
* staged content is validated;
* a normalization commit is created;
* post-commit quality gates pass;
* the normalization commit is pushed;
* authoritative remote branch matches local HEAD;
* historical tag remains unchanged locally and remotely;
* final repository state is clean.

---

## 72. Future Operations Framework Evolution

Future revisions may introduce:

* formal runtime-state schemas;
* operational policy schemas;
* machine-readable incident classifications;
* recovery profiles;
* service-level objectives;
* capacity models;
* reliability targets;
* automation policy validation;
* infrastructure adapters;
* operational governance automation.

Future revisions SHALL preserve historical version `5.1.0` publication evidence.

## 74. Current Validation Evidence Status

Historical publication evidence is established.

Current normalized repository evidence remains pending.

The authoritative current validation evidence belongs in:

```text
VALIDATION.md
```

Until current evidence is complete, this revision history SHALL NOT claim final repository revalidation success.

---

## 75. Final Revision Principle

EPIC-OPS-001 version `5.1.0` established the canonical FamilyOS Operations Framework.

Its historical publication consists of:

```text
10 numbered documents
0 control documents
10 historical files
```

under:

```text
v5.1.0-operations-framework
```

at:

```text
1e4104000f719a030b1ae72839708e0a877960d1
```

The current repository normalization adds seven control documents without rewriting that history.

Future framework evolution SHALL preserve:

* explicit ownership;
* controlled change;
* validated configuration;
* observable operation;
* structured incident response;
* recoverability;
* evidence-based capacity management;
* measurable performance;
* reliability;
* operational security;
* infrastructure neutrality;
* automation with validation;
* historical release integrity.
