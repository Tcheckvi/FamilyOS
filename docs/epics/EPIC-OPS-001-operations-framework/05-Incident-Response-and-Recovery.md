# Operations Framework

## EPIC-OPS-001

### Incident Response and Recovery

### Overview

This document defines the FamilyOS incident-response and recovery model.

Incidents are treated as operational conditions that materially affect the ability of FamilyOS to perform expected responsibilities or protect important information.

The purpose of incident response is not simply to record that a failure occurred.

It is to establish a repeatable process for:

* detecting significant operational failure;
* assessing impact;
* containing damage;
* restoring acceptable operation;
* verifying recovery;
* preserving useful evidence;
* learning from the event.

Recovery is treated as an engineering capability.

A recovery action is not considered complete until the resulting system state has been verified.

---

## Objectives

The incident-response and recovery model must:

* define what constitutes an incident;
* establish severity and prioritization;
* distinguish incidents from routine failures;
* define incident states;
* establish containment principles;
* provide recovery strategies;
* define verification requirements;
* support rollback and restore;
* integrate security incidents;
* preserve operational evidence;
* support automation;
* feed lessons back into engineering.

---

## Incident Definition

An incident is an operational event or condition that causes, or threatens to cause, meaningful impact to FamilyOS.

Examples may include:

* critical capability unavailable;
* repeated operational failure;
* corrupted persistent state;
* security compromise;
* unavailable critical dependency;
* failed release;
* major performance degradation;
* invalid production configuration;
* persistent health failure;
* unrecoverable plugin malfunction.

Not every error is an incident.

---

## Event, Failure, Alert, and Incident

FamilyOS distinguishes between several related concepts.

```text
Event
  ↓
Something occurred.

Failure
  ↓
An operation did not complete as expected.

Alert
  ↓
A condition requires attention.

Incident
  ↓
The condition requires managed operational response.
```

An individual failed request does not necessarily create an incident.

Repeated or high-impact failures may.

---

## Incident Trigger

An incident may be triggered by:

* health-state transitions;
* alerts;
* security findings;
* failed deployment verification;
* persistent error-rate increase;
* operator observation;
* failed recovery;
* data-integrity findings;
* critical dependency failure.

Trigger mechanisms should remain structured where practical.

---

## Incident Lifecycle

The FamilyOS incident lifecycle is:

```text
Detection
   ↓
Assessment
   ↓
Classification
   ↓
Containment
   ↓
Mitigation
   ↓
Recovery
   ↓
Verification
   ↓
Resolution
   ↓
Review
   ↓
Improvement
```

The lifecycle should remain proportional to incident severity.

---

## Detection

Detection identifies that an operational condition may require managed response.

Detection sources may include:

```text
Health
Metrics
Logs
Traces
Security Events
Release Validation
Human Observation
```

Detection must rely on the existing Observability Framework wherever possible.

---

## Assessment

Assessment determines:

* what happened;
* what is affected;
* whether impact is ongoing;
* whether data or security is involved;
* whether the condition is expanding;
* whether immediate containment is required.

Assessment should prioritize understanding enough to act safely.

Perfect diagnosis is not required before containment.

---

## Classification

Incidents SHOULD be classified according to useful operational dimensions.

Possible dimensions include:

```text
Severity
Category
Affected Component
Security Impact
Data Impact
Availability Impact
Recovery Complexity
```

Classification improves consistent response.

---

## Incident Categories

A compact incident-category model may include:

```text
AVAILABILITY
PERFORMANCE
DATA
SECURITY
CONFIGURATION
DEPENDENCY
RELEASE
PLUGIN
INTEGRATION
UNKNOWN
```

Additional categories should only be introduced when they improve operational decision-making.

---

## Severity Model

FamilyOS uses a lightweight incident-severity model:

```text
LOW
MEDIUM
HIGH
CRITICAL
```

Severity reflects operational impact and urgency rather than technical novelty.

---

## LOW Severity

A low-severity incident may include:

* minor degradation;
* non-critical capability failure;
* limited user impact;
* easily recoverable local condition.

Low-severity incidents may not require immediate interruption of other work.

---

## MEDIUM Severity

A medium-severity incident may include:

* degraded important capability;
* persistent non-critical failure;
* limited data-risk condition;
* repeated operational errors.

Response should be timely and deliberate.

---

## HIGH Severity

A high-severity incident may include:

* important service unavailable;
* major workflow failure;
* significant data-integrity concern;
* persistent release failure;
* serious plugin or dependency failure.

High-severity incidents normally require immediate focused response.

---

## CRITICAL Severity

A critical incident may involve:

* exposure of sensitive family data;
* active security compromise;
* severe data corruption;
* platform-wide outage;
* loss of access to critical data;
* compromised release integrity;
* failed recovery from major incident.

Critical incidents require urgent containment and controlled recovery.

---

## Severity Factors

Severity SHOULD consider:

```text
Impact
Scope
Urgency
Security
Data Sensitivity
Recoverability
Duration
```

The highest technical error count does not automatically imply the highest severity.

---

## Incident Identity

Significant incidents SHOULD receive a stable identifier.

A conceptual format may be:

```text
INC-YYYY-NNNN
```

The exact identifier format is an implementation decision.

Incident identity allows correlation across:

* logs;
* alerts;
* recovery actions;
* security events;
* post-incident review.

---

## Incident State Model

A conceptual state model is:

```text
OPEN
  ↓
INVESTIGATING
  ↓
CONTAINING
  ↓
MITIGATING
  ↓
RECOVERING
  ↓
RESOLVED
  ↓
CLOSED
```

Not every implementation requires each state as a formal persisted enum.

The model exists to make response progression explicit.

---

## OPEN

An incident is `OPEN` once a condition has been accepted as requiring managed response.

---

## INVESTIGATING

`INVESTIGATING` means evidence is being collected and the likely cause or scope is being assessed.

---

## CONTAINING

`CONTAINING` means actions are focused on limiting ongoing damage or expansion.

---

## MITIGATING

`MITIGATING` means actions reduce immediate operational impact without necessarily restoring the ideal final state.

---

## RECOVERING

`RECOVERING` means the system is being returned toward the desired operational state.

---

## RESOLVED

`RESOLVED` means acceptable operational state has been restored and verified.

---

## CLOSED

`CLOSED` means response and required follow-up have been completed.

Closure may occur after review and corrective actions are captured.

---

## Containment

Containment limits incident impact before complete resolution.

Potential containment actions include:

```text
Disable Plugin
Disable Integration
Reject New Work
Revoke Credential
Isolate Component
Stop Worker
Block Capability
Freeze Configuration Change
```

Containment should preserve evidence where practical.

---

## Containment Principle

The preferred strategy is:

```text
Stop Damage
    ↓
Preserve Evidence
    ↓
Stabilize System
```

before making broad destructive changes.

---

## Security Incident Containment

Security incidents may require stronger containment actions.

Examples include:

* credential revocation;
* secret rotation;
* integration isolation;
* plugin disablement;
* access restriction;
* release rollback.

Such actions MUST follow Security Framework controls.

---

## Mitigation

Mitigation reduces operational impact without necessarily correcting the root cause.

Examples include:

```text
Disable optional feature
Use fallback dependency
Reduce workload
Route around failing integration
Temporarily restrict capability
```

Mitigation may provide time for safer recovery.

---

## Recovery

Recovery restores FamilyOS toward an acceptable operational state.

Recovery may include:

* restarting;
* reconfiguration;
* dependency restoration;
* rollback;
* data restoration;
* plugin isolation;
* credential rotation;
* state repair.

Recovery strategy must match the failure mode.

---

## Recovery Principle

FamilyOS follows:

> Diagnose enough to choose the correct recovery action; do not use restart as the universal answer.

Restart may be appropriate.

It must not replace understanding when repeated failure is likely.

---

## Recovery Strategy Selection

A recovery strategy SHOULD consider:

```text
Failure Type
Impact
Data State
Security State
Dependency State
Release State
Reversibility
```

---

## Restart

Restart may be appropriate for:

* transient runtime corruption;
* failed initialization after dependency recovery;
* process-level deadlock;
* temporary resource condition.

Restart SHOULD NOT be repeatedly automated without understanding persistent failure.

---

## Retry

Retry may be appropriate for transient operations.

Retries MUST be:

* bounded;
* safe regarding duplicate effects;
* observable.

A persistent failing operation should escalate rather than retry forever.

---

## Reconfiguration

Reconfiguration is appropriate when failure results from invalid or unsuitable runtime configuration.

The sequence is:

```text
Identify Configuration Problem
        ↓
Prepare Corrected Configuration
        ↓
Validate
        ↓
Authorize
        ↓
Apply
        ↓
Verify
```

---

## Dependency Restoration

If a critical dependency fails, recovery may involve restoring that dependency rather than changing FamilyOS itself.

The runtime should verify dependency health before declaring recovery.

---

## Plugin Isolation

A malfunctioning non-critical plugin may be isolated.

```text
Plugin Failure
      ↓
Disable / Isolate
      ↓
Re-evaluate Runtime
      ↓
Core Continues
```

This supports failure containment.

---

## Rollback

Rollback restores a previously approved software release or configuration state.

Rollback is appropriate when a recent change is strongly associated with the incident.

The Release Framework remains authoritative for release rollback.

---

## Rollback Flow

```text
Incident
   ↓
Release Suspected
   ↓
Rollback Decision
   ↓
Select Previous Approved Artifact
   ↓
Deploy
   ↓
Readiness Validation
   ↓
Functional Validation
   ↓
Rollback Verified
```

---

## Configuration Rollback

Configuration changes may also require rollback.

Configuration rollback should restore a known valid state.

It must still undergo security and runtime validation.

---

## Restore

Restore recovers persistent information from a protected backup or other validated source.

Restore may be required for:

* corruption;
* accidental deletion;
* infrastructure failure;
* failed migration.

Restore operations may be destructive and require strong authorization.

---

## Restore Is Not Recovery Until Verified

The sequence is:

```text
Restore
   ↓
Integrity Validation
   ↓
Runtime Startup
   ↓
Health Validation
   ↓
Functional Validation
   ↓
Recovery Confirmed
```

A completed restore command does not prove successful recovery.

---

## Backup Relationship

Backup and recovery are related but separate capabilities.

```text
Backup Creation
      ≠
Recovery Capability
```

A useful backup strategy requires validated restore procedures.

---

## Recovery Verification

Every meaningful recovery action SHOULD define verification criteria before execution where practical.

Verification may include:

* health state;
* readiness;
* successful critical operation;
* dependency health;
* security control status;
* absence of recurring errors;
* data-integrity checks.

---

## Verification Levels

Recovery verification may occur at multiple levels:

```text
Operational
Functional
Data
Security
```

The required level depends on incident type.

---

## Operational Verification

Operational verification asks:

```text
Is the runtime healthy?
Is it ready?
Are dependencies available?
```

---

## Functional Verification

Functional verification asks:

```text
Can the affected capability perform its intended responsibility?
```

---

## Data Verification

Data verification asks:

```text
Is expected data present?
Is integrity preserved?
Did restoration introduce inconsistency?
```

---

## Security Verification

Security verification asks:

```text
Are security controls active?
Were compromised credentials revoked?
Are protected boundaries restored?
```

---

## Failed Recovery

Recovery attempts may fail.

A failed recovery SHOULD:

* preserve the incident;
* produce evidence;
* update severity if needed;
* prevent false resolution;
* trigger reconsideration of recovery strategy.

---

## Recovery Escalation

A simple escalation model is:

```text
Initial Recovery
      ↓
Fails
      ↓
Alternative Recovery
      ↓
Fails
      ↓
Rollback / Restore / Isolation
      ↓
Further Escalation
```

Escalation should remain controlled.

---

## Incident Commander Concept

For significant incidents, one actor SHOULD coordinate response decisions.

This role may be referred to conceptually as an incident coordinator.

Responsibilities may include:

* maintaining current incident state;
* coordinating actions;
* preventing conflicting changes;
* ensuring verification occurs.

In a small project, one person may perform all incident roles.

---

## Parallel Changes During Incident

Uncoordinated changes during incidents can obscure causality.

High-severity incident response SHOULD minimize unrelated runtime changes.

The principle is:

```text
Stabilize
   ↓
Change Deliberately
   ↓
Observe Result
```

---

## Incident Timeline

Significant incidents SHOULD maintain enough timing information to reconstruct major events.

A timeline may include:

```text
Detection Time
First Impact
Containment
Recovery Action
Recovery Confirmation
Resolution
```

Exact minute-by-minute documentation is unnecessary for minor incidents.

---

## Operational Evidence

Incident response should preserve relevant evidence.

Potential sources include:

* runtime version;
* configuration identity;
* health state;
* metrics;
* traces;
* logs;
* security events;
* release metadata;
* dependency status;
* actions executed.

Evidence must respect privacy and security requirements.

---

## Evidence Preservation

Response actions SHOULD avoid destroying useful diagnostic evidence unnecessarily.

For example, restarting before collecting relevant in-memory diagnostics may make root cause harder to determine.

Evidence preservation should remain proportional to severity.

---

## Evidence Integrity

Where incident evidence influences security, compliance, or release decisions, it SHOULD be sufficiently trustworthy for that purpose.

The system must not fabricate successful recovery evidence.

---

## Communication

Significant incidents may require communication to affected stakeholders.

Operational communication should be:

* accurate;
* concise;
* based on known facts;
* updated when understanding changes.

FamilyOS does not require a large incident-communication organization at this stage.

---

## Incident Privacy

Incident records must not become uncontrolled repositories of private family information.

Incident documentation SHOULD focus on:

* operational conditions;
* affected components;
* security impact;
* recovery actions.

Private content should be minimized.

---

## Incident Security

Incident-management interfaces and records may contain sensitive operational information.

Access should follow Security Framework principles.

---

## Incident and Observability Correlation

Where possible, incident records should correlate with runtime evidence.

Conceptually:

```text
incident_id
   │
   ├── alerts
   ├── traces
   ├── logs
   ├── health events
   └── recovery actions
```

This supports coherent diagnosis.

---

## Security Incidents

Security incidents are operational incidents with security consequences.

Examples include:

* credential compromise;
* unauthorized access;
* malicious plugin behavior;
* integrity violation;
* secret exposure;
* compromised dependency.

Security Framework threat and risk models remain authoritative for security classification.

---

## Security Incident Response

A security incident may require:

```text
Detect
  ↓
Contain
  ↓
Revoke / Isolate
  ↓
Assess Exposure
  ↓
Recover
  ↓
Verify Security
  ↓
Review
```

Recovery must not restore availability while leaving the security compromise active.

---

## Data Incidents

Data incidents may involve:

* corruption;
* deletion;
* inconsistent state;
* failed migration;
* unauthorized modification.

Response should prioritize data integrity and preservation.

---

## Release Incidents

A release incident occurs when a newly activated release causes unacceptable runtime behavior.

Potential response:

```text
Detect Regression
      ↓
Assess
      ↓
Contain
      ↓
Rollback
      ↓
Verify Previous State
      ↓
Open Engineering Defect
```

---

## Dependency Incidents

External dependency incidents may require:

* graceful degradation;
* retries;
* fallback;
* isolation;
* waiting for provider recovery.

FamilyOS should not attempt to fix systems it does not control.

---

## Plugin Incidents

A plugin incident may be isolated from core FamilyOS where architecture permits.

Response may include:

```text
Disable Plugin
Revoke Permissions
Stop External Calls
Preserve Evidence
Validate Core Runtime
```

---

## Incident Automation

Stable and low-risk incident procedures may be automated.

Examples include:

* health-based incident creation;
* automatic evidence collection;
* known-safe plugin isolation;
* post-recovery verification;
* bounded restart.

Automation should only be introduced for procedures with well-understood behavior.

---

## Automatic Recovery

Automatic recovery MAY be appropriate when:

* failure condition is deterministic;
* recovery action is safe;
* action is reversible;
* verification is reliable;
* repeated failure is bounded.

---

## Automatic Recovery Guardrails

Automated recovery SHOULD define:

```text
Trigger
Preconditions
Maximum Attempts
Action
Verification
Failure Escalation
Evidence
```

---

## Recovery Attempt Limits

Automation MUST avoid infinite recovery loops.

For example:

```text
Attempt 1
   ↓
Attempt 2
   ↓
Attempt 3
   ↓
Escalate
```

The exact count should reflect operation semantics.

---

## Human Approval

Human approval SHOULD remain required for high-risk operations such as:

* destructive restore;
* permanent data deletion;
* critical secret rotation without rollback;
* irreversible migration repair;
* high-impact security actions.

---

## Runbooks

Repeatable incident procedures SHOULD be captured as concise runbooks where useful.

A runbook may define:

```text
Trigger
   ↓
Checks
   ↓
Actions
   ↓
Verification
   ↓
Escalation
```

Runbooks should be operational tools, not documentation for its own sake.

---

## Runbook Quality

A useful runbook should answer:

1. When should this procedure be used?
2. What evidence should be checked first?
3. What actions are safe?
4. What actions are dangerous?
5. How is success verified?
6. What happens if it fails?

---

## Post-Incident Review

Significant incidents SHOULD produce a proportional review.

The purpose is learning and improvement.

A review may identify:

* root cause;
* contributing factors;
* missing test;
* missing telemetry;
* unsafe configuration;
* missing recovery path;
* unclear ownership;
* automation opportunity.

---

## Root Cause

Root cause identifies the underlying condition that made the incident possible.

FamilyOS should avoid stopping analysis at superficial symptoms where deeper understanding is practical.

Example:

```text
Service crashed
```

may be a symptom.

```text
Unbounded memory growth caused by retry queue
```

may be closer to the cause.

---

## Contributing Factors

Incidents often have multiple contributing factors.

Examples include:

* insufficient validation;
* weak observability;
* excessive privilege;
* missing timeout;
* unclear dependency criticality;
* incomplete recovery tests.

Reviews should consider the system rather than assigning simplistic blame.

---

## Blameless Engineering Review

Incident review SHOULD focus primarily on system improvement.

Human error may be relevant evidence.

The goal is to understand why the system allowed that error to produce significant impact.

---

## Corrective Actions

Incident review may create corrective actions such as:

```text
Code Fix
New Test
Configuration Validation
New Alert
Improved Health Check
Permission Restriction
Runbook
Automation
Architecture Change
```

Actions should have clear engineering value.

---

## Preventing Recurrence

A significant incident should ideally result in at least one durable improvement when a practical improvement exists.

The preferred loop is:

```text
Incident
   ↓
Understanding
   ↓
Engineering Change
   ↓
Regression Test
   ↓
Release
```

---

## Incident Metrics

Operational maturity MAY measure incident properties such as:

* count;
* severity;
* time to detect;
* time to recover;
* recurrence.

Metrics should only be introduced when they improve decisions.

---

## Recovery Time

Recovery duration may become an important reliability measure.

Conceptually:

```text
Incident Start
      ↓
Recovery Confirmed
      =
Recovery Duration
```

Formal Recovery Time Objectives may be introduced later.

---

## Recovery Point

For persistent data incidents, recovery may involve some amount of data loss.

Future deployments may define acceptable recovery-point objectives.

EPIC-OPS-001 does not require formal RPOs before meaningful requirements exist.

---

## Incident Testing

Incident-response mechanisms SHOULD be testable where practical.

Tests may cover:

* severity classification;
* state transitions;
* recovery selection;
* failed recovery;
* recovery verification;
* plugin isolation;
* rollback coordination.

---

## Recovery Testing

Important recovery procedures should be exercised before they are needed in a real incident.

Examples include:

```text
Restore from Backup
Rollback Release
Recover Invalid Configuration
Recover Dependency Failure
```

A recovery plan that has never been tested provides limited confidence.

---

## Failure Injection

Controlled failure injection MAY be used to validate incident and recovery behavior.

Possible conditions include:

* dependency timeout;
* invalid configuration;
* repository failure;
* plugin initialization failure;
* corrupted test data.

Failure injection should be deterministic and safe.

---

## Incident and Release Integration

Incident evidence may feed Release Framework decisions.

For example, a release known to cause a high-severity incident SHOULD NOT be re-approved without relevant remediation and validation.

---

## Incident and Quality Integration

Incident findings may become Quality Framework evidence.

Recurring operational defects indicate quality gaps even if unit tests initially passed.

---

## Incident and Security Integration

Security incidents may generate:

* threat-model updates;
* new security tests;
* control changes;
* permission changes;
* secret-management improvements.

---

## Incident and Observability Integration

Incident review may reveal missing observability.

A meaningful diagnostic gap SHOULD result in targeted observability improvement rather than indiscriminate additional telemetry.

---

## Minimal Initial Incident Model

The first implementation SHOULD remain lightweight.

A suitable conceptual model includes:

```text
Incident

IncidentSeverity

IncidentStatus

IncidentCategory

RecoveryAction

RecoveryResult
```

Only required fields should be implemented.

---

## Minimal Incident Record

A minimal incident record may include:

```text
incident_id
severity
category
status
summary
affected_component
detected_at
resolved_at
```

Additional evidence may remain linked rather than duplicated.

---

## Minimal Recovery Result

A conceptual recovery result may contain:

```text
action
target
status
started_at
completed_at
verification_status
reason
```

---

## Implementation Constraints

Incident-response implementation MUST:

* use Observability Framework evidence where applicable;
* respect Security Framework authorization;
* avoid uncontrolled private-data collection;
* integrate rollback with Release Framework;
* preserve deterministic testing;
* avoid excessive workflow complexity.

---

## Operational Invariants

### Invariant 1 — Incident State Is Explicit

Significant managed failures should have identifiable incident state.

### Invariant 2 — Containment Precedes Risky Recovery

Ongoing damage should be limited before high-risk recovery where practical.

### Invariant 3 — Recovery Is Verified

No recovery action is complete until resulting state has been checked.

### Invariant 4 — Failed Recovery Is Visible

Failed recovery must not produce a false resolved state.

### Invariant 5 — Security Remains Enforced

Incident urgency does not automatically bypass security controls.

### Invariant 6 — Evidence Is Preserved Proportionally

Important incidents retain sufficient evidence for diagnosis and learning.

---

## Anti-Patterns

FamilyOS SHOULD avoid:

### Alert Equals Incident

Not every alert requires full incident management.

### Restart Until It Works

Repeated restart without diagnosis can hide persistent faults.

### Recovery Without Verification

Executing a recovery command is not proof of recovery.

### Incident as Documentation Exercise

Incident management should support action, not produce unnecessary paperwork.

### Uncontrolled Changes

Multiple unrelated changes during incident response make diagnosis harder.

### Security Bypass During Emergency

Urgency does not justify unrestricted operational access.

### Infinite Automatic Recovery

Automation must stop and escalate after bounded failure.

---

                     ↓
                 Improvement
```

---

## Success Criteria

This incident-response and recovery model is successful when FamilyOS can:

* distinguish routine errors from incidents;
* classify significant incidents;
* contain ongoing damage;
* select appropriate recovery strategies;
* coordinate rollback and restore;
* verify recovery;
* handle failed recovery;
* protect incident evidence;
* integrate security incidents;
* automate safe response procedures;
* convert incidents into engineering improvements.

---

## Expected Outcome

After implementation, FamilyOS should move from:

```text
Failure
   ↓
Ad Hoc Reaction
```

to:

```text
Failure
   ↓
Detection
   ↓
Managed Response
   ↓
Controlled Recovery
   ↓
Verification
   ↓
Learning
```

---

## Conclusion

FamilyOS cannot assume that runtime failures will always be prevented.

Its operational architecture must therefore make failure manageable.

The governing principle is:

> Detect significant failure, contain its impact, recover through the safest appropriate mechanism, verify the resulting state, and convert what was learned into lasting engineering improvement.

This model provides the incident-response and recovery foundation required for reliable FamilyOS operation.
