# Operations Framework

## EPIC-OPS-001

### Overview

The **FamilyOS Operations Framework** defines the canonical operational foundation for running FamilyOS systems, services, plugins, automation, environments, and supporting infrastructure safely and predictably.

The framework establishes operations as a first-class engineering discipline rather than an informal activity performed after development or release.

It governs the operational lifecycle across:

```text
Architecture
    ↓
Implementation
    ↓
Validation
    ↓
Release
    ↓
Runtime Operation
    ↓
Observation
    ↓
Incident Response
    ↓
Recovery
    ↓
Improvement
```

The framework is defined by:

```text
EPIC-OPS-001
```

and maintained under:

```text
docs/epics/EPIC-OPS-001-operations-framework/
```

---

## Purpose

The purpose of the Operations Framework is to ensure that FamilyOS can be operated through explicit, controlled, observable, secure, recoverable, and evidence-based processes.

The framework establishes a common model for:

* operational ownership;
* runtime management;
* service lifecycle management;
* configuration;
* dependencies;
* health;
* readiness;
* incidents;
* recovery;
* rollback;
* capacity;
* performance;
* reliability;
* operational security;
* governance;
* automation;
* validation;
* release integration.

---

## Core Principle

The central operational principle is:

> FamilyOS operation should remain explicit, controlled, validated, observable, recoverable, and proportionate to actual operational requirements.

Operations SHALL NOT depend primarily on:

* undocumented operator knowledge;
* uncontrolled manual intervention;
* implicit runtime assumptions;
* vendor-specific behavior;
* unvalidated configuration;
* unobservable state changes;
* automation that bypasses security or validation;
* infrastructure complexity without demonstrated need.

---

## Why the Operations Framework Exists

FamilyOS may progressively include:

* command-line applications;
* long-running services;
* plugins;
* scheduled processes;
* automation;
* external integrations;
* background jobs;
* persistent data;
* deployment environments;
* release pipelines;
* family-facing workflows.

Without a coherent operations model, each component could independently define:

* startup;
* shutdown;
* configuration;
* health;
* dependency handling;
* incident response;
* recovery;
* rollback;
* monitoring;
* capacity assumptions;
* automation;
* operational permissions.

This would create fragmented operational behavior.

EPIC-OPS-001 establishes a shared operational model.

---

## Operational Responsibilities

The Operations Framework governs:

```text

        ↓

        ↓

```

---

## Operations Principles

The framework establishes foundational operational principles including:

```text
Explicit Ownership
Controlled Change
Validated Runtime Configuration
Observable Operation
Recoverability
Evidence-Based Operation
Automation with Validation
Security by Default
Infrastructure Neutrality
Proportional Complexity
Repeatability
Deterministic Validation
```

These principles govern operational design and execution.

---

## Explicit Ownership

Operational responsibilities SHOULD have identifiable ownership.

Ownership may apply to:

* services;
* runtime environments;
* incidents;
* recovery procedures;
* alerts;
* operational automation;
* maintenance procedures;
* configuration.

Ambiguous ownership increases operational risk.

---

## Controlled Change

Operational change SHOULD be explicit and governed.

Examples include:

* configuration changes;
* environment changes;
* service changes;
* deployment changes;
* infrastructure changes;
* credential changes;
* maintenance actions.

High-impact changes SHOULD receive proportionally stronger validation.

---

## Validated Runtime Configuration

Critical runtime configuration MUST be validated before unsafe execution.

Invalid configuration SHOULD fail safely.

Configuration validation may include:

* schema validation;
* required values;
* value ranges;
* dependency configuration;
* security constraints;
* environment-specific requirements.

---

## Observable Operation

Important operational behavior SHOULD produce sufficient evidence to determine what occurred.

Relevant evidence may include:

* structured logs;
* metrics;
* traces;
* health results;
* runtime state;
* automation results;
* incident records;
* recovery records.

EPIC-OBS-001 remains authoritative for observability architecture.

---

## Recoverability

Failure is an expected operational condition.

FamilyOS SHOULD therefore support explicit recovery mechanisms appropriate to the operational risk.

Recovery may involve:

* restart;
* retry;
* failover;
* rollback;
* restore;
* manual intervention;
* configuration correction.

Recovery SHALL be validated.

---

## Evidence-Based Operation

Operational decisions SHOULD rely on evidence rather than assumption.

A preferred model is:

```text
Action
   ↓
Observed Result
   ↓
Validation
   ↓
Evidence
   ↓
Decision
```

A command completing successfully does not automatically prove the intended operational outcome.

---

## Automation with Validation

Repeatable operational procedures SHOULD be automated where practical.

Automation SHALL:

* validate critical inputs;
* respect authorization;
* expose failures;
* verify results;
* preserve evidence where appropriate.

Automation SHALL NOT bypass required safety controls.

---

## Security by Default

Operational processes SHALL respect FamilyOS security boundaries.

Protected actions SHOULD require appropriate authorization.

Secrets SHALL NOT be exposed through:

* automation output;
* logs;
* diagnostics;
* configuration dumps;
* operational scripts.

EPIC-SEC-001 remains authoritative for security architecture.

---

## Infrastructure Neutrality

The Operations Framework SHALL remain independent of a specific infrastructure provider.

The framework does not require a particular:

* cloud platform;
* container orchestrator;
* deployment platform;
* operating system;
* infrastructure-as-code tool;
* monitoring vendor.

Operational contracts SHOULD remain portable.

---

## Proportional Complexity

Operational infrastructure SHOULD reflect demonstrated requirements.

The framework favors:

```text
Need
  ↓
Evidence
  ↓
Requirement
  ↓
Appropriate Mechanism
  ↓
Validation
```

rather than adopting infrastructure merely because it is available.

---

## Repeatability

Operational procedures SHOULD produce consistent outcomes when executed under equivalent conditions.

Repeatability is especially important for:

* provisioning;
* deployment;
* rollback;
* restore;
* validation;
* maintenance;
* credential rotation.

---

## Operations Architecture

The framework establishes a layered operational architecture.

Conceptually:

```text
+--------------------------------------------------+
|             Operational Governance               |
+--------------------------------------------------+
| Security | Validation | Evidence | Authorization |
+--------------------------------------------------+
| Incidents | Recovery | Reliability | Capacity    |
+--------------------------------------------------+
| Runtime Management | Service Management          |
+--------------------------------------------------+
| Configuration | Dependencies | Health | Readiness|
+--------------------------------------------------+
|               Runtime Environment                |
+--------------------------------------------------+
```

This model separates operational policy from infrastructure-specific mechanisms.

---

## Runtime Management

Runtime management covers the lifecycle of operational execution.

A conceptual runtime lifecycle may include:

```text
DEFINED
   ↓
CONFIGURED
   ↓
VALIDATED
   ↓
STARTING
   ↓
READY
   ↓
RUNNING
   ↓
DEGRADED / FAILED
   ↓
RECOVERING
   ↓
READY
   ↓
STOPPING
   ↓
STOPPED
```

Exact state models may vary.

State semantics SHOULD remain explicit.

---

## Service Management

Services SHOULD have clear operational lifecycle expectations.

Operational service management may include:

* startup;
* initialization;
* dependency validation;
* readiness;
* health;
* shutdown;
* restart;
* maintenance;
* degradation;
* recovery.

A service SHOULD NOT be considered operational merely because a process exists.

---

## Configuration Management

Operational configuration SHOULD be:

* explicit;
* validated;
* version-aware where practical;
* environment-aware;
* secure;
* reproducible;
* reviewable;
* traceable when required.

Configuration drift SHOULD be minimized.

---

## Health

Health describes whether a runtime component is functioning adequately.

Potential states may include:

```text
HEALTHY
DEGRADED
UNHEALTHY
UNKNOWN
```

Health SHOULD represent meaningful operational state.

---

## Readiness

Readiness indicates whether a component can perform its intended responsibilities.

A component may be running but not ready because:

* initialization is incomplete;
* dependencies are unavailable;
* configuration is invalid;
* required migrations are incomplete;
* mandatory secrets are unavailable.

Readiness SHALL remain distinct from liveness.

---

## Dependency Management

Runtime dependencies SHOULD be explicit.

Operational dependency handling may consider:

* identity;
* connectivity;
* availability;
* compatibility;
* authorization;
* timeout behavior;
* retry behavior;
* degradation;
* recovery.

A dependency failure SHOULD not automatically create uncontrolled failure propagation.

---

## Incident Response

Incidents SHALL be handled through a structured process appropriate to impact.

A canonical lifecycle is:

```text
Detection
   ↓
Assessment
   ↓
Classification
   ↓
Containment
   ↓
Recovery
   ↓
Validation
   ↓
Closure
   ↓
Learning
```

Significant incidents SHOULD produce structured learning.

---

## Incident Classification

Incident severity may consider:

* user impact;
* data impact;
* security impact;
* service impact;
* duration;
* recoverability;
* operational scope.

Severity SHOULD influence escalation and response requirements.

---

## Incident Evidence

Incident handling SHOULD preserve evidence sufficient for:

* diagnosis;
* impact assessment;
* recovery validation;
* security analysis;
* future improvement.

Evidence SHALL remain privacy- and security-aware.

---

## Recovery

Recovery is complete only when restored state has been validated.

The framework distinguishes:

```text
Restarted != Recovered
Restored  != Validated
Recovered = Restored + Validated
```

Recovery validation may include:

* service availability;
* dependency checks;
* health checks;
* readiness checks;
* data integrity;
* configuration integrity;
* security controls;
* functional verification.

---

## Rollback

Rollback is a recovery mechanism, not an automatic guarantee of safety.

Rollback SHOULD consider:

* artifact version;
* configuration compatibility;
* data compatibility;
* dependency compatibility;
* migration state;
* security state.

Rollback results SHALL be validated.

---

## Capacity

Capacity management evaluates whether FamilyOS has sufficient resources to handle expected workload.

Capacity considerations may include:

* compute;
* memory;
* storage;
* network;
* concurrency;
* throughput;
* queue depth;
* dependency limits.

Capacity decisions SHOULD be evidence-based.

---

## Performance

Performance should be measured rather than assumed.

Relevant indicators may include:

* latency;
* throughput;
* startup duration;
* recovery duration;
* queue delay;
* dependency latency;
* resource utilization.

Performance evidence SHOULD identify the relevant runtime and build version where practical.

---

## Reliability

Reliability concerns predictable behavior over time.

Reliability mechanisms may include:

* timeouts;
* retries;
* degradation;
* isolation;
* recovery;
* rollback;
* capacity margins;
* dependency handling;
* validation.

Reliability SHALL remain compatible with security and correctness.

---

## Operational Security

Operations SHALL preserve security controls during runtime activity.

Operational security may include:

* authorization;
* credential protection;
* privileged-action controls;
* secure configuration;
* protected diagnostics;
* change governance;
* audit evidence where applicable.

Emergency operations SHALL NOT automatically imply unrestricted access.

---

## Operational Governance

Governance defines how operational actions are controlled.

Governance may cover:

* ownership;
* authorization;
* maintenance;
* privileged operations;
* emergency procedures;
* incident escalation;
* recovery approval;
* evidence requirements;
* post-action review.

Governance SHOULD remain proportional to operational risk.

---

## Automation

Operational automation may include:

* provisioning;
* configuration;
* deployment;
* service management;
* health verification;
* backup;
* restore;
* rollback;
* credential rotation;
* validation.

A preferred automation flow is:

```text
Input
   ↓
Validation
   ↓
Authorization
   ↓
Execution
   ↓
Observation
   ↓
Post-Execution Validation
   ↓
Evidence
```

---

## Structured Automation Results

Automation SHOULD produce machine-readable results where practical.

Results may include:

```text
status
action
target
started_at
completed_at
duration
validation_result
failure_type
correlation_id
```

Human-readable output may coexist with structured results.

---

## Infrastructure as Code

Infrastructure SHOULD be represented declaratively where practical.

Infrastructure as Code can improve:

* reproducibility;
* reviewability;
* version control;
* recovery;
* drift reduction;
* validation.

The framework does not mandate a specific IaC tool.

---

## Operational Validation

Operational validation may occur at multiple levels.

Examples include:

```text
Static Validation
Configuration Validation
Provisioning Validation
Startup Validation
Dependency Validation
Health Validation
Readiness Validation
Runtime Validation
Security Validation
Recovery Validation
Rollback Validation
Functional Validation
```

Validation SHOULD produce explicit evidence.

---

## Testing Integration

EPIC-TST-001 remains authoritative for general testing architecture.

Operations may require tests for:

* lifecycle transitions;
* invalid configuration;
* dependency failures;
* degraded operation;
* recovery;
* rollback;
* automation;
* incident workflows.

---

## Quality Integration

EPIC-QLT-001 remains authoritative for general quality governance.

Operations contributes evidence related to:

* reliability;
* recoverability;
* performance;
* operational correctness;
* runtime stability.

---

## Build Integration

EPIC-BLD-001 remains authoritative for build engineering.

Operations SHOULD deploy validated build artifacts without uncontrolled modification of their application contents.

---

## Release Integration

EPIC-REL-001 remains authoritative for release engineering.

Operations consumes released artifacts and participates in:

* deployment;
* activation;
* health verification;
* readiness verification;
* rollback;
* recovery;
* runtime validation.

---

## Observability Integration

EPIC-OBS-001 remains authoritative for observability.

Operations consumes:

* logs;
* metrics;
* traces;
* health information;
* diagnostic evidence;
* correlation.

Operational systems SHOULD remain diagnosable.

---

## Security Integration

EPIC-SEC-001 remains authoritative for security architecture.

Operations consumes:

* identity;
* authentication;
* authorization;
* secret protection;
* cryptographic controls;
* security validation.

Operations SHALL NOT redefine those contracts.

---

## Framework Boundaries

EPIC-OPS-001 owns:

* operational principles;
* runtime management;
* service management;
* incident response;
* recovery;
* capacity;
* performance;
* reliability;
* operational security execution;
* operational governance;
* operational automation;
* operational validation.

It does not own:

* general testing architecture;
* quality governance;
* build lifecycle;
* release lifecycle;
* observability architecture;
* security policy architecture.

## Canonical Numbered Documents

The historical Operations Framework consists of exactly ten numbered documents:

```text
00-EPIC.md
01-Context-and-Vision.md
02-Operations-Principles.md
03-Operations-Architecture.md
04-Runtime-and-Service-Management.md
05-Incident-Response-and-Recovery.md
06-Capacity-Performance-and-Reliability.md
07-Operational-Security-and-Governance.md
08-Implementation-and-Automation.md
09-Validation-and-Release.md
```

Canonical numbered range:

```text
00 → 09
```

Numbered-document count:

```text
10
```

---

## Control Documents

The normalized repository representation adds:

```text
EPIC-OPS-001.md
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

Control-document count:

```text
7
```

---

## Current Canonical Repository Structure

The normalized structure is:

```text
10 numbered documents
+
7 control documents
=
17 canonical files
```

Canonical structure:

```text
Canonical Range:       00 → 09
Numbered Documents:    10
Control Documents:      7
Canonical Files:       17
```

---

## Historical Structure

The historical publication used the compact documentation model.

Historical structure:

```text
Numbered Documents: 10
Control Documents:    0
Historical Files:    10
```

The later seven-document control layer SHALL NOT be represented as historical release content.

---

## Historical Publication

Framework version:

```text
5.1.0
```

Historical tag:

```text
v5.1.0-operations-framework
```

Historical publication commit:

```text
1e4104000f719a030b1ae72839708e0a877960d1
```

Historical publication status:

```text
Published
```

Historical tag policy:

```text

```

---

## Post-Release Normalization

The current repository activity introduces the standard FamilyOS EPIC control-document layer.

Normalization adds:

* machine-readable metadata;
* canonical inventory;
* repository validation evidence;
* revision history;
* changelog;
* navigation;
* lifecycle state.

Normalization does not redefine historical version `5.1.0`.

---

## Revalidation

The normalized repository representation must be revalidated before current control-state validation is considered complete.

Required revalidation includes:

* YAML parsing;
* filesystem inventory;
* numbering integrity;
* control-document integrity;
* empty-file validation;
* manifest synchronization;
* reference integrity;
* placeholder validation;
* join-defect validation;
* operations semantic consistency;
* historical tag integrity;
* Ruff;
* MyPy;
* Pytest;
* repository diff validation.

---

## Evidence Policy

Validation SHALL follow:

```text
Execute
    ↓
Observe
    ↓
Evaluate
    ↓
Record
```

A requirement SHALL NOT be marked PASS merely because it is documented.

Only actual evidence may establish current validation success.

---

## Final Principle

The FamilyOS Operations Framework is based on the principle that:

> FamilyOS must be operable through explicit ownership, controlled runtime state, validated configuration, observable behavior, structured incident response, recoverable failure handling, proportionate infrastructure, secure automation, and evidence-based validation.

Historical publication is preserved exactly as it occurred.

The current control-document layer adds governance and revalidation around that historical framework without rewriting its release identity.
