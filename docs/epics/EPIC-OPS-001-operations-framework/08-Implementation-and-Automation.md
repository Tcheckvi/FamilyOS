# Operations Framework

## EPIC-OPS-001

## 08 Implementation and Automation

### Overview

Implementation and automation define how the FamilyOS Operations Framework is translated from operational principles and architectural requirements into executable, repeatable, observable, and governed operational mechanisms.

Operational requirements provide value only when they can be implemented consistently.

Manual operations may remain necessary for exceptional situations, but recurring operational activities SHOULD be represented through controlled automation whenever reliable automation is practical.

FamilyOS therefore treats operational automation as engineering.

Automation MUST be:

* designed;
* reviewed;
* versioned;
* tested;
* observable;
* secure;
* recoverable;
* documented;
* governed.

The objective is not to automate every possible action.

The objective is to ensure that frequent, important, error-prone, or security-sensitive operational activities can be performed consistently with minimal ambiguity.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to establish FamilyOS requirements for:

* operational implementation;
* automation architecture;
* automation ownership;
* infrastructure automation;
* environment provisioning;
* configuration automation;
* deployment automation;
* service lifecycle automation;
* maintenance automation;
* backup automation;
* recovery automation;
* operational validation;
* runbooks;
* executable runbooks;
* workflow orchestration;
* scheduled operations;
* automation testing;
* automation observability;
* automation security;
* failure handling;
* idempotency;
* rollback;
* evidence;
* governance.

The objective is to convert operational intent into controlled executable behavior.

---

## Core Principle

The fundamental FamilyOS implementation and automation principle is:

> Repeated operational behavior should be expressed as controlled, testable, observable, and recoverable automation whenever automation reduces operational risk.

Automation MUST NOT merely reproduce undocumented manual behavior.

The underlying operational intent MUST remain explicit.

---

## Operations Implementation Model

The canonical implementation model is:

```text
Operational Requirement
        │
        ▼
Operational Design
        │
        ▼
Implementation
        │
        ▼
Automation
        │
        ▼
Validation
        │
        ▼
Execution
        │
        ▼
Observation
        │
        ▼
Evidence
        │
        ▼
Improvement
```

Each layer SHOULD remain traceable to the operational requirement it implements.

---

## Automation Objectives

Operational automation SHOULD improve:

1. consistency;
2. repeatability;
3. reliability;
4. execution speed;
5. traceability;
6. security;
7. recoverability;
8. operator safety;
9. operational evidence;
10. scalability of operations.

Automation SHOULD reduce unnecessary dependence on individual operator knowledge.

---

## Automation Is Not the Objective

Automation itself is not an operational outcome.

The desired outcome is predictable and safe operation.

A manual process MAY remain preferable when:

* execution is extremely rare;
* automation would introduce disproportionate complexity;
* significant human judgment is required;
* automation risk exceeds manual execution risk.

Such decisions SHOULD remain explicit.

---

## Automation Selection

Candidate activities for automation SHOULD be evaluated according to:

```text
Frequency
    +
Complexity
    +
Human Error Risk
    +
Security Impact
    +
Recovery Importance
    +
Operational Cost
    │
    ▼
Automation Priority
```

High-frequency and high-risk repeated operations SHOULD receive priority.

---

## Automation Categories

FamilyOS operational automation MAY include:

```text
Provisioning Automation
Configuration Automation
Deployment Automation
Runtime Automation
Maintenance Automation
Backup Automation
Recovery Automation
Validation Automation
Compliance Automation
Incident Automation
```

These categories MAY share common infrastructure.

---

## Automation Architecture

Operational automation SHOULD follow a layered architecture.

```text
Operator / Trigger
        │
        ▼
Operational Interface
        │
        ▼
Validation Layer
        │
        ▼
Authorization Layer
        │
        ▼
Automation Workflow
        │
        ▼
Execution Adapter
        │
        ▼
Target Environment
        │
        ▼
Verification
        │
        ▼
Evidence
```

Validation and authorization SHOULD occur before high-impact execution.

---

## Operational Interfaces

Automation MAY be exposed through:

* CLI commands;
* CI/CD workflows;
* scheduled jobs;
* administrative APIs;
* operational services;
* controlled scripts.

Interfaces SHOULD provide consistent semantics.

---

## CLI Automation

CLI operations SHOULD support automation-friendly behavior.

Commands SHOULD provide:

* meaningful exit codes;
* deterministic output where practical;
* non-interactive execution modes;
* clear errors;
* structured output where appropriate.

Interactive prompts SHOULD NOT prevent controlled automation.

---

## Structured Output

Operational commands MAY provide machine-readable output.

Formats MAY include:

```text
JSON
YAML
Structured Event Records
```

Machine-readable output SHOULD have stable semantics.

Human-readable output MAY coexist with structured output.

---

## Exit Codes

Automation MUST use meaningful exit status.

At minimum:

```text
0     Success
non-0 Failure
```

More detailed exit codes MAY distinguish:

* validation failure;
* configuration failure;
* authorization failure;
* dependency failure;
* execution failure.

Exit-code semantics SHOULD remain documented.

---

## Automation Ownership

Every significant operational automation SHOULD have identifiable ownership.

Ownership includes responsibility for:

* implementation;
* testing;
* maintenance;
* security;
* documentation;
* incident handling;
* deprecation.

Unowned automation creates operational risk.

---

## Automation Source Control

Operational automation MUST be version controlled where technically practical.

This includes:

* scripts;
* workflow definitions;
* configuration templates;
* provisioning definitions;
* deployment logic;
* validation rules.

Production-affecting automation SHOULD NOT exist only on individual operator machines.

---

## Automation Review

Significant automation changes SHOULD undergo engineering review.

Review SHOULD evaluate:

* correctness;
* failure behavior;
* security;
* permissions;
* idempotency;
* rollback;
* observability;
* maintainability.

High-impact operational automation MAY require additional review.

---

## Infrastructure as Code

Infrastructure SHOULD be represented declaratively where practical.

Infrastructure as Code enables:

* repeatability;
* version control;
* review;
* environment reconstruction;
* drift detection.

Manual infrastructure configuration SHOULD be minimized.

---

## Desired Infrastructure State

Infrastructure automation SHOULD describe desired state.

```text
Infrastructure Definition
          │
          ▼
Desired State
          │
          ▼
Provision / Reconcile
          │
          ▼
Actual State
```

Automation SHOULD detect significant differences between desired and actual state.

---

## Provisioning Automation

Environment provisioning SHOULD be automated where repeated provisioning occurs.

Provisioning MAY create:

* compute resources;
* storage;
* networking;
* service identities;
* directories;
* runtime dependencies;
* observability integration.

Provisioning SHOULD be repeatable.

---

## Provisioning Validation

Provisioning MUST be validated before an environment is considered operational.

Validation MAY include:

* resource existence;
* permissions;
* connectivity;
* configuration;
* security controls;
* observability.

Successful provisioning commands alone do not prove environment readiness.

---

## Environment Automation

Environment automation SHOULD maintain explicit differences between:

```text
Development
Testing
Staging
Production
```

Shared automation SHOULD be preferred where possible.

Environment-specific behavior SHOULD be represented through explicit configuration rather than duplicated undocumented logic.

---

## Environment Safety

Automation MUST clearly identify the target environment.

High-impact commands SHOULD reduce the probability of accidental execution against production.

Safeguards MAY include:

* explicit environment argument;
* environment confirmation;
* authorization;
* dry-run;
* protected workflows.

---

## Production Protection

Production-affecting automation SHOULD require stronger controls than development automation.

Controls MAY include:

* restricted credentials;
* protected branches;
* approvals;
* release gates;
* immutable artifacts;
* audit logging.

Production automation MUST NOT depend on unrestricted developer credentials.

---

## Configuration Automation

Configuration SHOULD be applied through controlled automation where practical.

Configuration automation SHOULD:

* validate input;
* apply deterministic precedence;
* preserve environment separation;
* detect unsupported values;
* report applied state.

Secrets MUST remain separate from ordinary configuration.

---

## Configuration Validation

Automation MUST validate critical configuration before applying it.

Validation SHOULD detect:

* missing values;
* invalid types;
* invalid ranges;
* unsupported combinations;
* unsafe configuration.

Invalid configuration MUST fail before unsafe activation where possible.

---

## Configuration as Code

Non-secret operational configuration SHOULD be version controlled where appropriate.

Configuration-as-code enables:

```text
Change
  │
  ▼
Review
  │
  ▼
Validation
  │
  ▼
Deployment
  │
  ▼
Traceability
```

Runtime-only emergency changes SHOULD later be reconciled with authoritative configuration.

---

## Configuration Reconciliation

Automation SHOULD compare intended and actual configuration where operationally important.

Unexpected differences SHOULD be reported.

Automated reconciliation MAY correct drift when the correction is safe.

---

## Secret Injection

Automation MAY inject secrets into runtime environments through approved secret-management mechanisms.

Secret injection MUST avoid:

* command-line leakage;
* log exposure;
* source-control persistence;
* insecure temporary files.

Automation SHOULD access only required secrets.

---

## Deployment Automation

Repeated deployments SHOULD be automated.

Deployment automation SHOULD perform:

```text
Identify Release
      │
      ▼
Validate Target
      │
      ▼
Validate Preconditions
      │
      ▼
Deploy
      │
      ▼
Verify
      │
      ▼
Observe
      │
      ▼
Accept / Roll Back
```

Deployment MUST remain connected to the authoritative release identity.

---

## Deployment Preconditions

Before deployment, automation SHOULD verify:

* target environment;
* release identity;
* artifact integrity;
* configuration availability;
* required permissions;
* dependency compatibility;
* migration requirements.

Precondition failure SHOULD stop deployment safely.

---

## Immutable Artifact Deployment

Automation SHOULD deploy validated build artifacts without modifying their application contents.

Environment-specific behavior SHOULD be provided through controlled configuration.

This preserves traceability between:

```text
Build Artifact
      │
      ▼
Release
      │
      ▼
Deployment
      │
      ▼
Runtime
```

---

## Deployment Strategies

Automation MAY support strategies including:

* direct replacement;
* rolling deployment;
* blue-green deployment;
* staged deployment.

The selected strategy SHOULD reflect:

* availability requirements;
* rollback needs;
* service architecture;
* operational complexity.

---

## Staged Deployment

High-risk changes MAY be deployed progressively.

A staged deployment MAY follow:

```text
Small Scope
    │
    ▼
Validate
    │
    ▼
Observe
    │
    ▼
Expand Scope
    │
    ▼
Validate Again
```

Automatic progression SHOULD stop when required health conditions fail.

---

## Deployment Verification

Deployment automation MUST distinguish execution from success.

Verification SHOULD confirm:

* expected version;
* readiness;
* health;
* configuration;
* required dependencies;
* critical functionality.

A completed deployment command MUST NOT automatically produce a successful deployment status.

---

## Automatic Rollback

Automatic rollback MAY be used when reliable failure criteria exist.

Rollback triggers MAY include:

* readiness failure;
* critical health failure;
* excessive error rate;
* deployment timeout.

Automatic rollback SHOULD itself be validated and observable.

---

## Rollback Safety

Rollback automation MUST understand whether the change is actually reversible.

Rollback MAY be unsafe after:

* destructive schema migration;
* irreversible data transformation;
* credential rotation;
* incompatible state changes.

Irreversible transitions MUST be explicitly identified.

---

## Runtime Automation

Runtime automation MAY manage:

* service start;
* service stop;
* restart;
* health checks;
* configuration reload;
* plugin activation;
* plugin deactivation;
* maintenance mode.

Runtime automation MUST follow `04-Runtime-and-Service-Management.md`.

---

## Service Lifecycle Automation

Service lifecycle commands SHOULD use explicit operations.

Examples include:

```text
start
stop
restart
status
health
reload
enable
disable
```

Operations SHOULD produce meaningful status and evidence.

---

## Restart Automation

Automated restart MAY recover transient runtime failures.

Restart automation MUST include safeguards against restart loops.

Controls MAY include:

* maximum restart count;
* cooldown;
* backoff;
* escalation.

Repeated restart without recovery SHOULD become an incident signal.

---

## Health Automation

Health checks SHOULD be automated.

Automated health validation MAY evaluate:

* process state;
* readiness;
* dependencies;
* error rates;
* resource pressure.

Health automation SHOULD use semantics defined by the service.

---

## Maintenance Automation

Recurring maintenance SHOULD be automated where safe.

Examples include:

* temporary-file cleanup;
* log rotation;
* dependency maintenance;
* storage cleanup;
* certificate checks;
* key-rotation workflows;
* index maintenance.

Maintenance MUST remain observable.

---

## Maintenance Windows

Automation MAY schedule maintenance during defined windows.

Maintenance windows SHOULD specify:

* affected services;
* expected impact;
* start condition;
* completion criteria;
* rollback or recovery behavior.

Scheduled time alone MUST NOT determine successful completion.

---

## Scheduled Operations

Recurring operational work MAY use scheduled automation.

Scheduled tasks SHOULD define:

* schedule;
* owner;
* timeout;
* concurrency policy;
* failure behavior;
* observability.

Scheduled operations MUST NOT silently fail indefinitely.

---

## Job Concurrency

Scheduled jobs SHOULD define whether concurrent executions are permitted.

Possible policies include:

```text
ALLOW
FORBID
REPLACE
QUEUE
```

Concurrent execution MUST NOT occur accidentally when operations are not concurrency-safe.

---

## Job Timeouts

Automated jobs SHOULD have bounded execution time.

A job that exceeds expected duration SHOULD:

* fail;
* alert;
* be cancelled;
* or enter an explicit exceptional state.

Unbounded operational jobs SHOULD be avoided.

---

## Backup Automation

Backups SHOULD be automated when backup requirements exist.

Backup automation SHOULD define:

* scope;
* schedule;
* destination;
* retention;
* encryption;
* integrity validation;
* failure handling.

Backup success MUST be observable.

---

## Backup Verification

Automated backup creation SHOULD include verification.

Verification MAY confirm:

* expected backup exists;
* backup size is plausible;
* integrity checks succeed;
* metadata is complete.

Backup creation without verification provides weaker assurance.

---

## Recovery Automation

Recovery procedures SHOULD be automated where reliable automation reduces recovery risk.

Recovery automation MAY include:

* environment reconstruction;
* data restoration;
* configuration restoration;
* service restart;
* dependency validation;
* post-recovery verification.

Recovery automation MUST NOT blindly restore compromised state.

---

## Restore Testing

Automated recovery mechanisms SHOULD be tested periodically.

A backup system SHOULD demonstrate:

```text
Backup
  │
  ▼
Restore
  │
  ▼
Validation
  │
  ▼
Trusted Recovered State
```

Successful backup generation alone is insufficient.

---

## Operational Validation Automation

FamilyOS SHOULD automate repeatable operational validation.

Validation MAY include:

* service readiness;
* health;
* configuration;
* dependency state;
* deployment state;
* backup state;
* recovery state;
* security requirements.

Validation SHOULD produce machine-readable results where practical.

---

## Validation Status

Automated operational validation MAY produce:

```text
PASS
FAIL
WARNING
NOT_APPLICABLE
INCOMPLETE
```

Status semantics MUST be consistent.

INCOMPLETE MUST NOT be treated as PASS.

---

## Preflight Checks

High-impact automation SHOULD perform preflight validation.

Preflight checks MAY verify:

* target;
* permissions;
* environment;
* available capacity;
* dependency health;
* configuration;
* release compatibility.

Preflight failure SHOULD prevent execution where continuation would be unsafe.

---

## Post-Execution Validation

Automation SHOULD verify results after execution.

```text
Execute
  │
  ▼
Verify
  │
  ├── PASS → Complete
  │
  └── FAIL → Recover / Escalate
```

Successful command execution alone is insufficient for important operational changes.

---

## Idempotency

Operational automation SHOULD be idempotent where practical.

Repeated execution SHOULD converge toward the intended state.

Example:

```text
Desired State
     │
     ▼
Run Automation
     │
     ▼
Desired State
     │
     ▼
Run Again
     │
     ▼
Same Desired State
```

Idempotency simplifies retry and recovery.

---

## Non-Idempotent Operations

Some operations cannot be naturally idempotent.

Examples MAY include:

* sending notifications;
* irreversible migrations;
* external transactions.

Such operations SHOULD use safeguards such as:

* operation identifiers;
* checkpoints;
* deduplication;
* explicit confirmation.

---

## Transactional Automation

Multi-step automation SHOULD define what happens when only part of the workflow succeeds.

Possible strategies include:

```text
Rollback
Compensation
Resume
Reconciliation
Manual Escalation
```

Partial execution MUST NOT leave important state permanently ambiguous.

---

## Checkpoints

Long-running workflows MAY use checkpoints.

Checkpoints allow automation to determine:

* completed steps;
* pending steps;
* failed step;
* safe resume point.

Checkpoint data SHOULD remain consistent with actual system state.

---

## Workflow Orchestration

Complex operational procedures MAY be represented as workflows.

A workflow SHOULD define:

* inputs;
* steps;
* dependencies;
* conditions;
* timeouts;
* retries;
* failure paths;
* outputs.

Workflow state SHOULD be observable.

---

## Workflow State Model

A baseline automation workflow MAY use:

```text
PENDING
RUNNING
SUCCEEDED
FAILED
CANCELLED
WAITING
```

State transitions SHOULD remain traceable.

---

## Dependency-Aware Automation

Automation SHOULD understand required dependencies.

A workflow SHOULD NOT proceed when mandatory dependencies are known to be unavailable.

Dependency validation SHOULD use explicit checks rather than arbitrary delays.

---

## Retry Automation

Retries MAY be appropriate for transient operational failures.

Retry policies MUST define:

* retryable conditions;
* maximum attempts;
* delay;
* backoff;
* final failure behavior.

Unlimited retries are prohibited.

---

## Backoff

Repeated retry SHOULD use appropriate backoff where failure persistence is likely.

Backoff reduces:

* dependency overload;
* retry storms;
* resource waste.

Jitter MAY be added for distributed automation.

---

## Timeout Management

Every remote or potentially blocking automation step SHOULD have an appropriate timeout.

Timeouts SHOULD distinguish:

* connection timeout;
* execution timeout;
* workflow timeout.

Timeout failure MUST produce explicit status.

---

## Dry-Run Mode

High-impact automation SHOULD support dry-run where practical.

Dry-run SHOULD display:

* intended actions;
* target;
* detected changes;
* relevant warnings.

Dry-run MUST NOT perform the destructive operation it claims only to simulate.

---

## Plan and Apply Model

Declarative automation MAY use:

```text
Current State
      │
      ▼
Plan
      │
      ▼
Review
      │
      ▼
Apply
      │
      ▼
Verify
```

The applied change SHOULD correspond to the reviewed plan where practical.

---

## Confirmation

Interactive confirmation MAY protect rare destructive actions.

Confirmation SHOULD identify:

* operation;
* target;
* environment;
* expected impact.

Automation pipelines SHOULD use explicit non-interactive authorization rather than simulated interactive confirmation.

---

## Destructive Operations

Destructive operations require stronger safeguards.

Examples include:

* data deletion;
* environment destruction;
* irreversible migration;
* credential revocation;
* backup deletion.

Safeguards MAY include:

* authorization;
* dry-run;
* explicit target;
* confirmation;
* backup verification;
* audit event.

---

## Operational Runbooks

Operational procedures SHOULD have runbooks where human execution or judgment remains necessary.

A runbook SHOULD define:

```text
Purpose
Scope
Prerequisites
Inputs
Procedure
Validation
Failure Handling
Recovery
Escalation
```

Runbooks MUST reflect actual operational behavior.

---

## Executable Runbooks

Where appropriate, repeated runbook steps SHOULD become executable automation.

A mature evolution path is:

```text
Manual Knowledge
      │
      ▼
Documented Runbook
      │
      ▼
Validated Procedure
      │
      ▼
Executable Runbook
      │
      ▼
Controlled Automation
```

Human judgment SHOULD remain where necessary.

---

## Runbook Safety

Runbooks MUST clearly distinguish:

* informational steps;
* safe actions;
* privileged actions;
* destructive actions.

Critical commands SHOULD identify expected results.

---

## Automation Testing

Operational automation MUST be tested according to risk.

Testing SHOULD cover:

* expected success;
* invalid input;
* missing dependencies;
* permission failure;
* partial failure;
* timeout;
* retry;
* rollback;
* idempotency.

Automation testing MUST integrate with EPIC-TST-001 — Testing Framework.

---

## Unit Testing

Reusable automation logic SHOULD receive unit tests where practical.

Unit tests MAY validate:

* parsing;
* planning;
* state transitions;
* validation logic;
* policy decisions.

---

## Integration Testing

Automation SHOULD receive integration tests when behavior depends on external systems.

Integration testing MAY validate:

* service lifecycle;
* storage operations;
* deployment;
* configuration application;
* backup;
* recovery.

Test environments SHOULD be isolated.

---

## Failure Testing

Automation MUST be tested for important failure paths.

Examples include:

```text
Dependency Unavailable
Permission Denied
Disk Full
Timeout
Invalid Configuration
Interrupted Execution
```

Failure behavior is part of automation correctness.

---

## Recovery Testing

Automation that claims rollback or recovery capability SHOULD test that capability.

A rollback mechanism that has never been exercised provides limited assurance.

---

## Automation Test Environments

Automation SHOULD be tested in environments representative enough to reveal meaningful operational behavior.

Production SHOULD NOT be the first environment where important automation is exercised.

---

## Automation Observability

Operational automation MUST be observable.

Important automation SHOULD emit:

* start event;
* completion event;
* failure event;
* duration;
* target;
* operation identifier;
* result.

Telemetry MUST integrate with EPIC-OBS-001 — Observability Framework.

---

## Automation Logging

Logs SHOULD identify:

```text
timestamp
automation_id
operation_id
actor
environment
target
action
result
duration
```

Sensitive values MUST NOT be logged.

---

## Automation Metrics

Useful automation metrics MAY include:

* execution count;
* success rate;
* failure rate;
* duration;
* retry count;
* rollback count;
* scheduled-job failures.

Metrics SHOULD support operational improvement.

---

## Automation Tracing

Complex multi-step workflows MAY use tracing.

Tracing SHOULD help identify:

* slow steps;
* failing dependencies;
* workflow path;
* retry behavior.

Tracing MUST respect security and privacy requirements.

---

## Automation Correlation

Every significant automation execution SHOULD have a correlation or operation identifier.

This identifier SHOULD connect:

```text
Request
   │
   ▼
Automation
   │
   ▼
Target Change
   │
   ▼
Validation
   │
   ▼
Evidence
```

Correlation improves incident investigation.

---

## Automation Security

Operational automation often possesses elevated privileges.

It MUST therefore follow EPIC-SEC-001 — Security Framework.

Automation security SHOULD include:

* authenticated execution;
* explicit authorization;
* least privilege;
* secret protection;
* controlled dependencies;
* auditability.

---

## Automation Identity

Significant automation SHOULD execute under identifiable service or operator identities.

Shared anonymous administrative identities SHOULD be avoided.

The acting identity SHOULD be visible in operational evidence.

---

## Least Privilege

Automation SHOULD receive only the permissions required for its task.

For example:

```text
Backup Automation
      │
      ├── Read Required Data
      ├── Write Backup Destination
      └── No Unrelated Administrative Access
```

Broad privileges SHOULD require justification.

---

## Automation Secrets

Secrets used by automation MUST be protected.

Automation MUST NOT:

* embed real credentials in source;
* print credentials;
* persist unnecessary secret copies;
* expose credentials through artifacts.

Credentials SHOULD be short-lived where practical.

---

## Credential Rotation

Automation credentials SHOULD support rotation without requiring uncontrolled manual changes.

Credential rotation SHOULD itself be validated.

Expired or revoked credentials SHOULD fail clearly.

---

## Supply Chain Security

Operational automation dependencies MUST be controlled.

Dependencies MAY include:

* packages;
* actions;
* plugins;
* scripts;
* container images;
* binaries.

High-privilege automation SHOULD use trusted and appropriately pinned dependencies where practical.

---

## Script Security

Operational scripts MUST validate external input.

Scripts SHOULD avoid unsafe patterns including:

* uncontrolled shell interpolation;
* execution of untrusted content;
* insecure temporary files;
* world-writable operational state.

Security review SHOULD reflect script privilege.

---

## Auditability

High-impact automation MUST produce sufficient audit evidence.

Audit records SHOULD identify:

* who or what initiated the operation;
* what operation occurred;
* target;
* time;
* result.

Auditability MUST NOT require exposing secrets.

---

## Approval Gates

High-risk automation MAY require approval before execution.

Approval SHOULD be based on:

* operation;
* target;
* risk;
* environment.

Approval MUST NOT become a meaningless routine click that provides no actual control.

---

## Separation of Duties

High-risk operational workflows MAY separate:

* change author;
* reviewer;
* approver;
* executor.

The degree of separation SHOULD reflect actual operational and security risk.

---

## Automation Failure Handling

Automation MUST fail explicitly.

Failure handling SHOULD determine:

```text
Failure
   │
   ▼
Classify
   │
   ▼
Retry?
   │
   ├── Yes → Bounded Retry
   │
   └── No
         │
         ▼
Recover / Roll Back
         │
         ▼
Verify
         │
         ▼
Escalate if Required
```

Silent failure is prohibited for significant operational automation.

---

## Failure Classification

Automation failures MAY be classified as:

```text
INPUT_FAILURE
VALIDATION_FAILURE
AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE
DEPENDENCY_FAILURE
EXECUTION_FAILURE
TIMEOUT
VERIFICATION_FAILURE
ROLLBACK_FAILURE
```

Classification SHOULD improve troubleshooting and metrics.

---

## Partial Failure

Partial failure MUST be detectable.

Automation SHOULD report:

* completed steps;
* failed step;
* remaining steps;
* current state;
* recommended recovery.

Operators MUST NOT be forced to guess what executed.

---

## Rollback Failure

Rollback itself MAY fail.

High-risk workflows SHOULD define behavior for this case.

Rollback failure SHOULD trigger:

* explicit critical status;
* incident escalation;
* state preservation;
* manual recovery guidance.

---

## Automation Recovery

Failed automation SHOULD support controlled recovery.

Recovery MAY use:

* retry;
* resume;
* rollback;
* compensation;
* reconciliation;
* manual intervention.

The appropriate strategy depends on operation semantics.

---

## Reconciliation

When automation state becomes uncertain, reconciliation SHOULD compare intended and actual state.

```text
Intended State
      │
      ▼
Compare
      ▲
      │
Actual State
      │
      ▼
Recovery Plan
```

Reconciliation SHOULD precede blind re-execution of potentially destructive operations.

---

## Incident Automation

Automation MAY assist incident response.

Examples include:

* evidence collection;
* health diagnostics;
* controlled restart;
* traffic isolation;
* dependency checks;
* rollback.

Incident automation MUST remain safe under degraded conditions.

---

## Automated Remediation

FamilyOS MAY automatically remediate well-understood failure conditions.

Automated remediation SHOULD require:

* reliable detection;
* bounded action;
* known recovery behavior;
* observable execution.

Unknown failures SHOULD NOT trigger arbitrary automated changes.

---

## Self-Healing

Self-healing MAY be used for narrowly defined failure conditions.

Example:

```text
Service Instance Failure
        │
        ▼
Supervisor Detects Failure
        │
        ▼
Controlled Restart
        │

Self-healing MUST NOT hide recurring systemic problems.

---

## Alert Automation

Automation MAY generate or route operational alerts.

Alert automation SHOULD preserve:

* severity;
* service identity;
* environment;
* relevant evidence;
* correlation information.

Automated alerts SHOULD remain actionable.

---

## Automation and Capacity

Automation SHOULD respect capacity constraints defined by `06-Capacity-Performance-and-Reliability.md`.

Operational workflows SHOULD avoid creating resource spikes through:

* excessive concurrency;
* synchronized jobs;
* uncontrolled retries;
* mass restarts.

Automation itself is operational workload.

---

## Concurrency Control

Automation SHOULD limit concurrency where simultaneous operations may create risk.

Examples include:

* deployments;
* backups;
* migrations;
* maintenance;
* recovery.

Locking or coordination mechanisms MAY be required.

---

## Distributed Automation

Distributed automation SHOULD account for:

* duplicate execution;
* network partition;
* delayed messages;
* lost acknowledgments;
* clock differences.

Exactly-once assumptions SHOULD be avoided unless technically guaranteed.

---

## Operation Identifiers

Important distributed operations SHOULD use unique identifiers.

Identifiers enable:

* deduplication;
* correlation;
* resume;
* audit;
* reconciliation.

Operation identifiers SHOULD remain stable across retries of the same logical action.

---

## Automation Versioning

Operational automation SHOULD have identifiable versions.

Execution evidence SHOULD make it possible to determine which automation version performed an important change.

This supports:

* incident investigation;
* regression analysis;
* reproducibility.

---

## Automation Compatibility

Automation SHOULD verify compatibility with:

* target environment;
* service version;
* configuration version;
* infrastructure version;
* schema version.

Incompatible automation MUST fail safely.

---

## Automation Deprecation

Deprecated automation SHOULD be removed or clearly disabled.

Legacy scripts SHOULD NOT remain available indefinitely when safer replacement mechanisms exist.

Deprecation SHOULD identify the replacement path.

---

## Automation Documentation

Significant automation MUST be documented.

Documentation SHOULD include:

* purpose;
* inputs;
* permissions;
* target;
* expected behavior;
* failure behavior;
* rollback;
* evidence;
* ownership.

Documentation MUST follow EPIC-DOC-001 — Documentation Framework.

---

## Implementation Standards

Operational implementation SHOULD follow FamilyOS engineering standards.

Implementation SHOULD prioritize:

* clarity;
* maintainability;
* testability;
* type safety where applicable;
* deterministic behavior;
* explicit errors.

Operational code MUST NOT be treated as lower-quality temporary code.

---

## Python Automation

Where Python is used for FamilyOS operational automation, code SHOULD follow repository engineering requirements.

Automation SHOULD integrate with:

* Ruff;
* MyPy;
* Pytest;
* project architecture conventions.

Operational tooling SHOULD use shared libraries instead of unnecessary duplicated scripts where appropriate.

---

## Shell Automation

Shell scripts MAY be used for narrow operational tasks.

Complex business or operational logic SHOULD migrate to more structured implementation when shell complexity becomes difficult to test or maintain.

Shell scripts SHOULD use strict failure handling where appropriate.

---

## Automation Repository Structure

Operational automation SHOULD have a predictable repository location.

A conceptual structure MAY include:

```text
operations/
├── automation/
├── deployment/
├── maintenance/
├── recovery/
├── runbooks/
├── validation/
└── configuration/
```

The exact structure SHOULD follow FamilyOS repository architecture.

---

## Automation Evidence

Significant automation executions SHOULD produce evidence.

Evidence MAY include:

* operation identifier;
* automation version;
* actor;
* target;
* start time;
* completion time;
* result;
* validation outcome;
* rollback outcome.

Evidence SHOULD be sufficient to reconstruct important operational changes.

---

## Evidence Integrity

Operational evidence SHOULD be protected from unauthorized modification.

Important evidence MAY be retained through:

* CI/CD records;
* controlled logs;
* versioned reports;
* signed records;
* immutable storage.

Evidence integrity SHOULD reflect operation risk.

---

## Implementation Validation

Operational implementation SHOULD be validated before production use.

Validation SHOULD include:

```text
Code Quality
     +
Tests
     +
Security Review
     +
Failure Testing
     +
Operational Validation
     +
Documentation
     │
     ▼
Automation Ready
```

Production SHOULD NOT be the first meaningful test of high-impact automation.

---

## Automation Readiness

Automation SHOULD be considered operationally ready only when:

* purpose is defined;
* ownership exists;
* permissions are understood;
* expected behavior is tested;
* failure behavior is tested;
* observability exists;
* recovery is defined;
* documentation exists.

Critical automation SHOULD satisfy stronger evidence requirements.

---

## Automation Quality Gates

FamilyOS MAY define automation quality gates.

Possible gates include:

```text
Tests Passing
Static Analysis Passing
Type Validation Passing
Security Validation Passing
Documentation Present
Failure Paths Tested
Required Review Complete
```

Quality gates SHOULD integrate with EPIC-QLT-001 — Quality Framework.

---

## Automation Release

Operational automation itself SHOULD follow controlled release practices.

Automation changes SHOULD be:

* versioned;
* reviewed;
* validated;
* released;
* observable.

High-impact automation SHOULD NOT change silently outside normal engineering governance.

---

## Automation Rollout

Major automation changes MAY be rolled out gradually.

A rollout MAY begin with:

* dry-run;
* development;
* testing;
* staging;
* limited production scope;
* full production.

Progression SHOULD depend on successful validation.

---

## Feature Flags for Automation

Operational automation MAY use feature flags when controlled rollout is useful.

Flags SHOULD have:

* owner;
* purpose;
* default;
* expiration or review condition.

Temporary automation flags SHOULD NOT become permanent undocumented behavior.

---

## Manual Override

Critical automation MAY require a manual override capability.

Manual override MUST be:

* authorized;
* explicit;
* observable;
* auditable.

Overrides SHOULD NOT silently disable permanent controls.

---

## Break-Glass Operations

Emergency operational access MAY require break-glass procedures.

Break-glass mechanisms SHOULD:

* be restricted;
* require strong authentication;
* generate audit evidence;
* trigger review;
* be temporary.

Emergency access MUST NOT become normal operational workflow.

---

## Implementation and Observability Integration

EPIC-OBS-001 — Observability Framework provides the telemetry architecture for operational automation.

Automation MUST use standardized observability mechanisms where available.

Automation-specific telemetry SHOULD complement rather than duplicate platform telemetry.

---

## Implementation and Security Integration

EPIC-SEC-001 — Security Framework defines security requirements for automation.

Operational automation MUST preserve:

```text
Authentication
      +
Authorization
      +
Least Privilege
      +
Secret Protection
      +
Auditability
      +
Supply Chain Integrity
```

Automation is not exempt from security because it is internal.

---

## Implementation and Testing Integration

EPIC-TST-001 — Testing Framework provides testing requirements.

Operational automation SHOULD use standardized:

* unit tests;
* integration tests;
* regression tests;
* fixtures;
* evidence.

Failure-path testing is particularly important for operations.

---

## Implementation and Quality Integration

EPIC-QLT-001 — Quality Framework defines quality governance.

Operational automation quality includes:

* correctness;
* reliability;
* maintainability;
* observability;
* security;
* recoverability.

Automation defects SHOULD participate in quality-management processes.

---

## Implementation and Build Integration

EPIC-BLD-001 — Build Framework governs build artifacts.

Operational tooling SHOULD be built through controlled build processes where applicable.

Automation MUST NOT modify validated application artifacts in uncontrolled ways.

---

## Implementation and Release Integration

EPIC-REL-001 — Release Framework governs controlled release.

Deployment automation MUST consume authoritative release artifacts and release identity.

Operational automation changes SHOULD themselves follow appropriate release practices.

---

## Implementation and Documentation Integration

EPIC-DOC-001 — Documentation Framework governs automation documentation.

Runbooks, operational procedures, automation references, and recovery instructions MUST remain aligned with implementation.

---

## Implementation and Plugin Compliance

Automation affecting plugins MUST respect EPIC-PLUGIN-002 — Plugin Compliance Framework.

Plugin automation SHOULD validate:

* plugin identity;
* compatibility;
* capabilities;
* security requirements;
* compliance state.

Automation MUST NOT enable non-compliant plugin behavior silently.

---

## Automation Governance

FamilyOS MUST govern significant operational automation.

Governance SHOULD define:

* ownership;
* review requirements;
* security requirements;
* testing expectations;
* production access;
* deprecation.

Governance strength SHOULD reflect automation impact.

---

## Automation Change Management

Automation changes SHOULD follow:

```text
Proposed Change
      │
      ▼
Impact Analysis
      │
      ▼
Implementation
      │
      ▼
Testing
      │
      ▼
Review
      │
      ▼
Release
      │
      ▼
Observation
```

Emergency changes SHOULD later receive normal review and reconciliation.

---

## Automation Exceptions

Exceptions to automation requirements MUST be explicit where significant.

An exception SHOULD define:

* affected requirement;
* reason;
* risk;
* manual alternative;
* owner;
* review condition.

Manual operation MUST NOT become an undocumented permanent exception.

---

## Automation Metrics

FamilyOS MAY track:

* automation coverage;
* execution success rate;
* failed operations;
* rollback frequency;
* manual intervention rate;
* average execution duration;
* scheduled-job reliability;
* automation-related incidents.

Metrics SHOULD support improvement.

---

## Manual Intervention Rate

Repeated manual intervention in an automated workflow SHOULD be treated as an engineering signal.

It MAY indicate:

* incomplete automation;
* unreliable detection;
* poor failure handling;
* undocumented dependencies;
* incorrect assumptions.

Automation SHOULD evolve when recurring manual correction is required.

---

## Automation Debt

Automation debt MAY include:

* fragile scripts;
* missing tests;
* manual deployment steps;
* duplicated workflows;
* undocumented automation;
* excessive privileges;
* missing observability.

Automation debt SHOULD remain visible and prioritized according to operational risk.

---

## Continuous Improvement

Automation SHOULD improve through evidence.

Improvement inputs MAY include:

* incidents;
* failed deployments;
* operator feedback;
* recovery exercises;
* execution metrics;
* security findings;
* performance data.

Repeated failure patterns SHOULD result in implementation improvement.

---

## Automation Improvement Loop

The canonical improvement loop is:

```text
Automate
   │
   ▼
Execute
   │
   ▼
Observe
   │
   ▼
Measure
   │
   ▼
Learn
   │
   ▼
Improve
   │
   ▼
Validate
   │
   └────────────► Automate
```

Automation maturity is therefore continuous.

---

## Implementation Invariants

The following implementation invariants apply across FamilyOS operations:

1. operational automation MUST have explicit purpose;
2. significant automation SHOULD have identifiable ownership;
3. production-affecting automation SHOULD be version controlled;
4. critical inputs MUST be validated;
5. high-impact operations MUST identify their target explicitly;
6. automation MUST fail visibly;
7. retries MUST be bounded;
8. remote operations SHOULD use timeouts;
9. partial failure MUST be detectable;
10. idempotency SHOULD be preferred;
11. destructive actions SHOULD use stronger safeguards;
12. secrets MUST NOT be embedded in automation source;
13. privileged automation MUST use least privilege;
14. significant executions SHOULD be observable;
15. important operational changes SHOULD produce evidence;
16. rollback claims SHOULD be tested;
17. production SHOULD NOT be the first meaningful test environment;
18. manual emergency changes SHOULD be reconciled with authoritative state;
19. automation MUST preserve security controls;
20. automation MUST continuously improve from operational evidence.

---

## Canonical Operational Automation Flow

The canonical FamilyOS automation flow is:

```text
                    Operational Trigger
                           │
                           ▼
                       Identify
                           │
                           ▼
                       Authorize
                           │
                           ▼
                       Validate
                           │
                           ▼
                         Plan
                           │
                           ▼
                        Execute
                           │
                           ▼
                        Verify
                           │
              ┌────────────┴────────────┐
              ▼                         ▼
            PASS                      FAIL
              │                         │
              ▼                         ▼
        Record Evidence           Classify Failure
              │                         │
              ▼               ┌─────────┴─────────┐
           Observe             ▼                   ▼
              │              Retry             Recover
              │                │                   │
              │                └─────────┬─────────┘
              │                          ▼
              │                       Verify
              │                          │
              └───────────────┬──────────┘
                              ▼
                           Complete
                              │
                              ▼
                            Learn
                              │
                              ▼
                           Improve
```

This flow ensures that operational automation remains controlled from trigger through evidence and improvement.

---

## Automation Maturity Model

FamilyOS operational processes MAY evolve through the following maturity stages:

```text
Level 0
Ad Hoc Manual Operation
        │
        ▼
Level 1
Documented Manual Procedure
        │
        ▼
Level 2
Scripted Operation
        │
        ▼
Level 3
Tested Automation
        │
        ▼
Level 4
Observable and Governed Automation
        │
        ▼
Level 5
Policy-Driven and Continuously Improved Automation
```

Higher maturity SHOULD be pursued where operational value justifies it.

---

## Operational Automation Readiness Model

An automation capability is ready for operational use when:

```text
Defined Purpose
      +
Known Ownership
      +
Controlled Source
      +
Validated Inputs
      +
Least Privilege
      +
Tested Success Path
      +
Tested Failure Path
      +
Observable Execution
      +
Defined Recovery
      +
Documentation
      │
      ▼
AUTOMATION READY
```

Execution capability alone is insufficient.

---

## Expected Outcomes

The FamilyOS Implementation and Automation model enables:

* reproducible operational execution;
* reduced manual error;
* controlled environment provisioning;
* consistent configuration;
* predictable deployment;
* automated service management;
* safer maintenance;
* reliable backup execution;
* tested recovery;
* explicit validation;
* secure operational workflows;
* bounded retries and timeouts;
* idempotent operations;
* observable automation;
* traceable operational evidence;
* controlled emergency procedures;
* reduced operational toil;
* continuous automation improvement.

---

## Final Principle

FamilyOS operational implementation and automation are based on the following principle:

> Automation is trustworthy only when the action it performs is explicit, the target is known, the authority is controlled, the inputs are validated, the failure behavior is understood, the result is verified, and sufficient evidence exists to determine what actually happened.

Operational automation transforms documented procedures into repeatable engineering capabilities.

Implementation provides the executable mechanism.

Validation establishes correctness.

Observability establishes visibility.

Recovery establishes resilience.

Governance establishes trust.

Together, they allow FamilyOS operations to scale without sacrificing safety, security, reliability, or operational understanding.
