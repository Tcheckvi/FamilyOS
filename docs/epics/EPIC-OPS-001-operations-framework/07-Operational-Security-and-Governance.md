# Operations Framework

## EPIC-OPS-001

### Operational Security and Governance

### Overview

This document defines the operational security and governance model for the FamilyOS Operations Framework.

Operational capabilities have privileged access to runtime state.

They may:

* start or stop components;
* modify configuration;
* inspect diagnostics;
* access operational evidence;
* isolate plugins;
* rotate credentials;
* execute recovery;
* restore data;
* initiate rollback;
* perform maintenance.

These capabilities create significant security and governance responsibilities.

EPIC-OPS-001 does not create an independent security architecture.

Operational security consumes and applies the controls established by EPIC-SEC-001 — Security Framework.

The purpose of this document is to define how those controls apply specifically to FamilyOS runtime operations.

---

## Objectives

Operational security and governance must ensure that:

* operational actions are authenticated;
* privileged actions are authorized;
* access follows least privilege;
* operational interfaces do not bypass security architecture;
* secrets remain protected;
* sensitive operational evidence is controlled;
* high-risk actions receive appropriate safeguards;
* significant changes remain traceable;
* emergency procedures remain controlled;
* automation operates within explicit authority;
* operational decisions remain auditable where necessary.

---

## Security Boundary

The operational boundary is a privileged security boundary.

Conceptually:

```text
Actor
  ↓
Operational Interface
  ↓
Authentication
  ↓
Authorization
  ↓
Policy Evaluation
  ↓
Operational Action
  ↓
Runtime
```

Operational tooling MUST NOT implicitly become a trusted bypass around this sequence.

---

## Relationship With EPIC-SEC-001

EPIC-SEC-001 remains authoritative for:

* identity;
* authentication;
* authorization;
* secrets;
* cryptography;
* trust;
* threat modeling;
* security controls;
* compliance;
* security evidence.

EPIC-OPS-001 applies those concepts to operational execution.

The relationship is:

```text
Security Framework
       ↓
Defines Security Controls
       ↓
Operations Framework
       ↓
Applies Controls at Runtime
```

---

## Operational Trust Model

Operational actions should never be trusted merely because they originate from an administrative interface.

Trust must be established explicitly.

```text
Operational Request
        ↓
Known Identity
        ↓
Authenticated
        ↓
Authorized
        ↓
Validated
        ↓
Executed
```

Administrative origin is not equivalent to authorization.

---

## Operational Actors

Operational actors may include:

```text
Human Operator

Developer

Administrator

Automation

Scheduler

Recovery Process

Deployment Process
```

Every actor should operate under an identifiable authority appropriate to its responsibilities.

---

## Human Actors

Human operational access SHOULD use authenticated identities.

Shared anonymous administrative identities should be avoided.

Human actions that materially affect runtime state should be attributable where governance requirements justify it.

---

## Machine Actors

Automation and services may perform operational actions.

Machine actors SHOULD have:

* explicit identity where practical;
* defined permissions;
* bounded authority;
* controlled credentials;
* observable actions.

Automation MUST NOT automatically inherit unrestricted administrative privilege.

---

## Authentication

Privileged operational interfaces MUST require authentication when exposed beyond a trusted local development boundary.

Authentication mechanisms are governed by EPIC-SEC-001.

Operations should consume those mechanisms rather than implement competing identity systems.

---

## Authentication Context

Operational actions may require contextual information such as:

```text
actor
authentication_method
session
environment
requested_operation
target
```

Only context required for security and governance should be retained.

---

## Authorization

Authorization determines whether an authenticated actor may perform a requested operational action.

Conceptually:

```text
Authenticated Actor
       ↓
Requested Operation
       ↓
Target Resource
       ↓
Authorization Policy
       ↓
ALLOW / DENY
```

Default-deny behavior SHOULD apply to privileged operations where practical.

---

## Operational Permissions

Operational permissions should correspond to meaningful actions.

Examples may include:

```text
runtime.read

runtime.start

runtime.stop

runtime.restart

configuration.read

configuration.change

plugin.disable

plugin.enable

incident.manage

recovery.execute

backup.read

restore.execute

release.rollback
```

The exact permission model is an implementation decision.

Permissions should not become unnecessarily granular before concrete requirements exist.

---

## Least Privilege

Operational actors SHOULD receive only the authority required for their responsibilities.

The preferred model is:

```text
Required Responsibility
        ↓
Minimum Permissions
        ↓
Operational Access
```

rather than:

```text
Operational Responsibility
        ↓
Full Administrator
```

---

## Privilege Separation

High-risk operations MAY require stronger permissions than ordinary operational observation.

For example:

```text
View Health
```

should not necessarily imply permission to:

```text
Restore Backup
```

Similarly:

```text
View Configuration
```

should not automatically imply:

```text
Change Security Configuration
```

---

## Read and Write Separation

Operational interfaces SHOULD distinguish observational access from state-changing access where meaningful.

Conceptually:

```text
Read Operations
      ↓
Observe State

Write Operations
      ↓
Change State
```

Write operations generally require stronger authorization.

---

## High-Risk Operational Actions

Examples of high-risk operations include:

* destructive restore;
* data deletion;
* privileged configuration change;
* security-control modification;
* credential rotation;
* production rollback;
* disabling critical security functionality;
* irreversible maintenance;
* modification of protected operational evidence.

Such actions require stronger safeguards.

---

## High-Risk Action Flow

A high-risk action SHOULD follow:

```text
Request
   ↓
Authentication
   ↓
Authorization
   ↓
Risk Validation
   ↓
Optional Human Approval
   ↓
Execution
   ↓
Verification
   ↓
Evidence
```

---

## Human Approval

Human approval SHOULD remain available for actions whose consequences are:

* destructive;
* irreversible;
* difficult to verify;
* security-sensitive;
* data-sensitive;
* unusually high impact.

Automation should not remove meaningful decision boundaries merely because execution can be automated.

---

## Dual Control

FamilyOS does not initially require mandatory dual-control procedures.

Future deployments MAY require multiple approvals for exceptionally sensitive actions.

Such controls should only be introduced when justified by actual risk.

---

## Operational Interfaces

Operational interfaces may include:

```text
CLI

Application API

Administrative UI

Automation Interface

Scheduled Job

Deployment Tool
```

All interfaces that perform equivalent privileged actions SHOULD ultimately enforce equivalent security policy.

---

## CLI Security

CLI commands may provide privileged operational capabilities.

A command being executed locally does not automatically make it safe.

CLI implementations SHOULD consider:

* authenticated context where required;
* authorization;
* environment targeting;
* argument validation;
* secret handling;
* evidence generation.

---

## API Security

Operational APIs MUST enforce security at the server-side boundary.

Client-side hiding or interface restrictions do not constitute authorization.

---

## Administrative UI Security

Administrative user interfaces should act as clients of secured operational services.

The preferred architecture is:

```text
Administrative UI
       ↓
Authenticated Request
       ↓
Operational API
       ↓
Authorization
       ↓
Runtime Control
```

---

## Environment Targeting

Operational actions MUST clearly identify their intended environment where multiple environments exist.

A dangerous pattern is:

```text
Operator assumes TEST
        ↓
Command targets PRODUCTION
```

Operational tooling should reduce environment ambiguity.

---

## Environment Visibility

High-risk interfaces SHOULD make environment identity obvious.

Relevant information may include:

```text
environment
runtime
release
target
```

The goal is to reduce accidental cross-environment operations.

---

## Production Operations

Production-equivalent environments SHOULD receive stronger controls than local development environments.

Controls may include:

* stronger authentication;
* narrower authorization;
* change validation;
* approval;
* increased evidence;
* protected secrets.

Security should remain proportional to actual deployment risk.

---

## Development Operations

Local development SHOULD remain efficient.

The framework does not require production-grade governance for every developer command.

However, development convenience must not silently become production architecture.

---

## Operational Secrets

Operations may require access to credentials and secrets.

Examples include:

* database credentials;
* external API credentials;
* signing credentials;
* backup encryption keys;
* administrative tokens.

Secret management remains governed by EPIC-SEC-001.

---

## Secret References

Operational configuration SHOULD prefer secret references over embedded secret values.

```text
Configuration
      ↓
Secret Reference
      ↓
Authorized Secret Provider
      ↓
Runtime Value
```

---

## Secret Exposure Prevention

Secrets MUST NOT appear intentionally in:

* ordinary logs;
* health responses;
* metrics;
* traces;
* incident summaries;
* CLI output;
* configuration dumps;
* error messages.

Where accidental exposure occurs, the event should be treated according to Security Framework requirements.

---

## Secret Rotation

Credential rotation is an operational security procedure.

A conceptual sequence is:

```text
Prepare New Credential
        ↓
Validate
        ↓
Activate
        ↓
Verify Runtime
        ↓
Revoke Previous Credential
        ↓
Record Evidence
```

The exact ordering may differ depending on credential semantics.

---

## Compromised Credentials

Suspected credential compromise may require:

```text
Detect
  ↓
Contain
  ↓
Revoke
  ↓
Replace
  ↓
Verify
  ↓
Investigate
```

Availability concerns must not prevent necessary security containment.

---

## Configuration Security

Operational configuration can change security posture.

Security-sensitive configuration includes:

* authentication configuration;
* authorization rules;
* trusted endpoints;
* secret providers;
* encryption settings;
* plugin permissions;
* external integrations.

Such changes require appropriate validation.

---

## Configuration Change Control

A security-sensitive configuration change SHOULD follow:

```text
Proposed Change
      ↓
Schema Validation
      ↓
Security Validation
      ↓
Authorization
      ↓
Apply
      ↓
Runtime Verification
      ↓
Evidence
```

---

## Configuration Integrity

FamilyOS SHOULD be able to determine whether critical operational configuration is valid.

Future implementations may additionally support integrity verification for protected configuration artifacts.

---

## Configuration Drift

Unexpected configuration drift may create security and reliability risks.

FamilyOS SHOULD minimize undocumented runtime changes.

Where practical:

```text
Intended Configuration
        ↓
Runtime Configuration
        ↓
Comparison
        ↓
Drift Detection
```

may be introduced.

---

## Operational Evidence Security

Operational evidence can contain sensitive information about FamilyOS architecture and runtime behavior.

Examples include:

* component identities;
* internal paths;
* failure details;
* dependency information;
* user identifiers;
* security events;
* configuration metadata.

Evidence must therefore be protected appropriately.

---

## Evidence Classification

Operational evidence MAY be classified according to sensitivity.

A simple conceptual model could include:

```text
PUBLIC

INTERNAL

SENSITIVE

RESTRICTED
```

Formal classification should only be introduced where it improves protection or governance.

---

## Evidence Access

Access to operational evidence SHOULD reflect its sensitivity.

For example:

```text
General Health
```

may require less privilege than:

```text
Security Incident Evidence
```

---

## Evidence Minimization

Operational evidence SHOULD contain only information useful for legitimate operational purposes.

The principle is:

```text
Operational Need
      ↓
Minimum Necessary Evidence
```

---

## Evidence Retention

Retention should balance:

* diagnostic usefulness;
* security;
* privacy;
* storage;
* compliance.

Indefinite retention is not the default.

---

## Evidence Integrity

Significant operational actions SHOULD produce trustworthy evidence of their execution and outcome.

Where stronger integrity guarantees become necessary, FamilyOS may introduce:

* append-only records;
* signed records;
* protected audit storage;
* integrity verification.

These capabilities are not required prematurely.

---

## Audit Trail

An audit trail records significant actions affecting protected runtime state.

Potential audit events include:

```text
Configuration Changed

Plugin Disabled

Credential Rotated

Recovery Executed

Backup Restored

Release Rolled Back

Authorization Changed
```

Not every read operation requires audit logging.

---

## Audit Event

A conceptual audit event may contain:

```text
timestamp
actor
operation
target
environment
result
reason
correlation_id
```

Sensitive payload values should be excluded.

---

## Audit Quality

Audit evidence should answer:

```text
Who performed the action?

What action was performed?

What was affected?

When did it occur?

Was it successful?
```

where those questions are relevant to the operation.

---

## Operational Privacy

FamilyOS operations may expose information belonging to family members.

Operational tooling MUST avoid treating private domain data as ordinary diagnostic content.

---

## Privacy by Operational Design

Operational interfaces should prefer:

```text
Identifier
State
Outcome
Metadata
```

over unnecessary reproduction of:

```text
Private Content
```

---

## Diagnostic Data

Diagnostic information SHOULD be designed to reveal system behavior without exposing unnecessary domain data.

For example:

```text
document_processing_failed
document_id=...
```

is generally preferable to logging the document contents.

---

## Personal Data in Incidents

Incident records SHOULD avoid copying private user content unless strictly required for investigation.

Where sensitive evidence is required, access and retention should be controlled.

---

## Backup Security

Backups may contain some of the most sensitive information managed by FamilyOS.

Backup operations MUST therefore consider:

* access control;
* confidentiality;
* integrity;
* retention;
* secure deletion;
* restore authorization.

---

## Backup Access

Permission to operate FamilyOS does not automatically imply permission to access raw backup contents.

Backup access SHOULD remain independently controlled where practical.

---

## Backup Encryption

Backup encryption SHOULD follow EPIC-SEC-001 cryptographic requirements where confidentiality protection is necessary.

Operations must not invent independent cryptographic mechanisms.

---

## Restore Authorization

Restore is a privileged operation because it can replace active state.

Restore SHOULD require explicit authorization.

High-impact restore may additionally require human approval.

---

## Restore Integrity

Before restoring protected data, FamilyOS SHOULD verify that the selected recovery source is appropriate and sufficiently trustworthy.

After restoration, data and runtime integrity must be validated.

---

## Release Security

Operational deployment consumes artifacts approved by the Release Framework.

Operations SHOULD NOT deploy arbitrary unapproved artifacts into protected environments.

The expected chain is:

```text
Approved Release
      ↓
Authorized Deployment
      ↓
Runtime
```

---

## Artifact Integrity

Where artifact-integrity mechanisms are provided by Build, Release, or Security frameworks, operations SHOULD verify them before activation.

---

## Rollback Security

Rollback must target a known approved artifact or configuration state.

An incident does not justify deploying an unknown artifact merely because it appears to work.

---

## Plugin Operational Security

Plugins represent important operational trust boundaries.

Operational controls may need to:

* enable plugins;
* disable plugins;
* inspect plugin health;
* modify plugin configuration;
* isolate malfunctioning plugins.

These operations must respect plugin permissions and Security Framework controls.

---

## Plugin Isolation

A compromised or malfunctioning plugin SHOULD be isolatable where architecture permits.

```text
Suspicious Plugin
       ↓
Disable / Isolate
       ↓
Revoke Relevant Access
       ↓
Preserve Evidence
       ↓
Validate Core Runtime
```

---

## Plugin Privileges

Operational tooling MUST NOT silently expand plugin privileges.

Plugin permissions remain governed by the appropriate FamilyOS plugin and security frameworks.

---

## External Integration Security

Operational management of external integrations may include:

* credentials;
* endpoints;
* connection state;
* retry controls;
* enablement;
* disablement.

These controls can affect trust boundaries.

---

## Integration Disablement

FamilyOS SHOULD support controlled disablement of risky or failing integrations where architecture permits.

This may be necessary for both incident containment and security response.

---

## Operational Network Security

Where FamilyOS exposes operational interfaces over a network, those interfaces SHOULD be protected according to their risk.

Potential controls include:

* authenticated transport;
* restricted exposure;
* authorization;
* rate limiting;
* network boundaries.

The framework remains infrastructure-neutral.

---

## Remote Administration

Remote administrative capabilities create additional attack surface.

They SHOULD only be introduced when required.

A local-only operational interface is preferable when remote administration provides no meaningful operational benefit.

---

## Threat Model Integration

Operational capabilities SHOULD be included in FamilyOS threat modeling.

Relevant threats include:

```text
Unauthorized Operational Access

Privilege Escalation

Configuration Tampering

Secret Exposure

Malicious Automation

Evidence Tampering

Backup Theft

Destructive Restore

Compromised Plugin Control

Operational Denial of Service
```

---

## Threat-Driven Controls

Operational controls should respond to meaningful threats rather than accumulate without justification.

The pattern is:

```text
Threat
   ↓
Risk
   ↓
Control
   ↓
Validation
   ↓
Evidence
```

---

## Break-Glass Access

Emergency access may eventually be required for severe operational conditions.

A break-glass mechanism MUST NOT mean unrestricted undocumented access.

If introduced, it SHOULD include:

* strong authentication;
* narrowly defined authority;
* explicit invocation;
* increased evidence;
* post-use review;
* revocation or expiration.

---

## Emergency Does Not Mean Uncontrolled

The governing principle is:

> Emergency conditions may change approval requirements, but they do not eliminate security accountability.

---

## Operational Governance

Operational governance defines how important runtime decisions are controlled.

Governance should remain proportional to:

* risk;
* environment;
* reversibility;
* security impact;
* data impact.

---

## Governance Objectives

Governance should help ensure:

```text
Right Actor

Right Operation

Right Target

Right Time

Known Risk

Verified Result
```

without creating unnecessary bureaucracy.

---

## Governance Levels

A lightweight governance model may distinguish:

```text
Routine

Controlled

High-Risk

Emergency
```

The exact labels need not become implementation types unless useful.

---

## Routine Operations

Routine operations may include:

* viewing health;
* reading non-sensitive status;
* ordinary startup in development;
* deterministic diagnostics.

These should require minimal governance.

---

## Controlled Operations

Controlled operations may include:

* production restart;
* plugin enablement;
* configuration update;
* scheduled maintenance.

These require appropriate authorization and verification.

---

## High-Risk Operations

High-risk operations may include:

* destructive restore;
* production security-policy modification;
* sensitive credential rotation;
* irreversible data repair.

These may require additional approval.

---

## Emergency Operations

Emergency operations prioritize containment and recovery while preserving minimum necessary security controls.

Emergency procedures should be predefined where possible.

---

## Change Governance

Operational changes SHOULD be deliberate.

A significant change follows:

```text
Propose
   ↓
Validate
   ↓
Authorize
   ↓
Execute
   ↓
Observe
   ↓
Verify
   ↓
Record
```

The process may be automated for low-risk deterministic changes.

---

## Change Scope

Operational change may include:

* deployment;
* configuration;
* plugin activation;
* dependency configuration;
* security policy;
* runtime scaling;
* maintenance;
* recovery.

Not every runtime event is a governed change.

---

## Change Reversibility

Before high-risk changes, operators SHOULD understand whether the action is:

```text
Reversible

Partially Reversible

Irreversible
```

Irreversible changes require stronger caution.

---

## Change Verification

Change completion requires verification of resulting state.

```text
Change Applied
      ↓
Runtime Observed
      ↓
Expected State?
      │
      ├── Yes ──► Complete
      │
      └── No  ──► Recover / Roll Back
```

---

## Operational Ownership

Operationally significant components SHOULD have identifiable ownership.

Ownership may answer:

```text
Who understands this component?

Who may approve significant changes?

Who responds when it fails?

Who owns its recovery procedure?
```

A small FamilyOS project may assign all responsibilities to one person.

The model remains valuable as the project grows.

---

## Separation of Duties

Strict separation of duties is not required for every FamilyOS deployment.

However, architecture SHOULD allow future separation between:

```text
Developer

Release Approver

Operator

Security Administrator
```

where organizational scale or risk requires it.

---

## Automation Governance

Automation is an operational actor.

It MUST operate under defined authority.

The expected model is:

```text
Automation Identity
       ↓
Defined Permissions
       ↓
Known Preconditions
       ↓
Operational Action
       ↓
Verification
       ↓
Evidence
```

---

## Automation Scope

Automation SHOULD be narrowly scoped to its intended function.

For example, an automated health recovery mechanism may require permission to:

```text
restart_component
```

without requiring permission to:

```text
restore_backup
```

---

## Automation Guardrails

Operational automation SHOULD define:

* trigger;
* scope;
* preconditions;
* maximum attempts;
* authorized actions;
* verification;
* escalation.

---

## Automation Failure

Automation failure must remain visible.

Automation MUST NOT repeatedly execute privileged actions indefinitely without escalation.

---

## Automated Security Actions

Security-related automation may perform actions such as:

* credential revocation;
* plugin isolation;
* access blocking.

Such automation requires particularly clear conditions and bounded authority.

---

## Incident Governance

During incidents, governance should support rapid but controlled action.

High-severity incidents may justify streamlined approval.

They do not justify unknown or unauditable actions.

---

## Incident Authority

Incident responders SHOULD know which actions they are authorized to perform.

Ambiguous authority during an incident can delay containment or cause unsafe intervention.

---

## Incident Evidence Access

Incident responders may require temporary access to sensitive evidence.

Such access should remain:

* authorized;
* limited;
* purpose-specific;
* revocable where practical.

---

## Post-Incident Governance

Significant incidents SHOULD review whether:

* privileges were appropriate;
* emergency procedures were used;
* evidence was sufficient;
* security controls impeded or enabled safe response;
* additional controls are justified.

---

## Compliance Integration

Operational controls may contribute to FamilyOS compliance evidence.

Examples include:

```text
Authorized Change Evidence

Recovery Verification

Access Control Evidence

Incident Evidence

Configuration Validation

Backup Validation
```

Compliance evidence should reuse existing framework artifacts where possible.

---

## Policy as Code

Operational governance rules MAY eventually be represented as executable policy.

Examples include:

```text
Who may deploy?

Who may restore?

Which artifacts may run?

Which environments may an actor modify?
```

Policy automation should only be introduced when requirements are stable enough to justify it.

---

## Governance Automation

Stable governance checks SHOULD be candidates for automation.

Examples include:

* artifact approval validation;
* configuration schema validation;
* permission checks;
* environment checks;
* required recovery verification.

Human approval should remain where judgment is necessary.

---

## Security Validation

Operational security controls SHOULD be validated through testing.

Tests may include:

* unauthorized action rejection;
* privilege boundaries;
* secret redaction;
* configuration validation;
* plugin isolation;
* restore authorization;
* automation permission limits.

---

## Negative Testing

Security testing should include prohibited behavior.

Examples:

```text
Unauthenticated actor attempts privileged action
        ↓
DENY
```

```text
Authorized reader attempts configuration change
        ↓
DENY
```

```text
Operational diagnostic attempts to expose secret
        ↓
REDACT / DENY
```

---

## Governance Validation

Governance validation may verify that:

* required approvals exist;
* high-risk actions are classified correctly;
* actions target intended environments;
* rollback paths exist;
* resulting state is verified.

---

## Security Failure Behavior

When an operational security check fails, FamilyOS SHOULD fail safely.

The expected pattern is:

```text
Security Validation Failure
        ↓
Operational Action Rejected
        ↓
Evidence
```

not:

```text
Security Validation Failure
        ↓
Continue Anyway
```

---

## Authorization Failure

Authorization failure MUST NOT partially execute the protected operation.

The preferred behavior is:

```text
Request
   ↓
Authorization
   ↓
DENY
   ↓
No State Change
```

---

## Governance Failure

If required governance conditions cannot be satisfied for a high-risk operation, the default should be to stop rather than silently downgrade safeguards.

Emergency procedures, if available, should be explicit.

---

## Security Observability

Operational security events should integrate with the Observability Framework.

Potential events include:

```text
authentication_failure

authorization_denied

privileged_action

secret_rotation

plugin_isolation

restore_started

restore_completed

rollback_started

rollback_completed
```

Event design must avoid exposing protected information.

---

## Security Alerting

Alerts should focus on actionable security conditions.

Examples may include:

* repeated privileged authorization failure;
* unauthorized configuration attempts;
* secret-provider failure;
* suspicious operational access;
* failed security-critical recovery.

Not every security event requires an alert.

---

## Operational Governance Evidence

Governance evidence may need to demonstrate:

```text
Action Requested

Actor Authorized

Required Conditions Met

Action Executed

Result Verified
```

Evidence depth should correspond to operational risk.

---

## Minimal Initial Security Model

The first Operations implementation SHOULD avoid creating a large administration subsystem.

The minimum viable model is:

```text
Authenticated Operational Actor
        ↓
Authorization
        ↓
Validated Operation
        ↓
Runtime Action
        ↓
Verification
        ↓
Evidence
```

This is sufficient to establish the correct architecture.

---

## Minimal Initial Governance

Initial governance SHOULD focus on:

* explicit environment;
* approved release artifacts;
* validated configuration;
* controlled privileged actions;
* verified recovery;
* meaningful evidence.

Complex approval workflows are not required initially.

---

## Future Security Evolution

Future operational maturity may introduce:

* stronger administrative identity;
* delegated administration;
* temporary privilege elevation;
* dual approval;
* signed operational commands;
* protected audit infrastructure;
* automated policy enforcement;
* richer environment isolation.

These capabilities should be driven by concrete requirements.

---

## Future Governance Evolution

Governance may evolve from:

```text
Explicit Rules
      ↓
Documented Procedures
      ↓
Automated Validation
      ↓
Policy Enforcement
```

without changing the fundamental operational model.

---

## Security Invariants

### Invariant 1 — No Implicit Administrative Trust

Operational access does not bypass authentication and authorization merely because it is administrative.

### Invariant 2 — Least Privilege

Operational actors receive only the permissions required for their responsibilities.

### Invariant 3 — Secrets Remain Protected

Operational interfaces and evidence must not intentionally expose secret values.

### Invariant 4 — High-Risk Actions Are Controlled

Destructive and security-sensitive operations require safeguards proportional to their impact.

### Invariant 5 — Security Failure Prevents Protected Action

Failed authorization or required security validation must prevent protected state change.

### Invariant 6 — Automation Has Bounded Authority

Automated operational actors must not possess unrestricted authority without necessity.

### Invariant 7 — Emergency Access Remains Accountable

Emergency procedures may accelerate action but must not eliminate accountability.

### Invariant 8 — Operational Evidence Is Protected

Sensitive operational evidence must receive appropriate access and retention controls.

---

## Governance Invariants

### Invariant 1 — Significant Change Is Intentional

Operational changes affecting protected environments should be deliberate and attributable where necessary.

### Invariant 2 — Environment Is Explicit

Significant actions should target an unambiguous environment.

### Invariant 3 — Verification Is Required

A governed operational action is not complete until its result has been evaluated.

### Invariant 4 — Governance Is Proportional

Low-risk actions must not accumulate unnecessary bureaucracy.

### Invariant 5 — Existing Frameworks Remain Authoritative

Operations must not create competing security, release, observability, or compliance architectures.

---

## Operational Security Anti-Patterns

FamilyOS MUST avoid several security anti-patterns.

### Admin Means Trusted

Administrative interfaces must not automatically bypass security.

### Shared Root Credential

All operational actors should not depend indefinitely on one unrestricted shared credential.

### Secrets in Logs

Operational convenience never justifies intentional secret logging.

### Production Debug Bypass

Temporary diagnostic mechanisms must not become permanent security bypasses.

### Unlimited Automation Privilege

Automation should not receive full administrative authority merely for convenience.

### Emergency Without Evidence

Emergency response should not become invisible operational activity.

### Restore Without Authorization

Recovery urgency does not make destructive restore safe by default.

---

## Governance Anti-Patterns

### Process for Process Sake

Governance must reduce operational risk, not simply create paperwork.

### Approval Everywhere

Routine low-risk operations should not require unnecessary approval chains.

### No Ownership

Significant operational components should not become nobody's responsibility.

### Change Without Verification

A successful command is not proof of a successful operational change.

### Unrecorded High-Risk Change

Important runtime changes should not depend solely on human memory.

### Governance Outside Automation

Automated operations must follow the same governance principles as manual operations.

## Success Criteria

Operational security and governance are successful when FamilyOS can demonstrate that:

* privileged runtime actions are controlled;
* authentication and authorization remain enforced;
* least privilege applies to humans and automation;
* operational secrets remain protected;
* sensitive evidence receives appropriate protection;
* high-risk changes receive stronger safeguards;
* emergency access remains accountable;
* runtime changes target explicit environments;
* operational actions are verified;
* security failures prevent protected actions;
* governance remains proportional to actual risk;
* existing FamilyOS frameworks remain authoritative.

---

## Expected Outcome

After implementation, FamilyOS operational control should evolve from:

```text
Administrator
     ↓
Direct Runtime Mutation
```

toward:

```text
Identified Actor
      ↓
Authenticated
      ↓
Authorized
      ↓
Validated Operation
      ↓
Controlled Runtime Change
      ↓
Verification
      ↓
Evidence
```

This establishes a secure operational control boundary without requiring excessive administrative infrastructure.

## Conclusion

Operational capabilities are powerful because they can directly alter the state of FamilyOS.

That power must remain controlled.

EPIC-OPS-001 therefore treats operational security as the runtime application of EPIC-SEC-001 rather than as an independent security subsystem.

Governance provides the complementary decision model for ensuring that significant operational changes are intentional, authorized, proportionate, observable, and verified.

The governing principle is:

> Every privileged FamilyOS operational action must execute within explicit authority, preserve applicable security boundaries, target a known runtime context, and produce a result that can be verified.

This model allows FamilyOS operations to remain secure and governable while preserving the simplicity required by the current stage of the platform.
