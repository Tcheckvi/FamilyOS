# Operations Framework

## EPIC-OPS-001

## 06 Capacity, Performance and Reliability

### Overview

Capacity, performance, and reliability define the operational engineering practices required to ensure that FamilyOS continues to function predictably under expected and unexpected workload conditions.

A system may be functionally correct while still being operationally unsuitable because it:

* consumes excessive resources;
* becomes unstable under load;
* responds too slowly;
* exhausts dependencies;
* fails during workload spikes;
* cannot recover from resource pressure;
* provides insufficient availability.

FamilyOS therefore treats capacity, performance, and reliability as interconnected operational properties.

Capacity determines whether sufficient resources exist to support workload.

Performance determines how efficiently and predictably the system responds.

Reliability determines whether the system continues providing correct service over time and through failure conditions.

These properties MUST be engineered, observed, validated, and continuously improved.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to establish FamilyOS requirements for:

* capacity management;
* workload understanding;
* resource planning;
* performance engineering;
* latency;
* throughput;
* concurrency;
* saturation;
* resource limits;
* scaling;
* availability;
* reliability;
* resilience;
* service-level indicators;
* service-level objectives;
* error budgets;
* failure containment;
* graceful degradation;
* reliability testing;
* performance testing;
* capacity forecasting;
* operational optimization.

The objective is to ensure that FamilyOS services remain usable, stable, efficient, and recoverable under realistic operational conditions.

---

## Core Principle

The fundamental FamilyOS principle for capacity, performance, and reliability is:

> Operational reliability requires sufficient capacity, predictable performance, controlled resource usage, measurable service objectives, and deliberate behavior under failure.

Performance MUST NOT be optimized independently of correctness, security, or reliability.

---

## Operational Quality Model

Capacity, performance, and reliability interact as follows:

```text
             Workload
                │
                ▼
             Capacity
                │
                ▼
            Resources
                │
                ▼
           Performance
                │
                ▼
            Reliability
                │
                ▼
        Service Experience
```

Insufficient capacity often becomes a performance problem before becoming a reliability failure.

---

## Capacity Management

Capacity management ensures that sufficient resources exist to support current and expected workload.

Resources MAY include:

* CPU;
* memory;
* storage;
* network;
* database connections;
* file descriptors;
* worker processes;
* queues;
* external API quotas;
* cache capacity.

Capacity SHOULD be based on measured or reasonably estimated demand.

---

## Capacity Objectives

Capacity management SHOULD ensure that:

1. expected workload can be served;
2. reasonable workload variation can be absorbed;
3. resource exhaustion is detectable;
4. capacity limits are understood;
5. growth can be planned;
6. emergency capacity actions are possible where necessary.

Capacity planning SHOULD occur before saturation becomes an incident.

---

## Workload Model

Operational capacity decisions SHOULD begin with a workload model.

A workload model MAY include:

```text
Users
  +
Requests
  +
Background Jobs
  +
Plugins
  +
Data Volume
  +
Integrations
  │
  ▼
Operational Demand
```

Workload models SHOULD reflect actual usage patterns where evidence exists.

---

## Workload Dimensions

Workload MAY be described using dimensions such as:

* requests per second;
* concurrent users;
* active sessions;
* jobs per minute;
* events per second;
* plugin executions;
* data volume;
* storage growth;
* external API calls.

Relevant dimensions SHOULD be selected according to service behavior.

---

## Baseline Workload

Services SHOULD identify a normal operational workload.

The baseline provides a reference for:

* capacity planning;
* performance testing;
* anomaly detection;
* scaling decisions.

Baseline workload SHOULD be updated when usage patterns materially change.

---

## Peak Workload

Services SHOULD consider expected workload peaks.

Peaks MAY result from:

* synchronized user activity;
* scheduled jobs;
* imports;
* backups;
* maintenance;
* plugin execution;
* external events.

Capacity planning SHOULD NOT assume average workload represents maximum demand.

---

## Burst Workload

Short workload bursts MAY exceed ordinary operating levels.

Systems SHOULD determine whether bursts are:

* absorbed;
* queued;
* throttled;
* rejected.

Unbounded burst handling SHOULD be avoided.

---

## Capacity Headroom

Critical services SHOULD maintain reasonable capacity headroom.

Conceptually:

```text
Maximum Safe Capacity
        │
        ├── Reserved Headroom
        │
        ▼
Expected Peak Workload
```

Operating continuously near maximum capacity increases incident risk.

---

## Capacity Limits

Operational services SHOULD understand important resource limits.

Limits MAY originate from:

* infrastructure;
* operating systems;
* application configuration;
* databases;
* external providers;
* licensing;
* security controls.

Unknown limits represent operational risk.

---

## Resource Saturation

Saturation occurs when a resource approaches or reaches its effective capacity.

Examples include:

* CPU saturation;
* memory exhaustion;
* disk exhaustion;
* connection exhaustion;
* worker saturation;
* queue saturation.

Saturation SHOULD be observable.

---

## Saturation Indicators

FamilyOS SHOULD monitor relevant saturation indicators.

Examples include:

```text
CPU Utilization
Memory Pressure
Storage Utilization
Connection Pool Usage
Queue Depth
Worker Utilization
API Quota Usage
```

Indicators SHOULD provide enough warning to allow corrective action where practical.

---

## Resource Exhaustion

Resource exhaustion MUST fail predictably where possible.

Systems SHOULD avoid catastrophic behavior such as:

* uncontrolled crashes;
* data corruption;
* infinite queue growth;
* system-wide cascading failure.

Resource limits SHOULD be combined with appropriate failure handling.

---

## Storage Capacity

Storage capacity planning SHOULD consider:

* current data size;
* growth rate;
* backups;
* logs;
* temporary files;
* indexes;
* retained artifacts.

Storage monitoring SHOULD distinguish usable capacity from nominal capacity.

---

## Storage Growth

Storage growth SHOULD be measurable.

A simple forecasting model is:

```text
Current Storage
      +
Growth Rate
      +
Retention
      │
      ▼
Future Capacity Requirement
```

Unexpected growth SHOULD trigger investigation.

---

## Log Capacity

Observability data can itself consume significant resources.

Logging SHOULD therefore define:

* retention;
* rotation;
* maximum size;
* archival behavior;
* deletion behavior.

Unbounded logging MUST NOT be allowed to exhaust operational storage.

---

## Queue Capacity

Queues SHOULD have understood capacity behavior.

Queue management SHOULD define:

* maximum depth;
* consumer capacity;
* backlog thresholds;
* expiration;
* dead-letter behavior where applicable.

Unbounded queue growth SHOULD be avoided.

---

## Connection Capacity

Services using connection pools SHOULD define:

* minimum connections;
* maximum connections;
* acquisition timeout;
* idle behavior.

Connection limits SHOULD consider dependency capacity.

Increasing local connection limits MUST NOT overload downstream services.

---

## Capacity Forecasting

FamilyOS SHOULD forecast capacity where growth is meaningful.

Forecasting MAY use:

* historical usage;
* growth trends;
* expected adoption;
* planned features;
* workload simulations.

Forecasts SHOULD be reviewed when assumptions change.

---

## Capacity Review

Capacity SHOULD be reviewed:

* periodically;
* before major releases;
* before major migrations;
* after significant incidents;
* when workload changes materially.

Critical capacity assumptions SHOULD remain documented.

---

## Performance Engineering

Performance engineering ensures that FamilyOS responds within acceptable operational expectations.

Performance includes:

* latency;
* throughput;
* responsiveness;
* resource efficiency;
* scalability.

Performance MUST be evaluated in realistic conditions.

---

## Performance Objectives

Performance objectives SHOULD be explicit for important services.

Objectives MAY define:

* maximum acceptable latency;
* expected throughput;
* concurrency;
* resource consumption;
* queue delay.

Objectives SHOULD reflect user or service needs rather than arbitrary numbers.

---

## Latency

Latency represents the time required to complete an operation.

Latency MAY include:

```text
Request Processing
       +
Dependency Calls
       +
Queue Delay
       +
Storage Operations
       │
       ▼
End-to-End Latency
```

End-to-end latency SHOULD be preferred when measuring user-visible behavior.

---

## Latency Distribution

Average latency alone is insufficient.

Performance analysis SHOULD consider distributions such as:

* median;
* p90;
* p95;
* p99;
* maximum where meaningful.

High-percentile latency often reveals operational problems hidden by averages.

---

## Tail Latency

Tail latency represents unusually slow operations.

Tail latency MAY be caused by:

* dependency delays;
* resource contention;
* garbage collection;
* storage latency;
* queue buildup;
* retries.

Critical user-facing services SHOULD monitor meaningful tail latency.

---

## Throughput

Throughput represents the amount of useful work completed during a period.

Examples include:

```text
Requests / Second
Jobs / Minute
Events / Second
Documents / Hour
Plugin Executions / Minute
```

Throughput SHOULD be evaluated together with latency and error rate.

---

## Concurrency

Concurrency represents simultaneous active work.

High concurrency MAY create pressure on:

* memory;
* threads;
* connections;
* locks;
* external dependencies.

Concurrency limits SHOULD be explicit where necessary.

---

## Performance Under Load

Performance SHOULD be evaluated under increasing workload.

A typical behavior curve is:

```text
Low Load
   │
   ▼
Stable Performance
   │
   ▼
Increasing Load
   │
   ▼
Resource Pressure
   │
   ▼
Saturation
   │
   ▼
Degradation / Failure
```

FamilyOS SHOULD understand where significant degradation begins.

---

## Performance Baseline

Important services SHOULD establish a performance baseline.

A baseline MAY record:

* workload;
* latency;
* throughput;
* CPU usage;
* memory usage;
* storage activity.

Baselines allow regression detection.

---

## Performance Regression

A performance regression occurs when a change materially worsens operational behavior.

Regressions MAY include:

* increased latency;
* reduced throughput;
* increased memory usage;
* increased CPU usage;
* increased dependency load.

Significant regressions SHOULD be investigated before release.

---

## Performance Testing

Performance testing SHOULD be performed where risk justifies it.

Testing MAY include:

* load testing;
* stress testing;
* endurance testing;
* spike testing;
* scalability testing.

Tests SHOULD reflect realistic operational patterns.

---

## Load Testing

Load testing evaluates system behavior under expected workload.

Load tests SHOULD verify:

* acceptable latency;
* acceptable error rate;
* stable resource consumption;
* dependency behavior.

Load testing SHOULD identify whether normal workload is sustainable.

---

## Stress Testing

Stress testing intentionally exceeds expected workload to determine system limits.

Stress tests SHOULD identify:

* saturation point;
* failure mode;
* recovery behavior;
* bottlenecks.

Stress testing SHOULD occur in controlled environments.

---

## Spike Testing

Spike testing evaluates rapid workload increases.

Spike tests MAY validate:

* queue behavior;
* autoscaling;
* rate limiting;
* resource headroom;
* graceful degradation.

The system SHOULD avoid uncontrolled collapse during temporary spikes.

---

## Endurance Testing

Endurance testing evaluates behavior over extended periods.

It MAY identify:

* memory leaks;
* connection leaks;
* storage growth;
* queue accumulation;
* gradual performance degradation.

Long-running services SHOULD receive endurance testing where appropriate.

---

## Reliability

Reliability represents the ability of FamilyOS to provide correct service consistently over time.

Reliability depends on:

* software correctness;
* infrastructure stability;
* dependency reliability;
* capacity;
* failure handling;
* recovery;
* operational discipline.

Reliability MUST be treated as a system property.

---

## Reliability Model

A simplified reliability model is:

```text
Correct Software
      +
Sufficient Capacity
      +
Stable Dependencies
      +
Failure Containment
      +
Recovery Capability
      +
Operational Discipline
      │
      ▼
Reliable Service
```

No single component guarantees reliability.

---

## Availability

Availability describes whether a service is accessible and capable of providing required functionality.

Availability SHOULD be defined from the perspective of meaningful service capability.

A running process that cannot perform required work MUST NOT automatically count as available.

---

## Availability Calculation

A simple availability model MAY be:

```text
Availability =
Successful Service Time
───────────────────────
Expected Service Time
```

The exact measurement model SHOULD be documented.

---

## Planned Maintenance

Availability calculations MAY distinguish planned maintenance from unexpected downtime.

The treatment of planned maintenance MUST be explicit.

Maintenance SHOULD NOT be excluded merely to improve reported availability.

---

## Service Criticality

Availability and reliability expectations SHOULD depend on service criticality.

A possible classification is:

```text
Critical
Important
Standard
Auxiliary
```

Higher criticality MAY require stronger:

* redundancy;
* observability;
* recovery;
* testing;
* operational response.

---

## Service-Level Indicators

A Service-Level Indicator, or SLI, is a measurable representation of service behavior.

Possible SLIs include:

* availability;
* successful request ratio;
* latency;
* error rate;
* job completion rate;
* data freshness.

SLIs SHOULD represent meaningful user or service outcomes.

---

## SLI Quality

An SLI SHOULD be:

* measurable;
* understandable;
* stable;
* relevant;
* actionable.

Metrics that do not represent meaningful service behavior SHOULD NOT be promoted to primary SLIs.

---

## Service-Level Objectives

A Service-Level Objective, or SLO, defines a target for an SLI.

Example:

```text
SLI:
Successful request ratio

SLO:
≥ 99.9% during defined measurement window
```

SLOs SHOULD reflect operational requirements rather than arbitrary industry targets.

---

## SLO Scope

Every SLO SHOULD define:

* service;
* indicator;
* target;
* measurement window;
* exclusions where justified;
* data source.

Ambiguous SLOs provide limited operational value.

---

## Internal SLOs

FamilyOS MAY use internal SLOs even when no external service commitment exists.

Internal SLOs help:

* detect reliability degradation;
* guide engineering priorities;
* evaluate operational health;
* manage error budgets.

---

## Error Budgets

An error budget represents the amount of acceptable unreliability implied by an SLO.

Conceptually:

```text
Reliability Target
       │
       ▼
Allowed Failure
       │
       ▼
Error Budget
```

Error budgets MAY guide decisions between reliability work and feature delivery.

---

## Error Budget Consumption

Rapid error-budget consumption SHOULD trigger investigation.

Potential responses MAY include:

* slowing risky changes;
* reliability work;
* capacity expansion;
* incident analysis;
* stronger validation.

Error budgets SHOULD NOT justify preventable failures.

---

## Reliability Indicators

FamilyOS MAY monitor reliability indicators such as:

* failure rate;
* restart frequency;
* incident frequency;
* successful job ratio;
* mean recovery time;
* dependency availability.

Indicators SHOULD support operational decisions.

---

## Mean Time to Detect

Mean Time to Detect, or MTTD, measures how quickly operational failures are discovered.

Lower detection time generally reduces impact.

FamilyOS SHOULD improve detection through observability and meaningful alerting.

---

## Mean Time to Recovery

Mean Time to Recovery, or MTTR, measures how quickly trusted service is restored after failure.

Recovery time MAY include:

```text
Detection
   +
Diagnosis
   +
Mitigation
   +
Restoration
   +
Validation
```

MTTR SHOULD be interpreted in operational context.

---

## Failure Rate

Failure rate SHOULD measure meaningful service failures rather than only process crashes.

Failures MAY include:

* failed requests;
* failed jobs;
* unavailable capabilities;
* integrity failures;
* dependency failures.

---

## Reliability Targets

Reliability targets SHOULD be proportional to:

* service importance;
* user impact;
* recovery difficulty;
* data sensitivity;
* operational cost.

Not every component requires the same reliability level.

---

## Resilience

Resilience is the ability to continue or restore useful operation despite failures.

Resilience mechanisms MAY include:

* redundancy;
* retries;
* timeouts;
* circuit breakers;
* queues;
* graceful degradation;
* recovery procedures.

Resilience MUST NOT create uncontrolled complexity.

---

## Failure Containment

Failures SHOULD be contained to the smallest practical scope.

Containment MAY occur at:

```text
Operation
   │
   ▼
Process
   │
   ▼
Service
   │
   ▼
Plugin
   │
   ▼
Environment
```

Failure propagation SHOULD be minimized.

---

## Cascading Failure

A cascading failure occurs when one failure causes additional components to fail.

Common causes include:

* unlimited retries;
* dependency overload;
* connection exhaustion;
* queue explosion;
* synchronized restart;
* missing timeouts.

FamilyOS SHOULD design explicitly against cascading failure.

---

## Retry Storms

Retries MUST be bounded.

When a dependency fails, uncontrolled retry may amplify the outage.

Retry policies SHOULD use:

* maximum attempts;
* backoff;
* jitter;
* circuit breaking where appropriate.

---

## Load Shedding

Services MAY reject lower-priority work when capacity is exhausted.

Load shedding can protect core functionality.

```text
Capacity Pressure
       │
       ▼
Reject / Delay Lower Priority Work
       │
       ▼
Preserve Critical Capability
```

Load shedding MUST remain predictable.

---

## Graceful Degradation

Where safe, services SHOULD degrade rather than fail completely.

Possible degradation strategies include:

* read-only operation;
* cached information;
* delayed background work;
* disabled optional integrations.

Degradation MUST NOT weaken security or data-integrity guarantees.

---

## Redundancy

Critical services MAY use redundancy to improve availability.

Redundancy MAY include:

* multiple service instances;
* replicated storage;
* redundant infrastructure;
* alternative dependencies.

Redundancy MUST itself be tested.

Untested redundancy provides limited assurance.

---

## Single Points of Failure

Critical operational paths SHOULD identify single points of failure.

A single point of failure MAY exist in:

* infrastructure;
* storage;
* credentials;
* network;
* deployment pipeline;
* external dependency.

Not every single point of failure must be eliminated, but significant ones SHOULD be understood.

---

## Scalability

Scalability describes the ability to support increasing workload through additional resources or architectural adaptation.

Scaling MAY be:

```text
Vertical Scaling
      or
Horizontal Scaling
```

The appropriate strategy depends on workload and architecture.

---

## Vertical Scaling

Vertical scaling increases resources available to an existing instance.

Examples include:

* more CPU;
* more memory;
* faster storage.

Vertical scaling is often operationally simple but has practical limits.

---

## Horizontal Scaling

Horizontal scaling increases the number of service instances.

Horizontal scaling SHOULD consider:

* state management;
* load balancing;
* concurrency;
* shared dependencies;
* distributed coordination.

Stateless services are generally easier to scale horizontally.

---

## Autoscaling

FamilyOS MAY support automatic scaling where justified.

Autoscaling MUST use meaningful signals.

Signals MAY include:

* CPU;
* queue depth;
* request rate;
* concurrency.

Autoscaling SHOULD define minimum and maximum boundaries.

---

## Scaling Lag

Scaling is not instantaneous.

Capacity planning SHOULD account for:

* provisioning delay;
* service startup;
* dependency initialization;
* cache warm-up.

Sufficient headroom MAY be required to absorb demand during scaling.

---

## Dependency Capacity

A service cannot scale safely beyond the capacity of its dependencies.

```text
Application Capacity
        │
        ▼
Database Capacity
        │
        ▼
External Service Capacity
```

Scaling one layer MAY simply move the bottleneck elsewhere.

---

## Bottleneck Analysis

Performance problems SHOULD be investigated using evidence.

Potential bottlenecks include:

* CPU;
* memory;
* disk;
* network;
* locks;
* database queries;
* external APIs;
* queue consumers.

Optimization SHOULD target measured bottlenecks.

---

## Performance Optimization

Optimization MUST preserve:

* correctness;
* security;
* maintainability;
* observability.

Premature optimization SHOULD be avoided when no meaningful performance requirement exists.

---

## Caching

Caching MAY improve performance and reduce dependency load.

Cache design SHOULD define:

* source of truth;
* invalidation;
* expiration;
* capacity;
* failure behavior.

Cached data MUST respect security and privacy requirements.

---

## Rate Limiting

Rate limiting MAY protect services and dependencies from excessive demand.

Limits MAY apply by:

* principal;
* service;
* plugin;
* endpoint;
* integration.

Rate limiting SHOULD produce observable and understandable failure behavior.

---

## Backpressure

Backpressure SHOULD be used when downstream processing cannot keep pace with incoming workload.

Backpressure MAY:

* delay producers;
* reject new work;
* limit queue growth;
* reduce concurrency.

Backpressure protects system stability.

---

## Priority Management

Workloads MAY have different operational priorities.

For example:

```text
Critical Operations
        │
        ▼
User Operations
        │
        ▼
Background Processing
        │
        ▼
Optional Maintenance
```

During capacity pressure, lower-priority work MAY be delayed before critical functionality.

---

## Performance Observability

Performance MUST be observable.

Relevant signals SHOULD include:

* latency;
* throughput;
* errors;
* saturation;
* resource usage;
* queue depth;
* dependency latency.

These signals SHOULD integrate with EPIC-OBS-001 — Observability Framework.

---

## Golden Signals

FamilyOS SHOULD consider the common operational signals:

```text
Latency
Traffic
Errors
Saturation
```

These signals provide a useful baseline for service reliability monitoring.

Additional domain-specific signals MAY be required.

---

## Performance Alerting

Alerts SHOULD identify actionable performance conditions.

Examples include:

* sustained high latency;
* excessive error rate;
* queue saturation;
* storage exhaustion risk;
* abnormal resource consumption.

Short harmless spikes SHOULD NOT necessarily generate urgent alerts.

---

## Capacity Alerting

Capacity alerts SHOULD provide sufficient time for corrective action.

Thresholds MAY include:

```text
Warning
Critical
Exhausted
```

Thresholds SHOULD reflect actual operational behavior rather than arbitrary percentages.

---

## Reliability Alerting

Reliability alerts SHOULD focus on service impact.

Examples include:

* SLO violation;
* excessive failure rate;
* critical dependency outage;
* repeated restart;
* sustained degraded state.

Alerts MUST integrate with operational incident-management processes.

---

## Performance and Logging

Performance diagnostics MAY require detailed logs.

However, excessive logging can itself reduce performance.

Logging levels SHOULD balance:

* diagnostic value;
* storage cost;
* CPU cost;
* privacy;
* operational usefulness.

---

## Performance and Tracing

Tracing MAY identify latency across distributed operations.

Tracing SHOULD help answer:

```text
Where was time spent?
Which dependency was slow?
Which operation failed?
```

Sampling MAY be necessary to control overhead.

---

## Performance and Security

Performance optimization MUST NOT bypass security controls.

Security operations MAY add legitimate cost through:

* authentication;
* authorization;
* encryption;
* auditing.

Optimization SHOULD improve implementation efficiency rather than remove required controls.

---

## Reliability and Security

Security failures MAY become reliability failures.

Examples include:

* expired credentials;
* certificate expiration;
* denied service access;
* compromised dependencies.

Operational reliability planning MUST therefore integrate with EPIC-SEC-001 — Security Framework.

---

## Reliability and Data Integrity

Availability MUST NOT be preserved by sacrificing data integrity.

When forced to choose between unsafe processing and temporary unavailability, FamilyOS SHOULD preserve correctness and integrity.

---

## Reliability and Recovery

Reliability includes the ability to recover.

Recovery objectives SHOULD consider:

* service criticality;
* data importance;
* dependency restoration;
* configuration;
* credentials.

Recovery MUST restore trusted service, not merely running processes.

---

## Reliability Testing

Reliability mechanisms SHOULD be tested.

Tests MAY include:

* dependency outage;
* process crash;
* resource exhaustion;
* restart;
* network delay;
* queue saturation;
* degraded operation.

Testing SHOULD verify both failure behavior and recovery.

---

## Failure Injection

Controlled failure injection MAY be used to validate resilience.

Failure injection MUST:

* occur in appropriate environments;
* have defined scope;
* protect production safety;
* produce observable results.

Production experimentation requires explicit governance.

---

## Chaos Engineering

FamilyOS MAY adopt controlled chaos-engineering practices when operational maturity justifies them.

Chaos experiments SHOULD test explicit hypotheses.

Example:

```text
Hypothesis:
Service remains available when one worker instance fails.

Experiment:
Terminate one worker instance.

Expected:
Remaining instances continue processing within SLO.
```

Chaos engineering MUST NOT become uncontrolled disruption.

---

## Performance Test Environments

Performance tests SHOULD execute in environments representative enough to produce meaningful results.

Differences from production SHOULD be understood.

Performance results from unrealistic environments MUST NOT be treated as definitive production guarantees.

---

## Performance Test Data

Test data SHOULD represent realistic:

* volume;
* distribution;
* relationships;
* access patterns.

Sensitive production data SHOULD NOT be copied into test environments without appropriate controls.

---

## Performance Regression Gates

Important services MAY define automated performance gates.

A gate MAY reject a change when:

```text
Latency Regression > Allowed Threshold
or
Throughput Regression > Allowed Threshold
or
Resource Increase > Allowed Threshold
```

Thresholds SHOULD account for measurement variability.

---

## Reliability Gates

Release readiness MAY include reliability requirements such as:

* required resilience tests passing;
* no known critical capacity issue;
* recovery validated;
* operational SLO instrumentation present.

Reliability gates SHOULD integrate with EPIC-QLT-001 — Quality Framework.

---

## Capacity and Release Planning

Major releases SHOULD consider capacity impact.

Changes MAY alter:

* memory requirements;
* CPU requirements;
* storage growth;
* network traffic;
* dependency usage.

Significant capacity changes SHOULD be identified before production deployment.

---

## Capacity and Deployment

Deployments SHOULD be monitored for changes in:

* latency;
* error rate;
* resource usage;
* queue behavior;
* dependency pressure.

Unexpected deterioration SHOULD trigger investigation or rollback consideration.

---

## Reliability and Change Management

Operational change is a major source of reliability risk.

FamilyOS SHOULD reduce this risk through:

* small changes;
* validation;
* controlled deployment;
* observability;
* rollback readiness.

High-risk changes SHOULD receive stronger operational supervision.

---

## Reliability and Incident Management

Capacity or performance failures that materially affect service SHOULD enter the incident-management process.

Incidents SHOULD capture:

* affected service;
* resource state;
* workload;
* symptoms;
* mitigation;
* recovery.

Repeated incidents SHOULD trigger deeper problem analysis.

---

## Reliability and Problem Management

Recurring performance or capacity incidents SHOULD NOT be repeatedly mitigated without addressing underlying causes.

Problem management SHOULD investigate:

* architectural bottlenecks;
* insufficient capacity;
* configuration errors;
* inefficient code;
* dependency constraints.

Permanent improvement SHOULD be preferred over recurring manual intervention.

---

## Operational Efficiency

FamilyOS SHOULD seek efficient use of resources without compromising required reliability.

Efficiency MAY include:

* reducing idle resources;
* optimizing storage;
* controlling unnecessary work;
* reducing excessive telemetry;
* improving algorithms.

Efficiency SHOULD be measured rather than assumed.

---

## Cost Awareness

Operational resources have cost.

Capacity decisions SHOULD consider:

```text
Reliability
    +
Performance
    +
Capacity
    +
Operational Complexity
    +
Cost
```

Lowest cost MUST NOT automatically override reliability or security requirements.

---

## Capacity Documentation

Important capacity assumptions SHOULD be documented.

Documentation MAY include:

* workload model;
* resource limits;
* expected peaks;
* scaling behavior;
* known bottlenecks.

Documentation MUST follow EPIC-DOC-001 — Documentation Framework.

---

## Performance Documentation

Important services SHOULD document relevant performance expectations.

Documentation MAY include:

* latency targets;
* throughput targets;
* test methodology;
* known constraints.

Performance claims SHOULD be supported by evidence.

---

## Reliability Documentation

Reliability documentation SHOULD identify:

* service criticality;
* SLIs;
* SLOs;
* dependencies;
* degradation behavior;
* recovery expectations.

Critical services SHOULD have clear operational reliability expectations.

---

## Capacity Evidence

Capacity evidence MAY include:

* utilization history;
* load-test results;
* growth forecasts;
* saturation measurements;
* scaling tests.

Evidence SHOULD support capacity decisions.

---

## Performance Evidence

Performance evidence MAY include:

* benchmark results;
* latency distributions;
* throughput results;
* profiling data;
* regression comparisons.

Evidence SHOULD record enough context to reproduce or interpret results.

---

## Reliability Evidence

Reliability evidence MAY include:

* SLI history;
* SLO compliance;
* incident history;
* recovery tests;
* resilience tests;
* availability reports.

Reliability decisions SHOULD be evidence-based.

---

## Operational Metrics

FamilyOS MAY maintain metrics such as:

Metrics SHOULD be selected based on operational usefulness.

---

## Metric Cardinality

Operational metrics SHOULD control label cardinality.

Unbounded dimensions MAY cause:

* excessive storage;
* high monitoring cost;
* poor query performance.

Identifiers such as individual request IDs SHOULD generally belong in traces or logs rather than metric labels.

---

## Measurement Integrity

Performance and reliability measurements MUST be trustworthy.

Measurement systems SHOULD define:

* data source;
* sampling;
* aggregation;
* retention;
* clock assumptions.

Misleading metrics can produce incorrect operational decisions.

---

## Performance Review

Performance SHOULD be reviewed when:

* major architecture changes occur;
* workload changes materially;
* regressions appear;
* capacity approaches limits;
* incidents reveal bottlenecks.

Reviews SHOULD produce actionable outcomes.

---

## Reliability Review

Reliability SHOULD be reviewed periodically for critical services.

Review MAY evaluate:

* SLO performance;
* incidents;
* error-budget consumption;
* recovery;
* dependencies;
* capacity risks.

Persistent reliability problems SHOULD influence engineering priorities.

---

## Capacity Review Flow

The canonical capacity-review process is:

```text
Observe Workload
      │
      ▼
Measure Resources
      │
      ▼
Identify Trends
      │
      ▼
Forecast Demand
      │
      ▼
Compare Capacity
      │
  ┌───┴────┐
  ▼        ▼
Enough   Risk
  │        │
  │        ▼
  │     Expand /
  │     Optimize
  │        │
  └────┬───┘
       ▼
   Revalidate
```

Capacity management is therefore continuous.

---

## Performance Optimization Flow

Performance optimization SHOULD follow:

```text
Measure
  │
  ▼
Identify Bottleneck
  │
  ▼
Form Hypothesis
  │
  ▼
Implement Change
  │
  ▼
Benchmark
  │
  ▼
Compare
  │
  ├── Improved → Accept
  │
  └── Not Improved → Reassess
```

Optimization without measurement SHOULD be avoided.

---

## Reliability Improvement Flow

Reliability improvement follows:

```text
Observe
  │
  ▼
Detect Failure Pattern
  │
  ▼
Analyze Cause
  │
  ▼
Improve Architecture /
Controls / Capacity
  │
  ▼
Test
  │
  ▼
Deploy
  │
  ▼
Measure
```

Operational evidence feeds engineering improvement.

---

## Integration With Runtime Management

This document extends the runtime requirements established by `04-Runtime-and-Service-Management.md`.

Runtime management provides:

* service lifecycle;
* health;
* resource controls;
* dependency management;
* runtime state.

Capacity, performance, and reliability determine whether those runtime services can sustain required workloads over time.

---

## Integration With Observability

EPIC-OBS-001 — Observability Framework provides the telemetry required for capacity and reliability engineering.

FamilyOS SHOULD use standardized:

* metrics;
* logs;
* traces;
* events;
* health signals.

Parallel incompatible reliability telemetry SHOULD be avoided.

---

## Integration With Testing

EPIC-TST-001 — Testing Framework provides standardized test mechanisms.

Performance and reliability testing SHOULD integrate with:

* test environments;
* fixtures;
* automation;
* reporting;
* evidence.

Performance tests SHOULD remain reproducible where practical.

---

## Integration With Quality

EPIC-QLT-001 — Quality Framework establishes overall quality governance.

Capacity, performance, and reliability SHOULD participate in quality assessment.

A functionally correct release MAY still fail quality gates if it introduces unacceptable operational instability.

---

## Integration With Build

EPIC-BLD-001 — Build Framework ensures controlled artifact production.

Performance validation SHOULD identify the exact build under test.

Benchmark results SHOULD be traceable to build identity where significant.

---

## Integration With Release

EPIC-REL-001 — Release Framework governs release readiness.

Important capacity or reliability regressions SHOULD affect release decisions.

Release evidence MAY include:

* performance results;
* reliability validation;
* capacity assessment.

---

## Integration With Security

EPIC-SEC-001 — Security Framework remains authoritative for security requirements.

Performance or reliability optimization MUST NOT weaken:

* authentication;
* authorization;
* cryptography;
* data protection;
* auditing;
* isolation.

Security and reliability SHOULD reinforce each other.

---

## Capacity Invariants

The following capacity invariants apply across FamilyOS:

1. critical resource limits SHOULD be understood;
2. unbounded resource consumption SHOULD be avoided;
3. significant resource saturation SHOULD be observable;
4. capacity planning SHOULD consider peak workload;
5. storage growth SHOULD be measurable;
6. queues SHOULD NOT grow without operational bounds;
7. dependency capacity MUST be considered when scaling;
8. important capacity assumptions SHOULD remain documented.

---

## Performance Invariants

The following performance invariants apply:

1. performance SHOULD be measured under meaningful workload;
2. averages SHOULD NOT be the only latency measurement for critical services;
3. significant performance regressions SHOULD be detected;
4. optimization MUST preserve correctness and security;
5. performance evidence SHOULD identify the tested release or build;
6. resource efficiency SHOULD be measured rather than assumed.

---

## Reliability Invariants

The following reliability invariants apply:

1. reliability MUST be measured through meaningful service behavior;
2. availability MUST NOT be inferred only from process existence;
3. critical services SHOULD define reliability expectations;
4. retries MUST remain bounded;
5. cascading failures SHOULD be actively prevented;
6. degraded operation MUST preserve security and integrity;
7. recovery MUST restore trusted service;
8. important reliability mechanisms SHOULD be tested;
9. repeated incidents SHOULD drive permanent improvement;
10. operational changes SHOULD preserve or improve required reliability.

---

## Canonical Capacity, Performance and Reliability Model

The FamilyOS model is:

```text
                       Workload

              │                       ▼
              │             Scale / Optimize /
              │             Degrade / Recover
              │                       │
              └───────────────┬───────┘
                              ▼
                        Revalidation
                              │
                              ▼
                     Continuous Improvement
```

This model ensures that capacity, performance, and reliability remain connected throughout FamilyOS operations.

---

## Operational Readiness Criteria

A service SHOULD NOT be considered fully operationally ready when significant capacity or reliability requirements exist unless:

```text
Workload Understood
       +
Capacity Evaluated
       +
Resource Limits Defined
       +
Performance Baseline Established
       +
Health Observable
       +
Failure Behavior Defined
       +
Recovery Validated
       +
Reliability Indicators Available
       │
       ▼
OPERATIONALLY READY
```

The strength of each requirement SHOULD reflect service criticality.

---

## Expected Outcomes

The FamilyOS Capacity, Performance and Reliability model enables:

* predictable resource usage;
* proactive capacity management;
* measurable performance;
* early saturation detection;
* performance-regression detection;
* realistic load validation;
* controlled scalability;
* meaningful availability measurement;
* service-level objectives;
* reliability engineering;
* graceful degradation;
* cascading-failure prevention;
* faster recovery;
* evidence-based optimization;
* improved operational planning;
* continuous reliability improvement.

---

## Final Principle

FamilyOS capacity, performance, and reliability engineering is based on the following principle:

> A reliable service is not one that merely works under ideal conditions; it is one whose workload is understood, whose resource limits are controlled, whose performance is measurable, whose failure behavior is deliberate, and whose required service can be preserved or restored when operational conditions deteriorate.

Capacity provides the resources required for operation.

Performance determines how effectively those resources deliver useful work.

Reliability determines whether that useful work remains available and correct over time.

Together, they establish the operational resilience required for sustainable FamilyOS operation.
