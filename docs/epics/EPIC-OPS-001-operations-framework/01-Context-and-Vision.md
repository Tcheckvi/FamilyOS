# Operations Framework

## EPIC-OPS-001

### Context and Vision

### Overview

EPIC-OPS-001 — Operations Framework establishes the operational foundation for the FamilyOS ecosystem.

FamilyOS already defines engineering foundations for architecture, development, testing, quality, documentation, build, release, observability, security, and plugin governance.

The Operations Framework connects those foundations to the runtime lifecycle.

Its purpose is to define how FamilyOS should be operated, monitored, maintained, recovered, and continuously improved once software moves beyond development and release into active execution.

Operations is treated as an engineering capability rather than a collection of manual procedures.

The framework establishes a consistent model for:

* runtime management;
* service operation;
* operational health;
* reliability;
* incident response;
* recovery;
* capacity management;
* performance management;
* operational security;
* operational governance;
* automation;
* validation.

The framework remains intentionally compact.

Its objective is not to create an enterprise operations organization before FamilyOS requires one.

Its objective is to establish the architectural rules required for safe, reliable, and sustainable operation.

---

## Context

FamilyOS is evolving from a software project into a platform composed of interacting capabilities, plugins, services, repositories, integrations, configuration, security controls, and automation.

As this architecture grows, successful implementation alone is insufficient.

A system may be:

```text
Correctly Designed
        +
Correctly Implemented
        +
Correctly Tested
        +
Correctly Built
        +
Correctly Released
```

and still fail operationally.

Operational failures may result from:

* invalid runtime configuration;
* unavailable dependencies;
* resource exhaustion;
* degraded performance;
* failed integrations;
* expired credentials;
* unexpected workload;
* incomplete recovery procedures;
* insufficient operational visibility;
* security incidents;
* deployment failures;
* human operational errors.

EPIC-OPS-001 defines how FamilyOS prepares for and responds to these realities.

---

## Engineering to Operations

FamilyOS engineering frameworks establish a lifecycle that reaches the release boundary.

The Operations Framework extends that lifecycle:

```text
Architecture
    ↓
Implementation
    ↓
Testing
    ↓
Quality
    ↓
Build
    ↓
Release
    ↓
Operations
    ↓
Runtime Evidence
    ↓
Improvement
```

Operations therefore completes the engineering feedback loop.

---

## Operational Vision

The FamilyOS operational vision is:

> FamilyOS should be operable, diagnosable, recoverable, secure, and maintainable through explicit runtime contracts and automation proportional to its actual operational complexity.

The goal is not zero failure.

The goal is controlled failure and predictable recovery.

---

## Operational Mission

The Operations Framework exists to ensure that FamilyOS can answer:

```text
What is running?

What should be running?

Is it healthy?

Is it performing acceptably?

Which dependencies does it require?

What changed?

What failed?

What is affected?

How do we diagnose it?

How do we recover?

How do we verify recovery?

What evidence should be retained?

How do we prevent recurrence?
```

A system that cannot answer these questions is difficult to operate reliably.

---

## Operations as an Engineering Capability

Operations is not defined as a separate downstream team responsibility.

Instead:

```text
Design
   ↓
Operability Requirements
   ↓
Implementation
   ↓
Operational Automation
   ↓
Runtime
   ↓
Operational Evidence
```

Developers designing FamilyOS capabilities should consider how those capabilities behave during normal and abnormal operation.

---

## Operability

Operability describes how effectively a system can be operated.

A FamilyOS component is operable when its operational behavior is sufficiently:

* understandable;
* observable;
* configurable;
* controllable;
* diagnosable;
* recoverable;
* testable;
* automatable.

Operability should be considered an architectural quality.

---

## Operational Simplicity

FamilyOS SHOULD prefer simple operational models.

Operational complexity creates:

* additional failure modes;
* larger configuration surfaces;
* increased security exposure;
* more difficult recovery;
* higher maintenance burden.

The preferred progression is:

```text
Simple Runtime
      ↓
Measured Need
      ↓
Incremental Capability
      ↓
Additional Automation
```

rather than introducing infrastructure for hypothetical future scale.

---

## Scope

EPIC-OPS-001 covers the operational architecture of FamilyOS.

The scope includes:

* runtime lifecycle;
* service management;
* process management;
* operational configuration;
* dependency management;
* health evaluation;
* readiness;
* degradation;
* reliability;
* performance;
* capacity;
* incidents;
* recovery;
* operational security;
* operational evidence;
* automation;
* operational validation.

---

## Out of Scope

EPIC-OPS-001 does not require immediate implementation of:

* enterprise orchestration platforms;
* Kubernetes;
* enterprise service management suites;
* a Network Operations Center;
* a Security Operations Center;
* global multi-region infrastructure;
* automatic horizontal scaling;
* enterprise disaster-recovery infrastructure;
* large-scale distributed tracing infrastructure;
* 24/7 operational staffing;
* complex SRE organizational structures.

Such capabilities may be introduced later if FamilyOS operational requirements justify them.

---

## Relationship With Existing Frameworks

The Operations Framework consumes existing FamilyOS engineering foundations.

It does not replace them.

The relationship is:

```text
Engineering Foundation
        ↓
Testing Framework
        ↓
Quality Framework
        ↓
Build Framework
        ↓
Release Framework
        ↓
Observability Framework
        ↓
Security Framework
        ↓
Operations Framework
```

Operations is therefore an integration point for several existing platform capabilities.

---

## Relationship With Engineering Foundation

The Engineering Foundation defines how FamilyOS software is designed and developed.

Operations consumes those engineering decisions once software executes.

Engineering decisions affecting runtime behavior SHOULD consider operational consequences.

Examples include:

* process architecture;
* configuration;
* dependency boundaries;
* failure behavior;
* resource usage;
* integration behavior.

---

## Relationship With Testing

The Testing Framework validates expected software behavior before release.

Operations extends validation into runtime conditions.

Operational testing may include:

* startup validation;
* shutdown behavior;
* dependency failure;
* degraded operation;
* recovery;
* configuration failure;
* resource constraints.

Operational validation does not replace functional testing.

---

## Relationship With Quality

The Quality Framework establishes quality expectations and evidence.

Operability and reliability are important quality characteristics.

Operational evidence may therefore contribute to quality assessment.

Examples include:

```text
Health Evidence
Reliability Evidence
Performance Evidence
Incident Evidence
Recovery Evidence
```

---

## Relationship With Build

The Build Framework produces controlled artifacts.

Operations consumes those artifacts.

Operational environments SHOULD know which artifact is running.

Conceptually:

```text
Source
  ↓
Build
  ↓
Artifact
  ↓
Release
  ↓
Runtime
```

Runtime identity should remain traceable to the released artifact.

---

## Relationship With Release

The Release Framework defines controlled publication and release decisions.

Operations begins when a released artifact is placed into an execution environment.

The boundary is:

```text
Release Candidate
       ↓
Release Validation
       ↓
Approved Artifact
       ↓
Operational Deployment
       ↓
Runtime
```

Release and operations must remain connected through artifact identity and evidence.

---

## Relationship With Observability

The Observability Framework is a fundamental dependency of operations.

Observability answers:

```text
What is happening?
```

Operations uses that information to answer:

```text
What should we do about it?
```

The relationship is:

```text
Runtime
   ↓
Observability
   ↓
Operational Understanding
   ↓
Operational Decision
   ↓
Operational Action
```

Operations MUST NOT create a competing telemetry architecture.

---

## Relationship With Security

The Security Framework establishes trust, authorization, data protection, security controls, and security evidence.

Operations applies those requirements during runtime management.

Operational actions may themselves be privileged.

Examples include:

* starting services;
* stopping services;
* changing configuration;
* accessing diagnostics;
* executing recovery;
* rotating credentials;
* changing operational state.

Such actions should remain subject to applicable security controls.

---

## Relationship With Plugin Architecture

FamilyOS plugins may introduce operational behavior.

Plugins may:

* consume resources;
* depend on external systems;
* expose capabilities;
* fail independently;
* require configuration;
* emit telemetry.

The Operations Framework defines common expectations for operationally relevant plugin behavior.

---

## Runtime Model

The FamilyOS runtime should be understood as a collection of operational units.

Conceptually:

```text
FamilyOS Runtime
      │
      ├── Core
      ├── Capabilities
      ├── Plugins
      ├── Repositories
      ├── Adapters
      └── Integrations
```

Not every unit must become an independent operating-system process or service.

Operational architecture should reflect actual deployment architecture.

---

## Operational Unit

An operational unit is a component for which meaningful operational state can be evaluated.

Examples may include:

* a FamilyOS process;
* a plugin;
* a repository adapter;
* an external integration;
* a scheduled operation;
* a background worker.

Operational units should only be introduced where they provide useful management boundaries.

---

## Runtime State

Operational units may expose state such as:

```text
STARTING
READY
DEGRADED
UNAVAILABLE
STOPPING
STOPPED
```

The exact model should remain appropriate to the implementation.

Not every component requires every state.

---

## Desired State and Actual State

Operations distinguishes between:

```text
Desired State
```

and:

```text
Actual State
```

For example:

```text
Desired: READY
Actual:  DEGRADED
```

This difference creates an operational condition requiring evaluation.

---

## Operational Control Loop

The conceptual operational loop is:

```text
Desired State
      ↓
Runtime
      ↓
Observation
      ↓
Evaluation
      ↓
Action
      ↓
Verification
      └──────────► Runtime
```

Automation may eventually execute portions of this loop.

Human control remains appropriate where risk or complexity requires it.

---

## Runtime Lifecycle

Operational units may follow:

```text
Configure
   ↓
Validate
   ↓
Start
   ↓
Initialize
   ↓
Ready
   ↓
Operate
   ↓
Degrade / Recover
   ↓
Stop
```

Lifecycle transitions should be predictable.

---

## Startup

Startup SHOULD validate critical runtime requirements before declaring readiness.

Potential checks include:

* configuration validity;
* required dependencies;
* required credentials;
* repository availability;
* plugin compatibility;
* security configuration.

Startup must not claim readiness prematurely.

---

## Readiness

Readiness answers:

> Can this component safely perform its intended operational responsibilities now?

Readiness differs from process existence.

A process may be running but not ready.

---

## Liveness

Liveness answers:

> Is the operational unit still capable of progressing?

Liveness and readiness should remain conceptually distinct.

---

## Health

Health represents the operational condition of a component.

A conceptual model may include:

```text
HEALTHY
DEGRADED
UNHEALTHY
UNKNOWN
```

Health semantics should remain explicit.

---

## Degraded Operation

FamilyOS SHOULD support controlled degradation where appropriate.

For example:

```text
External Integration Failure
          ↓
Integration Capability Unavailable
          ↓
Core FamilyOS Remains Operational
```

Failure isolation is preferable to unnecessary platform-wide failure.

---

## Dependency Model

Runtime components may depend on:

* repositories;
* plugins;
* local resources;
* configuration;
* credentials;
* external APIs;
* operating-system facilities.

Dependencies should be explicit where operationally relevant.

---

## Critical Dependencies

A critical dependency is required for an operational unit to perform its essential responsibility.

Failure may cause:

```text
READY
  ↓
UNAVAILABLE
```

or prevent startup.

---

## Optional Dependencies

An optional dependency may allow degraded operation.

For example:

```text
Optional Integration Failure
          ↓
DEGRADED
```

rather than complete platform failure.

---

## Dependency Failure Isolation

Failures should be contained where architecture allows.

The preferred principle is:

```text
Local Failure
     ↓
Local Impact
```

rather than:

```text
Local Failure
     ↓
Global Failure
```

unless the failed component is genuinely critical.

---

## Runtime Configuration

Operational configuration determines runtime behavior.

Configuration SHOULD be:

* explicit;
* validated;
* version-aware where necessary;
* environment-appropriate;
* security-conscious.

Invalid critical configuration should fail predictably.

---

## Configuration Drift

Configuration drift occurs when actual operational configuration differs unexpectedly from intended configuration.

FamilyOS SHOULD minimize undocumented runtime changes.

As operational maturity grows, configuration should become increasingly reproducible.

---

## Environment Model

FamilyOS may eventually operate across environments such as:

```text
Development
Testing
Staging
Production
```

The framework does not require all environments immediately.

Environment-specific differences should be intentional.

---

## Environment Parity

Perfect parity is not always practical.

However, critical behavior should not differ unexpectedly between validation and production environments.

Important differences should be documented or represented explicitly in configuration.

---

## Reliability

Reliability describes the ability of FamilyOS to perform expected functions over time.

Reliability depends on:

```text
Correctness
     +
Availability
     +
Failure Isolation
     +
Recovery
     +
Operational Visibility
```

Reliability cannot be created by monitoring alone.

---

## Reliability Engineering

FamilyOS SHOULD improve reliability by:

* reducing unnecessary complexity;
* identifying critical dependencies;
* testing failure behavior;
* automating repetitive operations;
* defining recovery procedures;
* learning from incidents.

---

## Reliability Targets

Formal service-level objectives are not required immediately.

When useful, FamilyOS may define measurable targets for:

* availability;
* latency;
* error rates;
* recovery time;
* successful execution rates.

Targets should be based on actual user and platform needs.

---

## Performance

Operational performance concerns include:

* latency;
* throughput;
* startup time;
* execution time;
* resource utilization.

Performance should be measured before significant optimization.

---

## Performance Baselines

FamilyOS MAY establish baselines for important operations.

A baseline enables detection of:

```text
Expected Performance
        ↓
Measured Performance
        ↓
Regression Detection
```

Baselines should remain reproducible where possible.

---

## Capacity

Capacity describes the resources available to support expected workloads.

Relevant resources may include:

* CPU;
* memory;
* storage;
* network;
* external API quotas;
* worker capacity;
* database connections.

Capacity management should remain proportional to actual deployment scale.

---

## Resource Exhaustion

FamilyOS should fail predictably when resources become constrained.

Potential strategies include:

* bounded queues;
* timeouts;
* controlled retries;
* rejection;
* graceful degradation.

Unlimited resource consumption should be avoided.

---

## Incident

An incident is an operational condition that causes or threatens meaningful degradation of FamilyOS.

Examples may include:

* service unavailable;
* persistent capability failure;
* security compromise;
* corrupted operational data;
* failed release;
* unavailable critical dependency;
* severe performance degradation.

Not every warning is an incident.

---

## Incident Lifecycle

A conceptual incident lifecycle is:

```text
Detection
   ↓
Assessment
   ↓
Containment
   ↓
Mitigation
   ↓
Recovery
   ↓
Verification
   ↓
Review
```

The process should remain proportional to incident severity.

---

## Incident Severity

FamilyOS may use a lightweight severity model:

```text
LOW
MEDIUM
HIGH
CRITICAL
```

Severity should reflect operational impact and urgency.

---

## Incident Evidence

Useful incident evidence may include:

* timestamps;
* affected components;
* runtime version;
* relevant configuration identifiers;
* health state;
* logs;
* metrics;
* traces;
* security events;
* actions performed;
* recovery result.

Evidence must respect security and privacy requirements.

---

## Recovery

Recovery restores an operational unit to an acceptable state after failure.

Recovery may include:

* restart;
* configuration correction;
* dependency restoration;
* rollback;
* data restoration;
* credential replacement;
* plugin isolation.

Recovery procedures should be explicit for significant failure modes.

---

## Recovery Verification

Recovery is not complete merely because an action executed successfully.

The required pattern is:

```text
Recovery Action
      ↓
Runtime Observation
      ↓
Health Validation
      ↓
Functional Validation
      ↓
Recovery Confirmed
```

---

## Rollback

Rollback is one possible recovery mechanism.

The Release Framework defines release-level rollback principles.

Operations executes or coordinates rollback when runtime conditions justify it.

---

## Backup and Restore

Where FamilyOS stores persistent information, backup and restore capabilities may become operational requirements.

A backup is useful only if restoration can be performed successfully.

Therefore:

```text
Backup
   +
Restore Validation
   =
Recoverable Backup
```

---

## Recovery Objectives

As operational requirements mature, FamilyOS MAY define:

* Recovery Time Objective;
* Recovery Point Objective.

Formal objectives should only be introduced where meaningful business or family requirements justify them.

---

## Operational Security

Operational interfaces and actions can affect platform security.

Privileged operational actions SHOULD follow the Security Framework.

Examples include:

```text
Configuration Change
Service Control
Diagnostic Access
Secret Rotation
Recovery Operation
```

---

## Operational Access

Operational access should follow:

```text
Authenticated Actor
       ↓
Authorized Operation
       ↓
Controlled Execution
       ↓
Operational Evidence
```

Administrative convenience must not silently bypass security boundaries.

---

## Operational Data Protection

Operational evidence may itself contain sensitive information.

Logs, diagnostics, incident reports, and configuration snapshots SHOULD respect:

* data minimization;
* access control;
* secret redaction;
* retention requirements.

---

## Operational Observability

Operations consumes:

```text
Logs
Metrics
Traces
Health Signals
Security Events
```

through the Observability Framework.

Telemetry should support operational decisions rather than exist merely because it can be collected.

---

## Alerting

Alerts SHOULD represent conditions requiring attention or action.

The preferred principle is:

```text
Actionable Condition
        ↓
Alert
```

rather than:

```text
Every Observable Event
        ↓
Alert
```

Excessive alerts reduce operational effectiveness.

---

## Automation

Repetitive and deterministic operational procedures SHOULD be candidates for automation.

Examples include:

* validation;
* startup checks;
* health checks;
* deployment verification;
* recovery verification;
* configuration checks;
* scheduled maintenance.

Automation should reduce error without obscuring system behavior.

---

## Safe Automation

Operational automation must define:

* preconditions;
* actions;
* expected results;
* failure behavior;
* evidence;
* recovery path.

Automation without predictable failure behavior creates operational risk.

---

## Human Control

Not every operational decision should be automated.

Human review remains appropriate for:

* ambiguous incidents;
* destructive recovery;
* significant security events;
* high-risk configuration changes;
* uncertain data recovery.

FamilyOS should automate deterministic mechanics while preserving human judgment where required.

---

## Operational Evidence

Operational actions SHOULD produce sufficient evidence to answer:

```text
What happened?

When?

To which component?

Under which version?

What action was performed?

What was the result?
```

Evidence should remain structured where practical.

---

## Change Awareness

Operational diagnosis requires understanding recent change.

Useful change information may include:

* release version;
* configuration change;
* plugin change;
* dependency change;
* infrastructure change.

Many operational failures occur near change boundaries.

---

## Operational Governance

Operational governance defines how significant operational decisions are controlled.

Governance may apply to:

* production configuration;
* privileged access;
* incident severity;
* risk acceptance;
* recovery procedures;
* operational changes.

Governance should remain lightweight until operational complexity requires expansion.

---

## Operational Ownership

Operationally significant capabilities SHOULD have identifiable ownership.

Ownership answers:

```text
Who understands this component?

Who can approve significant changes?

Who responds when it fails?
```

In a small project, these responsibilities may belong to the same person.

The conceptual ownership model still remains useful.

---

## Documentation

Operational documentation should focus on actionable knowledge.

Examples include:

* startup requirements;
* health semantics;
* dependencies;
* recovery procedures;
* known failure modes.

Documentation that merely repeats implementation details should be avoided.

---

## Runbooks

A runbook describes a repeatable operational procedure.

A useful runbook should contain:

```text
Condition
   ↓
Diagnosis
   ↓
Action
   ↓
Verification
   ↓
Escalation / Recovery
```

Runbooks should be introduced for meaningful operational procedures rather than every possible action.

---

## Operational Anti-Patterns

FamilyOS SHOULD avoid several common operational anti-patterns.

### Manual-Only Operation

Critical repetitive procedures should not depend indefinitely on undocumented manual steps.

### Hidden Configuration

Operational behavior should not depend on unknown local state.

### Restart as Universal Recovery

Restarting may temporarily hide root causes.

It should not replace diagnosis.

### Alert Everything

Excessive alerting creates noise and reduces response quality.

### Monitor Without Action

Telemetry without an operational purpose creates cost without reliability.

### Automation Without Verification

An automated action is incomplete until its result can be verified.

### Production-Only Knowledge

Critical operational behavior should not be discoverable only after production failure.

---

## Failure as a Design Input

FamilyOS SHOULD assume that:

```text
Dependencies Fail

Networks Fail

Configuration Is Sometimes Wrong

Credentials Expire

Resources Become Exhausted

Software Contains Defects

Humans Make Mistakes
```

Operational architecture exists because failure is normal in real systems.

---

## Graceful Failure

Where possible, FamilyOS should transform uncontrolled failure into controlled state.

For example:

```text
Unexpected Exception
       ↓
Controlled Failure
       ↓
Observable Evidence
       ↓
Known Operational State
```

---

## Recovery Over Perfection

The framework does not assume every failure can be prevented.

Instead, FamilyOS should balance:

```text
Prevention
    +
Detection
    +
Containment
    +
Recovery
```

Reliable recovery is often more valuable than attempting to eliminate every possible failure.

---

## Operational Maturity

FamilyOS operational maturity should evolve incrementally.

A conceptual progression is:

```text
Level 1
Manual but Documented

Level 2
Observable

Level 3
Repeatable

Level 4
Automated

Level 5
Adaptive
```

FamilyOS does not need to reach the highest level for every capability.

---

## Initial Operational Target

The initial operational target is deliberately modest.

FamilyOS should be able to:

```text
Start Predictably
      ↓
Validate Configuration
      ↓
Report Health
      ↓
Expose Useful Evidence
      ↓
Detect Important Failure
      ↓
Recover Predictably
```

This provides a strong foundation without excessive infrastructure.

---

## Future Evolution

The Operations Framework may later support:

* richer service management;
* automated remediation;
* distributed deployment;
* formal SLOs;
* capacity forecasting;
* disaster recovery;
* advanced operational analytics;
* automated incident correlation.

These capabilities should be introduced only when concrete operational needs justify them.

---

## Design Constraints

EPIC-OPS-001 adopts the following constraints:

```text
Keep the Framework Compact

Reuse Existing FamilyOS Foundations

Avoid Infrastructure Prematurity

Prefer Explicit Runtime Contracts

Automate Stable Procedures

Preserve Human Control for High-Risk Actions

Make Failure Observable

Make Recovery Verifiable
```

---

## Framework Boundaries

EPIC-OPS-001 defines operational architecture.

It does not attempt to redefine:

* application architecture;
* testing architecture;
* build architecture;
* release governance;
* observability architecture;
* security architecture;
* plugin compliance.

Instead, it connects these foundations at runtime.

---

## Operational Foundation

The complete conceptual foundation is:

```text
Released Artifact
       ↓
Validated Configuration
       ↓
Controlled Runtime
       ↓
Health + Observability
       ↓
Operational Evaluation
       ↓
Action
       ↓
Recovery / Adjustment
       ↓
Verification
       ↓
Evidence
       ↓
Engineering Improvement
```

---

## Success Criteria

The Operations Framework succeeds when FamilyOS has clear answers for:

```text
How does runtime start?

How is readiness determined?

How is health represented?

Which dependencies are critical?

How does degradation work?

How are incidents handled?

How is recovery performed?

How is recovery verified?

How is performance evaluated?

How is capacity managed?

How are privileged operational actions protected?

How is operational evidence produced?

Which procedures should be automated?

How does runtime experience improve engineering?
```

---

## Expected Outcome

After EPIC-OPS-001, FamilyOS should possess a coherent operational model that is:

```text
Explicit
Observable
Secure
Reliable
Recoverable
Diagnosable
Automatable
Testable
Proportional
```

The framework establishes the bridge between released FamilyOS software and sustainable real-world operation.

---

## Conclusion

EPIC-OPS-001 establishes operations as the final part of the FamilyOS engineering lifecycle rather than an activity performed after engineering is complete.

The central operational principle is:

> A FamilyOS capability is not operationally complete merely because it runs; it must be possible to understand its state, detect meaningful failure, recover predictably, verify recovery, and feed operational evidence back into engineering.

This vision provides the foundation for the remaining Operations Framework documents and for future FamilyOS runtime implementation.
