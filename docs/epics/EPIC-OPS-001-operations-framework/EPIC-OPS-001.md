## 1. Purpose

EPIC-OPS-001 defines the canonical FamilyOS Operations Framework.

The framework establishes the operational principles, architectural boundaries, lifecycle controls, runtime management practices, service-management expectations, incident-response mechanisms, recovery requirements, capacity-management principles, performance and reliability expectations, operational-security requirements, governance controls, automation principles, and validation requirements necessary to operate FamilyOS systems safely and predictably.

The framework provides the authoritative operations model for FamilyOS.

It exists to ensure that operational activities are:

* explicit;
* controlled;
* observable;
* recoverable;
* secure;
* validated;
* auditable where required;
* evidence-based;
* automation-compatible;
* reproducible where practical;
* aligned with the wider FamilyOS engineering framework.

The framework does not treat operations as an informal activity performed after software delivery.

Operations are part of the engineering lifecycle.

---

## 2. Framework Intent

The intent of EPIC-OPS-001 is to establish a stable operational foundation capable of supporting FamilyOS as the platform evolves from local development environments toward increasingly complex runtime and deployment models.

The framework defines how FamilyOS reasons about:

* operational ownership;
* runtime environments;
* service lifecycle management;
* operational state;
* configuration;
* health and readiness;
* dependencies;
* incidents;
* escalation;
* recovery;
* rollback;
* capacity;
* performance;
* reliability;
* operational security;
* operational governance;
* automation;
* operational evidence;
* validation;
* release integration.

The framework is intentionally infrastructure-neutral.

It defines operational contracts before prescribing particular infrastructure technologies.

---

## 3. Historical Release

EPIC-OPS-001 was historically completed and published as:

```text
Framework:       EPIC-OPS-001
Version:         5.1.0
Tag:             v5.1.0-operations-framework
Commit:          1e4104000f719a030b1ae72839708e0a877960d1
Publication:     Published
```

The historical annotated tag is immutable.

The current control-document normalization SHALL NOT:

* move the historical tag;
* recreate the historical tag;
* replace the historical commit;
* rewrite historical release evidence;
* modify the semantic meaning of version 5.1.0;
* represent post-release normalization as the original release event.

The historical release remains authoritative evidence of the original framework publication.

---

## 4. Historical Documentation Model

The historical EPIC used the compact FamilyOS framework-documentation model.

It consisted of ten numbered documents:

```text
00-EPIC.md
01-Context-and-Vision.md
02-Operations-Principles.md
03-Operations-Architecture.md
04-Runtime-and-Service-Management.md
05-Incident-Response-and-Recovery.md
06-Capacity-Performance-and-Reliability.md
07-Operational-Security-and-Governance.md
08-Implementation-and-Automation.md
09-Validation-and-Release.md
```

Historical structure:

```text
Numbered Documents:  10
Control Documents:    0
Canonical Files:     10
Canonical Range:     00-09
Documentation Model: Compact
```

These numbered documents constitute the historical normative framework baseline.

---

## 5. Normalized Documentation Model

Post-release normalization adds the canonical FamilyOS control-document layer without replacing the historical numbered documents.

The normalized structure is:

```text
Numbered Documents:  10
Control Documents:    7
Canonical Files:     17
Canonical Range:     00-09
```

The seven control documents are:

```text
EPIC-OPS-001.md
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

The control layer provides:

* machine-readable framework metadata;
* repository inventory;
* lifecycle state;
* release history;
* validation evidence;
* revision history;
* navigation;
* governance information.

The addition of these documents does not create a new framework version.

---

## 6. Canonical Document Inventory

The complete normalized EPIC consists of the following seventeen files.

### 6.1 Numbered Framework Documents

```text
00-EPIC.md
01-Context-and-Vision.md
02-Operations-Principles.md
03-Operations-Architecture.md
04-Runtime-and-Service-Management.md
05-Incident-Response-and-Recovery.md
06-Capacity-Performance-and-Reliability.md
07-Operational-Security-and-Governance.md
08-Implementation-and-Automation.md
09-Validation-and-Release.md
```

### 6.2 Control Documents

```text
EPIC-OPS-001.md
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

### 6.3 Canonical Contract

```text
Canonical Range:      00-09
Numbered Documents:   10
Control Documents:     7
Canonical Files:      17
```

The filesystem inventory and `EPIC.yaml` SHALL agree with this contract.

---

## 7. Framework Objectives

EPIC-OPS-001 establishes the following objectives.

### 7.1 Operational Consistency

FamilyOS operational behavior SHOULD follow explicit and repeatable processes rather than undocumented operator knowledge.

### 7.2 Runtime Control

Runtime environments and services SHALL have explicit lifecycle, configuration, health, readiness, and dependency expectations.

### 7.3 Recoverability

Operational failure SHALL be treated as an expected engineering condition.

Recovery mechanisms SHALL therefore be designed, documented, and validated.

### 7.4 Reliability

Capacity, performance, and reliability SHALL be treated as operational engineering concerns rather than incidental runtime properties.

### 7.5 Operational Security

Operational processes SHALL preserve FamilyOS security boundaries.

Operational convenience SHALL NOT bypass security controls.

### 7.6 Evidence

Important operational actions and validation activities SHOULD produce evidence appropriate to their impact.

### 7.7 Automation

Repeatable operational activities SHOULD be automatable where automation improves consistency, safety, traceability, or reliability.

Automation SHALL remain subject to validation and security controls.

---

## 8. Operations Principles

The framework is governed by a set of foundational principles.

These include:

* explicit ownership;
* controlled change;
* validated runtime configuration;
* observable operation;
* recoverability;
* evidence-based operation;
* automation with validation;
* security by default;
* infrastructure neutrality;
* proportional complexity;
* repeatability;
* deterministic validation where practical.

These principles establish the behavioral foundation for FamilyOS operations.

---

## 9. Operations Architecture

The Operations Framework separates operational concerns into explicit domains.

A conceptual model is:

```text
+--------------------------------------------------+
|                Operations Governance             |
+--------------------------------------------------+
| Operational Security | Validation | Evidence     |
+--------------------------------------------------+
| Incident Response    | Recovery   | Reliability  |
+--------------------------------------------------+
| Runtime Management   | Service Management        |
+--------------------------------------------------+
| Configuration | Dependencies | Health | Readiness|
+--------------------------------------------------+
|              Runtime Environment                 |
+--------------------------------------------------+
```

The model separates governance and policy from runtime mechanisms.

This prevents infrastructure-specific implementation details from becoming the framework itself.

---

## 10. Runtime Management

Runtime operation SHALL have explicit state.

Where applicable, runtime management includes:

* startup;
* initialization;
* configuration loading;
* configuration validation;
* dependency discovery;
* dependency validation;
* health evaluation;
* readiness evaluation;
* normal operation;
* degradation;
* maintenance;
* shutdown;
* recovery.

Runtime state SHOULD be machine-readable where practical.

Ambiguous runtime state SHOULD be avoided.

---

## 11. Service Management

FamilyOS services SHALL have defined operational lifecycle expectations.

A service may transition through states such as:

```text
DEFINED
   |
   v
CONFIGURED
   |
   v
STARTING
   |
   v
READY
   |
   v
RUNNING
   |
   +----------+
   |          |
   v          v
DEGRADED    FAILED
   |          |
   +----+-----+
        |
        v
   RECOVERING
        |
        v
      READY
```

Exact implementation details may vary.

The operational meaning of service state SHALL remain explicit.

---

## 12. Configuration Management

Operational configuration SHALL be controlled.

Configuration SHOULD be:

* explicit;
* validated;
* environment-aware;
* reviewable;
* reproducible where practical;
* protected when sensitive;
* traceable where required.

Invalid configuration SHOULD fail safely.

Configuration mechanisms SHALL NOT become an uncontrolled path around architectural or security constraints.

---

## 13. Health and Readiness

Health and readiness are distinct concepts.

Health answers whether a runtime component is functioning according to its operational expectations.

Readiness answers whether that component is currently capable of accepting its intended workload or responsibility.

A component may therefore be:

```text
Healthy + Ready
Healthy + Not Ready
Degraded + Ready
Degraded + Not Ready
Failed
```

Health and readiness mechanisms SHOULD provide sufficient evidence for operational decisions.

---

## 14. Dependency Management

Runtime dependencies SHALL be treated explicitly.

Operational dependency management SHOULD consider:

* dependency identity;
* availability;
* compatibility;
* configuration;
* connectivity;
* authorization;
* timeout behavior;
* failure behavior;
* recovery behavior;
* degradation behavior.

A dependency failure SHALL NOT automatically imply uncontrolled system failure.

Where practical, degradation and recovery strategies SHOULD be defined.

---

## 15. Incident Response

Operational incidents SHALL be handled through a structured process appropriate to their severity.

A generalized lifecycle is:

```text
Detection
   |
   v
Assessment
   |
   v
Classification
   |
   v
Containment
   |
   v
Recovery
   |
   v
Validation
   |
   v
Closure
   |
   v
Learning
```

Incident handling SHOULD preserve evidence required for diagnosis and improvement.

High-impact incidents SHOULD have explicit ownership.

---

## 16. Recovery

Recovery is not complete merely because a process or service has restarted.

Recovery SHALL include validation.

Where applicable, recovery validation SHOULD establish that:

* required services are available;
* dependencies are valid;
* runtime configuration is valid;
* required data remains consistent;
* security controls remain effective;
* health checks pass;
* readiness checks pass;
* expected functionality has been restored.

The framework therefore distinguishes:

```text
Restarted != Recovered
Restored  != Validated
Recovered = Restored + Validated
```

---

## 17. Rollback

Rollback is an operational recovery mechanism.

Rollback SHOULD be:

* intentional;
* controlled;
* version-aware;
* observable;
* validated;
* compatible with release governance.

Rollback SHALL NOT be assumed safe solely because a previous version existed.

State compatibility, configuration compatibility, data compatibility, and dependency compatibility may need validation.

---

## 18. Capacity

Capacity planning SHOULD be evidence-based.

Capacity decisions may consider:

* workload;
* concurrency;
* storage;
* memory;
* compute;
* network;
* dependency limits;
* latency;
* throughput;
* growth;
* operational margins.

The framework does not mandate premature infrastructure scaling.

Operational complexity SHOULD remain proportional to demonstrated need.

---

## 19. Performance

Performance is an operational property requiring measurable expectations.

Relevant indicators may include:

* latency;
* throughput;
* resource utilization;
* queue depth;
* startup time;
* recovery time;
* dependency response time;
* processing duration.

Performance evidence SHOULD be interpreted in context.

A single metric SHALL NOT automatically define operational health.

---

## 20. Reliability

Reliability concerns the ability of FamilyOS systems to provide expected behavior over time and under expected operating conditions.

Reliability engineering may include:

* failure detection;
* degradation strategies;
* recovery;
* retry policies;
* timeout policies;
* dependency isolation;
* capacity management;
* validation;
* operational evidence.

Reliability mechanisms SHALL remain compatible with security, quality, and release requirements.

---

## 21. Operational Security

Operations SHALL preserve the security boundaries established by the FamilyOS Security Framework.

Operational activities SHALL NOT create privileged bypass mechanisms merely for convenience.

Where applicable:

* protected operations require authorization;
* secrets SHALL NOT be exposed;
* sensitive configuration SHALL be protected;
* privileged operations SHOULD produce appropriate evidence;
* automation SHALL respect authorization boundaries;
* recovery SHALL preserve security controls.

Security remains authoritative for security policy.

Operations defines how those requirements are respected during runtime operation.

---

## 22. Operational Governance

Operational governance defines who may perform operational actions, under which conditions, and with what evidence.

Governance SHOULD distinguish between:

* routine operation;
* maintenance;
* privileged operation;
* incident response;
* emergency action;
* recovery;
* release-related operation.

The rigor of governance SHOULD be proportional to operational impact.

---

## 23. Automation

Automation SHOULD reduce:

* repetitive manual work;
* configuration drift;
* operator error;
* inconsistent execution;
* validation omissions.

Automation SHALL NOT reduce required safety controls.

A preferred model is:

```text
Input
  |
  v
Validate
  |
  v
Authorize
  |
  v
Execute
  |
  v
Observe
  |
  v
Validate Result
  |
  v
Record Evidence
```

High-impact automation SHOULD fail safely.

---

## 24. Operational Evidence

Operational evidence may include:

* validation results;
* runtime state;
* health results;
* readiness results;
* logs;
* metrics;
* traces;
* incident records;
* recovery records;
* release evidence;
* configuration fingerprints;
* automation results.

Evidence requirements SHALL remain proportional to operational and security risk.

Observability mechanisms remain governed by EPIC-OBS-001.

---

## 25. Framework Integration

Operations does not operate independently from the wider FamilyOS engineering architecture.

The authority boundaries are:

```text
Engineering Foundation    EPIC-ENG-001
Testing Framework         EPIC-TST-001
Quality Framework         EPIC-QLT-001
Build Framework           EPIC-BLD-001
Release Framework         EPIC-REL-001
Observability Framework   EPIC-OBS-001
Security Framework        EPIC-SEC-001
Operations Framework      EPIC-OPS-001
```

EPIC-OPS-001 owns operational concerns.

It SHALL NOT redefine authoritative contracts owned by another framework.

---

## 26. Testing Integration

Operational mechanisms SHOULD be testable.

Relevant testing may include:

* runtime lifecycle tests;
* configuration validation tests;
* dependency failure tests;
* health-check tests;
* readiness tests;
* recovery tests;
* rollback tests;
* automation tests;
* incident-workflow tests.

Testing authority remains with EPIC-TST-001.

---

## 27. Quality Integration

Operational quality includes more than successful execution.

Quality expectations may include:

* deterministic behavior;
* safe failure;
* clear state;
* recoverability;
* evidence;
* maintainability;
* predictable automation;
* documented ownership.

Quality authority remains with EPIC-QLT-001.

---

## 28. Build Integration

Operations consumes artifacts produced through the FamilyOS Build Framework.

Operational processes SHALL NOT silently modify validated build artifacts in ways that invalidate their provenance or integrity.

Build authority remains with EPIC-BLD-001.

---

## 29. Release Integration

Operational deployment and runtime transition SHALL remain compatible with release governance.

Release integration may include:

* readiness verification;
* deployment preparation;
* runtime configuration validation;
* release activation;
* post-release health verification;
* rollback readiness;
* publication evidence.

Release authority remains with EPIC-REL-001.

---

## 30. Observability Integration

Operational decisions depend on trustworthy observability.

EPIC-OPS-001 consumes observability capabilities such as:

* logs;
* metrics;
* traces;
* health information;
* runtime signals;
* incident evidence.

EPIC-OBS-001 remains authoritative for observability architecture and telemetry governance.

---

## 31. Security Integration

Operations consumes security policies and controls established by EPIC-SEC-001.

This includes:

* identity;
* authentication;
* authorization;
* secrets;
* cryptographic controls;
* threat and risk considerations;
* compliance controls.

Operations SHALL implement or consume those controls without redefining their authority.

---

## 32. Infrastructure Neutrality

EPIC-OPS-001 does not require a particular:

* cloud provider;
* container platform;
* orchestrator;
* operating system;
* monitoring vendor;
* deployment platform;
* infrastructure-as-code tool.

Technology choices may evolve independently while the operational contracts remain stable.

This separation protects the framework from unnecessary technology coupling.

---

## 33. Proportional Complexity

FamilyOS SHALL avoid operational infrastructure that exceeds demonstrated requirements.

The framework therefore favors:

```text
Need
  |
  v
Evidence
  |
  v
Operational Requirement
  |
  v
Appropriate Mechanism
  |
  v
Validation
```

rather than:

```text
Available Technology
  |
  v
Automatic Adoption
```

Operational sophistication SHOULD increase as operational requirements justify it.

---

## 34. Failure Model

Operational failure SHALL be expected.

Possible failure categories include:

* invalid configuration;
* missing dependency;
* unavailable dependency;
* authorization failure;
* runtime crash;
* resource exhaustion;
* performance degradation;
* storage failure;
* network failure;
* automation failure;
* deployment failure;
* data-integrity failure;
* security incident.

The framework requires controlled detection, response, recovery, and validation appropriate to the failure class.

---

## 35. Safe Failure

Where practical, operational mechanisms SHOULD fail safely.

Safe failure may mean:

* rejecting invalid configuration;
* refusing unsafe startup;
* preventing unauthorized execution;
* entering a degraded state;
* stopping unsafe automation;
* preserving evidence;
* triggering recovery procedures.

Failing visibly and safely is preferable to silently entering an unknown operational state.

---

## 36. Operational State

Operational state SHOULD be explicit and understandable.

Examples include:

```text
UNKNOWN
INITIALIZING
READY
RUNNING
DEGRADED
MAINTENANCE
FAILED
RECOVERING
STOPPED
```

Not every component requires every state.

State models SHOULD remain as simple as practical while preserving operational meaning.

---

## 37. Validation Philosophy

Operational validation establishes evidence that the system satisfies the required operational contracts.

Validation may include:

* structural validation;
* configuration validation;
* runtime validation;
* health validation;
* readiness validation;
* recovery validation;
* security validation;
* automation validation;
* repository validation;
* release validation.

Validation SHALL distinguish evidence from assumption.

---

## 38. Repository Validation

The normalized EPIC repository SHALL validate:

```text
Canonical numbered range       00-09
Numbered documents             10
Control documents               7
Canonical files                17
Empty canonical files           0
Historical tag                 immutable
Historical commit              preserved
```

The normalized control documents SHALL describe the current repository state without rewriting the historical release state.

---

## 39. Quality Gates

Current repository revalidation requires the standard FamilyOS engineering quality gates.

At minimum:

```text
ruff check .
mypy src
pytest -q
git diff --check
```

All required gates SHALL pass before post-release normalization is declared validated.

---

## 40. Historical Integrity

The historical release contract is:

```text
EPIC:                    EPIC-OPS-001
Framework Version:       5.1.0
Historical Tag:          v5.1.0-operations-framework
Historical Commit:       1e4104000f719a030b1ae72839708e0a877960d1
Historical Publication:  Published
Historical Tag Policy:   Immutable
```

Post-release control-document normalization creates new repository history after this commit.

It SHALL NOT alter the historical release object.

---

## 41. Post-Release Normalization

The current activity adds the missing control-document layer.

This activity:

* preserves the ten numbered framework documents;
* adds seven control documents;
* preserves framework version 5.1.0;
* preserves the historical tag;
* preserves the historical commit;
* does not introduce a new framework release;
* records current repository evidence;
* aligns EPIC-OPS-001 with the canonical FamilyOS EPIC governance model.

This activity is therefore classified as post-release normalization and revalidation.

---

## 42. Revalidation Requirements

Post-release revalidation SHALL establish:

1. the seventeen-file normalized inventory exists;
2. the ten historical numbered documents remain present;
3. no numbered document was unintentionally modified;
4. all seven control documents exist;
5. `EPIC.yaml` parses successfully;
6. metadata agrees with the filesystem;
7. local Markdown references are valid;
8. unresolved blocking placeholders are absent;
9. the historical tag resolves to the historical commit;
10. the remote historical tag resolves to the same commit;
11. repository quality gates pass;
12. control documents agree on the final state;
13. the normalization commit is published;
14. the final repository state is clean.

---

## 43. Numbered-Document Preservation

During control-document normalization, the historical numbered documents SHALL remain unchanged unless an independently justified corrective change is explicitly reviewed.

The normalization activity itself SHALL NOT modify:

```text
00-EPIC.md
01-Context-and-Vision.md
02-Operations-Principles.md
03-Operations-Architecture.md
04-Runtime-and-Service-Management.md
05-Incident-Response-and-Recovery.md
06-Capacity-Performance-and-Reliability.md
07-Operational-Security-and-Governance.md
08-Implementation-and-Automation.md
09-Validation-and-Release.md
```

This preserves historical semantic integrity.

---

## 44. Machine-Readable Contract

`EPIC.yaml` is the machine-readable control contract for the normalized repository state.

It SHALL describe:

* EPIC identity;
* framework version;
* lifecycle status;
* deliverables;
* current structure;
* historical structure;
* validation baseline;
* historical release;
* repository metadata;
* governance requirements;
* validation requirements;
* framework boundaries;
* normalization state;
* closure state.

Markdown control documents SHALL remain semantically consistent with this contract.

---

## 45. Closure Model

EPIC closure has two distinct dimensions.

### 45.1 Historical Framework Closure

The framework itself was completed and released at:

```text
v5.1.0-operations-framework
```

This historical closure is already established.

### 45.2 Current Repository Revalidation

The normalized control-document layer requires current repository revalidation.

That evidence has now been executed and recorded, while the historical framework completion remains preserved.

This distinction prevents historical facts from being rewritten merely because governance documentation is being normalized later.

---

## 46. Current Revalidation State

At creation of the normalized control-document layer, the expected machine-readable state is:

```text
Framework Status:        Completed
Historical Publication: Published
Historical Tag:          v5.1.0-operations-framework
Historical Tag Policy:   Immutable

Documentation:           Completed
Repository Validation:   Validated
Final Revalidation:      Validated
```

These repository-validation states have now been replaced with validated states because current evidence has passed.

---

## 47. Completion Criteria

Post-release normalization is complete when:

* all seven control documents exist;
* all control documents are semantically aligned;
* `EPIC.yaml` matches the filesystem;
* all validation checks pass;
* historical tag integrity passes locally;
* historical tag integrity passes remotely;
* numbered documents remain unchanged;
* required quality gates pass;
* normalization changes are committed;
* the branch is published;
* local and remote branch heads agree;
* the working tree is clean;
* final validation state is recorded.

---

## 48. Final Target State

After successful normalization and revalidation, the expected state is:

```text
EPIC:                    EPIC-OPS-001
Title:                   Operations Framework
Framework Version:       5.1.0
Framework Status:        Completed

Canonical Range:         00-09
Numbered Documents:      10
Control Documents:        7
Canonical Files:         17

Historical Publication:  Published
Historical Tag:          v5.1.0-operations-framework
Historical Tag Commit:   1e4104000f719a030b1ae72839708e0a877960d1
Historical Tag Policy:   Immutable

Repository Validation:   Validated
Final Revalidation:      Validated
EPIC Closed:              True
```

---

## 49. Final Statement

EPIC-OPS-001 establishes the canonical FamilyOS Operations Framework.

It defines the operational foundation required to run FamilyOS systems through explicit runtime state, controlled service lifecycles, validated configuration, structured incident response, recoverable failure handling, capacity and performance management, reliability engineering, operational security, governance, automation, evidence, and validation.

The historical framework release remains:

```text
v5.1.0-operations-framework
```

at:

```text
