# Operations Framework

## EPIC-OPS-001

### Operations Architecture

### Overview

EPIC-OPS-001 — Operations Framework defines the runtime operational architecture for the FamilyOS ecosystem.

The Operations Architecture establishes how released FamilyOS software transitions into a controlled runtime environment and how that runtime is:

* configured;
* started;
* observed;
* evaluated;
* controlled;
* degraded;
* recovered;
* validated;
* improved.

The architecture connects the existing FamilyOS engineering foundations without creating duplicate operational mechanisms.

Its primary objective is to ensure that runtime behavior remains explicit, observable, secure, recoverable, and automatable.

---

## Architectural Objective

The Operations Architecture provides a common model for answering:

```text
What is running?

What should be running?

Which version is running?

Which configuration is active?

Which dependencies are required?

Is the runtime healthy?

Can it perform its intended responsibilities?

What happens when a dependency fails?

How can operational state be changed safely?

How is failure detected?

How is recovery performed?

How is recovery verified?

Which evidence proves the operational result?
```

These questions form the basis of FamilyOS operability.

---

## Architectural Position

Operations exists after controlled release and before runtime feedback returns to engineering.

```text
Engineering
    ↓
Testing
    ↓
Quality
    ↓
Build
    ↓
Release
    ↓
Operations
    ↓
Runtime
    ↓
Observability
    ↓
Operational Evidence
    ↓
Engineering Improvement
```

Operations therefore completes the FamilyOS engineering lifecycle.

---

## Architecture Principles

The Operations Architecture follows several core principles:

```text
Explicit Runtime State

Controlled Lifecycle

Validated Configuration

Observable Operation

Failure Isolation

Graceful Degradation

Predictable Recovery

Recovery Verification

Least Operational Privilege

Evidence-Driven Decisions

Automation of Stable Procedures

Proportional Complexity
```

These principles apply across operational components.

---

## Architectural Boundaries

The Operations Framework defines operational behavior without replacing existing FamilyOS frameworks.

The responsibility boundaries are:

```text
Build Framework
      ↓
Produces artifacts

Release Framework
      ↓
Approves artifacts

Operations Framework
      ↓
Runs and manages artifacts

Observability Framework
      ↓
Explains runtime behavior

Security Framework
      ↓
Protects runtime actions and information
```

Each framework retains its own responsibility.

---

## High-Level Operations Architecture

The conceptual FamilyOS operational architecture is:

```text
                    ┌──────────────────────┐
                    │   Released Artifact  │
                    └──────────┬───────────┘
                               │

                    ┌──────────────────────┐

                    └──────────┬───────────┘
                               │

                    └──────────┬───────────┘
                               │
                               ▼
                    ┌──────────────────────┐
                    │ Verification         │
                    └──────────┬───────────┘
                               │
                               ▼
                    ┌──────────────────────┐
                    │ Operational Evidence │
                    └──────────────────────┘
```

This architecture is conceptual.

It does not require each box to become an independent process, service, class, or infrastructure component.

---

## Runtime Boundary

The runtime boundary represents the transition from released software into active execution.

Inside this boundary may exist:

```text
FamilyOS Core

Application Services

Capabilities

Official Plugins

Third-Party Plugins

Repositories

Adapters

Workers

Schedulers

External Integration Clients
```

The operational architecture manages their runtime behavior without redefining their domain architecture.

---

## Runtime Identity

Every meaningful FamilyOS runtime SHOULD be identifiable.

Runtime identity may include:

```text
application
version
build
release
environment
instance
configuration revision
```

The exact representation depends on deployment architecture.

At minimum, operators should be able to determine which FamilyOS release is running.

---

## Artifact Traceability

Runtime execution SHOULD remain traceable to a released artifact.

The expected relationship is:

```text
Source Revision
      ↓
Build Artifact
      ↓
Release
      ↓
Deployment
      ↓
Runtime
```

This enables operational evidence to be associated with the software that produced it.

---

## Operational Unit

An operational unit is the smallest runtime element for which independent operational state is useful.

Examples may include:

* FamilyOS runtime process;
* plugin;
* background worker;
* scheduler;
* repository adapter;
* external integration;
* long-running capability.

Operational units are logical concepts.

They do not necessarily correspond to operating-system processes.

---

## Operational Unit Contract

An operationally managed unit SHOULD expose enough information to determine:

```text
Identity

Lifecycle State

Health

Dependencies

Configuration State

Failure State
```

Additional operational information may be exposed where justified.

---

## Runtime Component Model

A conceptual operational unit can be represented as:

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Operational Unit                │
│                                 │
│ Identity                        │
│ Configuration                   │
│ Dependencies                    │
│ Lifecycle                       │
│ Health                          │
│ Diagnostics                     │
│ Operational Actions             │
│ Evidence                        │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

The implementation should remain smaller than this model where possible.

---

## Runtime Lifecycle Architecture

Operational units follow controlled lifecycle transitions.

A general lifecycle is:

```text
CREATED
   ↓
CONFIGURING
   ↓
VALIDATING
   ↓
STARTING
   ↓
READY
   ↓
RUNNING
   ↓
STOPPING
   ↓
STOPPED
```

Failure may occur during any transition.

---

## Failure States

Operational units may additionally enter:

```text
DEGRADED

UNHEALTHY

FAILED
```

The exact state model should remain appropriate to component complexity.

FamilyOS MUST avoid creating unnecessary state machines where simple health semantics are sufficient.

---

## Lifecycle Transition Rules

Lifecycle transitions SHOULD be:

* explicit;
* deterministic where possible;
* observable;
* validated;
* failure-aware.

For example:

```text
STARTING
   ↓
Initialization Successful
   ↓
READY
```

while:

```text
STARTING
   ↓
Critical Dependency Missing
   ↓
FAILED
```

---

## Startup Architecture

Startup is an operational transition, not merely process creation.

A conceptual startup sequence is:

```text
Load Artifact
     ↓
Load Configuration
     ↓
Validate Configuration
     ↓
Resolve Required Dependencies
     ↓
Initialize Components
     ↓
Evaluate Readiness
     ↓
READY
```

A runtime MUST NOT report readiness before critical initialization succeeds.

---

## Startup Failure

Startup failure should result in an explicit operational state.

For example:

```text
Invalid Configuration
        ↓
Startup Validation Failure
        ↓
FAILED
        ↓
Diagnostic Evidence
```

Silent partial startup should be avoided.

---

## Shutdown Architecture

Shutdown SHOULD be controlled where stateful operations require it.

A conceptual shutdown sequence is:

```text
Shutdown Requested
        ↓
Stop Accepting New Work
        ↓
Complete or Cancel Active Work
        ↓
Flush Required State
        ↓
Release Resources
        ↓
STOPPED
```

Not every FamilyOS runtime will require every stage.

---

## Graceful Shutdown

Graceful shutdown aims to prevent:

* partial writes;
* abandoned operations;
* corrupted state;
* inconsistent external interactions;
* lost operational evidence.

Forced termination may remain necessary when graceful shutdown cannot complete.

---

## Configuration Architecture

Operational configuration is part of runtime architecture.

Configuration should flow through:

```text
Configuration Source
        ↓
Configuration Loading
        ↓
Schema / Contract Validation
        ↓
Security Validation
        ↓
Runtime Configuration
```

Invalid critical configuration should prevent unsafe execution.

---

## Configuration Sources

FamilyOS configuration may originate from:

* files;
* environment variables;
* command-line parameters;
* secure providers;
* platform configuration services.

Core architecture SHOULD remain independent of a single configuration source.

---

## Configuration Contract

Operationally significant configuration SHOULD have explicit semantics.

A conceptual configuration contract may define:

```text
name
type
required
default
validation
sensitivity
runtime_mutability
```

The implementation need not expose all fields unless useful.

---

## Configuration Validation

Configuration validation should occur as early as practical.

The preferred pattern is:

```text
Configuration
      ↓
Validation
      ↓
Valid
      ↓
Runtime
```

rather than:

```text
Configuration
      ↓
Runtime
      ↓
Unexpected Failure Later
```

---

## Security-Sensitive Configuration

Security-sensitive configuration is governed by EPIC-SEC-001.

Examples include:

* credentials;
* secret references;
* authentication settings;
* authorization policy;
* cryptographic configuration;
* privileged integration settings.

Secrets MUST NOT be exposed through ordinary operational diagnostics.

---

## Configuration Mutability

Configuration may be:

```text
Static

Startup-Time

Runtime-Mutable
```

Runtime mutation should only be supported when a concrete operational requirement exists.

Unnecessary runtime mutability increases complexity and risk.

---

## Configuration Change

A controlled configuration change follows:

```text
Proposed Configuration
        ↓
Validation
        ↓
Authorization
        ↓
Application
        ↓
Runtime Evaluation
        ↓
Verification
        ↓
Evidence
```

High-risk changes may require explicit human approval.

---

## Desired State

Desired state represents the intended operational condition.

Examples include:

```text
Runtime should be running.

Plugin should be enabled.

Integration should be disabled.

Worker count should equal configured value.
```

Desired state may be represented implicitly in simple deployments.

---

## Actual State

Actual state represents observed runtime reality.

For example:

```text
Desired State: READY
Actual State:  DEGRADED
```

The difference between desired and actual state is operationally significant.

---

## Reconciliation

A reconciliation mechanism attempts to move actual state toward desired state.

Conceptually:

```text
Desired State
      ↓
Compare
      ↑
Actual State
      ↓
Difference
      ↓
Action
      ↓
Verification
```

FamilyOS does not initially require a continuous orchestration system.

The model remains useful for both manual and automated operations.

---

## Health Architecture

Health represents the operational condition of a unit.

A minimal health model is:

```text
HEALTHY
DEGRADED
UNHEALTHY
UNKNOWN
```

Health should communicate actionable runtime condition.

---

## Health Dimensions

Health may consider:

```text
Internal State

Critical Dependencies

Resource Availability

Configuration Validity

Execution Failures

Security Conditions
```

Not every observable metric belongs in health evaluation.

---

## Health Aggregation

A runtime containing multiple components may aggregate health.

Conceptually:

```text
Core            HEALTHY
Repository      HEALTHY
Plugin A        HEALTHY
Plugin B        DEGRADED
Integration C   UNAVAILABLE
                     │
                     ▼
Runtime          DEGRADED
```

Aggregation rules must remain explicit.

---

## Health Propagation

Failure should propagate according to dependency criticality.

For example:

```text
Optional Integration
      ↓
UNAVAILABLE
      ↓
Runtime DEGRADED
```

while:

```text
Critical Repository
      ↓
UNAVAILABLE
      ↓
Runtime UNHEALTHY
```

---

## Readiness Architecture

Readiness determines whether a unit can perform its intended operational responsibilities.

Readiness may depend on:

* initialization completion;
* configuration validity;
* critical dependency availability;
* required security state;
* required repository availability.

Readiness should remain distinct from liveness.

---

## Liveness Architecture

Liveness indicates whether a unit remains capable of progressing.

A runtime may be:

```text
Alive
but
Not Ready
```

or:

```text
Alive
but
Degraded
```

This distinction prevents simplistic health interpretation.

---

## Dependency Architecture

Operational dependencies SHOULD be identifiable.

A conceptual dependency relationship is:

```text
Operational Unit
      │
      ├── Critical Dependency
      ├── Optional Dependency
      └── Conditional Dependency
```

Dependency classification affects failure behavior.

---

## Critical Dependency

Failure of a critical dependency prevents essential operation.

The expected behavior may be:

```text
Dependency Failure
       ↓
Readiness Lost
       ↓
UNHEALTHY
```

or startup failure.

---

## Optional Dependency

Failure of an optional dependency should not unnecessarily terminate unrelated capabilities.

The preferred behavior is:

```text
Optional Dependency Failure
          ↓
Affected Capability Disabled
          ↓
Runtime DEGRADED
```

---

## Conditional Dependency

A conditional dependency is required only when a particular capability or configuration is active.

This allows FamilyOS to avoid unnecessary runtime requirements.

---

## External Dependencies

External dependencies represent stronger operational boundaries.

Examples include:

* external APIs;
* identity providers;
* storage services;
* messaging systems;
* external databases.

External dependencies should be protected by:

* timeouts;
* bounded retries;
* failure isolation;
* observability;
* security controls.

---

## Timeout Architecture

External operations SHOULD define bounded execution where indefinite waiting would create operational risk.

Conceptually:

```text
Request
   ↓
Bounded Wait
   ↓
Success
   OR
Timeout
```

Timeout behavior should be observable.

---

## Retry Architecture

Retries may improve resilience for transient failures.

However:

```text
Retry
   ≠
Infinite Retry
```

Retries SHOULD be:

* bounded;
* observable;
* appropriate to operation semantics;
* safe regarding duplicate execution.

---

## Retry Amplification

Uncontrolled retries can increase system failure.

The pattern:

```text
Dependency Failure
       ↓
Immediate Unlimited Retries
       ↓
Additional Load
       ↓
Worse Failure
```

must be avoided.

---

## Idempotency

Operations that may be retried SHOULD consider idempotency.

An idempotent operation can safely produce the intended result when repeated.

Where idempotency cannot be guaranteed, retry behavior must account for duplicate effects.

---

## Failure Isolation Architecture

FamilyOS should contain failure within the smallest practical operational boundary.

Conceptually:

```text
Plugin Failure
     ↓
Plugin Unavailable
     ↓
Core Continues
```

where architecture allows.

---

## Failure Domains

Potential failure domains include:

```text
Process

Plugin

Capability

Repository

Worker

Integration

External Dependency
```

Failure-domain boundaries should reflect actual runtime architecture.

---

## Graceful Degradation

Graceful degradation allows reduced service instead of complete failure.

A conceptual transition is:

```text
HEALTHY
   ↓
Optional Capability Failure
   ↓
DEGRADED
   ↓
Core Responsibilities Continue
```

Degradation should remain visible through observability.

---

## Circuit-Breaking Concept

Where repeated external failures create operational risk, FamilyOS MAY introduce circuit-breaking behavior.

Conceptually:

```text
Repeated Failure
      ↓
Temporarily Stop Requests
      ↓
Recovery Interval
      ↓
Probe
      ↓
Resume or Remain Isolated
```

This capability should only be introduced where justified.

---

## Resource Architecture

Runtime resources may include:

```text
CPU

Memory

Storage

File Handles

Network Connections

Database Connections

Worker Slots

External API Quotas
```

Operational architecture should prevent uncontrolled consumption where practical.

---

## Bounded Resources

Queues, worker pools, retries, caches, and buffers SHOULD have intentional bounds when unbounded growth creates reliability risk.

The principle is:

```text
Known Capacity
     ↓
Predictable Behavior
```

rather than:

```text
Unlimited Growth
     ↓
Resource Exhaustion
```

---

## Capacity Architecture

Capacity represents the ability of available resources to support workload.

Conceptually:

```text
Available Resources
        ↓
Operational Capacity
        ↓
Current Workload
        ↓
Capacity Margin
```

FamilyOS initially requires measurement and awareness rather than complex capacity orchestration.

---

## Performance Architecture

Performance signals should be associated with meaningful operations.

Important dimensions may include:

* latency;
* throughput;
* execution duration;
* queue depth;
* resource utilization;
* failure rate.

Performance data should use the Observability Framework.

---

## Operational Baselines

A baseline represents expected operational behavior under known conditions.

For example:

```text
Operation
    ↓
Expected Duration Range
    ↓
Measured Duration
    ↓
Comparison
```

Baselines can support regression detection.

---

## Observability Integration

Operations MUST consume the EPIC-OBS-001 architecture.

The relationship is:

```text
Runtime
   ↓
Logs + Metrics + Traces + Health
   ↓
Observability
   ↓
Operational Evaluation
```

Operations does not create a second telemetry pipeline.

---

## Operational Signals

Useful operational signals include:

```text
Runtime State

Health State

Readiness

Dependency Status

Error Rate

Latency

Resource Utilization

Security Events

Release Identity
```

Signals should support decisions.

---

## Correlation

Operational evidence SHOULD support correlation where practical.

A common correlation model may connect:

```text
Release
   ↓
Runtime
   ↓
Request / Operation
   ↓
Telemetry
   ↓
Incident
```

This allows diagnosis across framework boundaries.

---

## Operational Event

A conceptual operational event may contain:

```text
event_name
timestamp
component
runtime_version
state
outcome
reason
correlation_id
```

Sensitive values must remain excluded according to EPIC-SEC-001.

---

## Alert Architecture

Alerts represent actionable operational conditions.

The architecture is:

```text
Runtime Signal
      ↓
Evaluation Rule
      ↓
Operational Condition
      ↓
Alert
      ↓
Action
```

Alerts should not simply mirror every event.

---

## Alert Quality

A useful alert should help answer:

```text
What happened?

What is affected?

How severe is it?

What evidence exists?

What action should be considered?
```

Alerts without actionable context create operational noise.

---

## Incident Architecture

An incident is a managed operational failure or significant degradation.

The conceptual architecture is:

```text
Detection
   ↓
Incident Creation
   ↓
Classification
   ↓
Diagnosis
   ↓
Containment
   ↓
Mitigation
   ↓
Recovery
   ↓
Verification
   ↓
Closure
   ↓
Learning
```

The process should remain lightweight for small incidents.

---

## Incident Identity

Significant incidents SHOULD have an identifier when tracking across multiple actions or evidence sources is useful.

A conceptual identifier might be:

```text
INC-YYYY-NNNN
```

The exact format is an implementation decision.

---

## Incident Severity

A minimal severity model is:

```text
LOW
MEDIUM
HIGH
CRITICAL
```

Severity should consider:

* impact;
* scope;
* urgency;
* security implications;
* recoverability.

---

## Incident State

A conceptual incident state model may include:

```text
OPEN
INVESTIGATING
MITIGATING
RECOVERING
RESOLVED
CLOSED
```

FamilyOS should avoid unnecessary workflow complexity.

---

## Incident Evidence

Incident evidence may aggregate:

```text
Runtime Identity

Release Version

Health State

Logs

Metrics

Traces

Security Events

Configuration Context

Actions

Recovery Results
```

Sensitive information remains governed by the Security Framework.

---

## Recovery Architecture

Recovery returns an operational unit to an acceptable state.

A recovery flow is:

```text
Failure
   ↓
Diagnosis
   ↓
Recovery Decision
   ↓
Recovery Action
   ↓
Runtime Evaluation
   ↓
Functional Verification
   ↓
Recovery Confirmed
```

Recovery without verification is incomplete.

---

## Recovery Strategies

Potential recovery strategies include:

```text
Restart

Retry

Reconfigure

Dependency Restoration

Plugin Isolation

Rollback

Restore

Failover
```

Not all strategies are required by the initial FamilyOS implementation.

---

## Recovery Selection

Recovery strategy should reflect failure type.

For example:

```text
Invalid Configuration
        ↓
Correct Configuration
```

rather than blindly restarting.

Similarly:

```text
Bad Release
    ↓
Rollback
```

may be more appropriate than repeated restart.

---

## Rollback Integration

Release rollback remains governed by EPIC-REL-001.

Operations may initiate or execute rollback when runtime evidence indicates that the active release is unsafe or unusable.

The boundary is:

```text
Operational Evidence
        ↓
Rollback Decision
        ↓
Release Framework
        ↓
Previous Approved Artifact
        ↓
Operational Deployment
        ↓
Verification
```

---

## Backup Architecture

Persistent FamilyOS information may require backup.

The conceptual architecture is:

```text
Persistent State
      ↓
Backup Process
      ↓
Backup Artifact
      ↓
Integrity Validation
      ↓
Protected Storage
```

Backup architecture must follow applicable Security Framework requirements.

---

## Restore Architecture

Restore is distinct from backup creation.

```text
Backup Artifact
      ↓
Restore Procedure
      ↓
Recovered State
      ↓
Integrity Validation
      ↓
Functional Validation
```

A backup strategy without tested restoration provides weak recovery assurance.

---

## Operational Security Architecture

Operational actions may have significant privilege.

Examples include:

* service control;
* configuration changes;
* diagnostics access;
* backup access;
* restoration;
* secret rotation;
* plugin isolation;
* rollback.

These actions MUST remain subject to applicable EPIC-SEC-001 controls.

---

## Privileged Operational Action

A privileged operational action conceptually follows:

```text
Actor
   ↓
Authentication
   ↓
Authorization
   ↓
Operational Action
   ↓
Result
   ↓
Security + Operational Evidence
```

Operations MUST NOT create privileged bypass mechanisms around the Security Framework.

---

## Secret Integration

Runtime components should consume secrets through Security Framework contracts.

Conceptually:

```text
Runtime Component
       ↓
Secret Reference
       ↓
Secret Provider
       ↓
Protected Value
```

Secrets should not be embedded directly into operational evidence.

---

## Plugin Operations Architecture

Plugins participate in runtime operations through controlled boundaries.

Operationally relevant plugin properties may include:

```text
Plugin Identity

Plugin Version

Enabled State

Configuration

Dependencies

Health

Capabilities

Failure State
```

Plugins should not invent incompatible operational semantics unnecessarily.

---

## Plugin Startup

A plugin may require:

```text
Load
  ↓
Metadata Validation
  ↓
Configuration Validation
  ↓
Dependency Resolution
  ↓
Initialization
  ↓
Ready
```

Plugin failure should be isolated when the plugin is not critical to core runtime.

---

## Plugin Health

Plugin health should integrate with the common operational health model where practical.

For example:

```text
Plugin A   HEALTHY
Plugin B   DEGRADED
Plugin C   UNHEALTHY
```

Runtime aggregation determines the resulting platform state according to dependency criticality.

---

## Plugin Isolation

A malfunctioning plugin SHOULD be isolatable where architecture allows.

Conceptually:

```text
Plugin Failure
      ↓
Disable / Isolate Plugin
      ↓
Preserve Core Runtime
      ↓
Operational Evidence
```

Isolation must respect capability and dependency relationships.

---

## External Integration Architecture

External integrations are operationally unreliable by definition because FamilyOS does not control them.

The architecture should therefore assume:

```text
External Systems Can Fail
External Systems Can Slow Down
Credentials Can Expire
Responses Can Change
Networks Can Fail
```

Integration architecture should contain these failures.

---

## Integration Boundary

A conceptual external integration boundary is:

```text
FamilyOS
   ↓
Adapter
   ↓
Timeout / Retry / Validation
   ↓
Security Boundary
   ↓
External System
```

Adapters prevent external operational behavior from leaking unnecessarily into core architecture.

---

## Scheduler Architecture

Scheduled operations may become operational units when they perform meaningful work.

A scheduled operation should expose:

```text
schedule identity
last execution
execution result
duration
next execution
failure state
```

only where those properties provide operational value.

---

## Worker Architecture

Background workers SHOULD have explicit operational behavior.

Relevant concerns include:

* startup;
* shutdown;
* concurrency;
* queue bounds;
* failure handling;
* retry;
* observability.

Worker complexity should remain proportional to actual workload.

---

## Maintenance Operations

FamilyOS may require controlled maintenance operations.

Examples include:

* cleanup;
* migration;
* backup;
* integrity checks;
* index rebuilding;
* credential rotation.

Maintenance actions should be:

```text
Explicit
Authorized
Observable
Verifiable
```

---

## Automation Architecture

Operational automation should act through explicit contracts.

The preferred model is:

```text
Condition
   ↓
Evaluation
   ↓
Policy
   ↓
Action
   ↓
Verification
   ↓
Evidence
```

Automation must not bypass validation or security controls.

---

## Automation Levels

Operational automation may evolve through:

```text
Manual
   ↓
Scripted
   ↓
Automated
   ↓
Condition-Driven
```

FamilyOS should move upward only where the procedure is sufficiently stable.

---

## Automation Preconditions

Automated operations SHOULD define preconditions.

For example:

```text
Recovery Action
      ↓
Allowed only if
      ↓
Known Failure Condition
+
Authorized Context
+
Valid Recovery Target
```

This prevents automation from executing blindly.

---

## Automation Verification

Every meaningful automated operational action SHOULD verify its result.

```text
Action
   ↓
Expected State
   ↓
Observation
   ↓
Comparison
   ↓
PASS / FAIL
```

Execution success alone is insufficient.

---

## Human Approval Boundary

Certain actions may require human approval.

Examples may include:

```text
Destructive Restore

Production Data Modification

Critical Security Change

High-Risk Rollback

Irreversible Maintenance
```

The architecture must permit explicit human control.

---

## Operational Command Model

Operational actions SHOULD be represented as explicit commands or service operations rather than uncontrolled internal mutation.

Conceptually:

```text
Operational Request
        ↓
Validation
        ↓
Authorization
        ↓
Execution
        ↓
Result
        ↓
Evidence
```

---

## Operational Result

A conceptual operational result may contain:

```text
operation
target
status
started_at
completed_at
reason
evidence_reference
```

Implementation should remain minimal until richer result models become necessary.

---

## Operational Evidence Architecture

Operational evidence supports:

* diagnosis;
* incident response;
* recovery verification;
* auditing;
* quality improvement;
* security investigation;
* release evaluation.

Evidence should be structured where practical.

---

## Evidence Sources

Operational evidence may come from:

```text
Logs

Metrics

Traces

Health Checks

Security Events

Operational Events

Release Metadata

Configuration Metadata

Validation Results
```

Existing frameworks remain authoritative for their respective evidence types.

---

## Evidence Correlation

Evidence should be correlatable using stable identifiers where appropriate.

Examples include:

```text
release_id
runtime_id
component_id
operation_id
correlation_id
incident_id
```

Not every event requires every identifier.

---

## Evidence Retention

Operational evidence retention should reflect:

* diagnostic value;
* privacy;
* security;
* storage cost;
* compliance requirements.

Unlimited retention is not a default requirement.

---

## Control Plane Concept

As FamilyOS matures, operational management may be understood as a control plane.

Conceptually:

```text
              Control Plane
                    │
        ┌───────────┼───────────┐
        │           │           │
        ▼           ▼           ▼
 Configuration   Lifecycle   Recovery
        │           │           │
        └───────────┼───────────┘
                    ▼
               Runtime Plane
```

This is an architectural concept.

EPIC-OPS-001 does not require implementation of a separate control-plane service.

---

## Runtime Plane Concept

The runtime plane contains the components performing FamilyOS work.

Examples include:

```text
Core Services

Capabilities

Plugins

Repositories

Workers

Integrations
```

Operational controls act upon this plane through defined interfaces.

---

## Control and Observation Separation

Operational control and observation should remain conceptually distinct.

```text
Observation
    ↓
Understand State
```

versus:

```text
Control
   ↓
Change State
```

Combining both without clear boundaries can create unsafe operational behavior.

---

## Operational Repository Interfaces

If persistent operational state becomes necessary, repository abstractions SHOULD follow existing FamilyOS architectural conventions.

Potential state may include:

* incidents;
* operational history;
* recovery records;
* maintenance execution.

Persistent operational storage should only be introduced when required.

---

## In-Memory Implementations

Initial implementations MAY use in-memory operational repositories for:

* unit testing;
* local development;
* deterministic validation.

This aligns with existing FamilyOS development practices.

---

## Architecture Layers

The Operations architecture should preserve FamilyOS layering.

A conceptual structure is:

```text
Domain
  ↓
Application
  ↓
Ports
  ↓
Adapters
  ↓
Infrastructure
```

Operational domain concepts should not depend directly on infrastructure providers.

---

## Domain Layer

Potential operational domain concepts include:

```text
OperationalState

HealthStatus

DependencyStatus

Incident

IncidentSeverity

RecoveryAction

OperationalResult
```

Only concepts required by implementation should become concrete domain models.

---

## Application Layer

Application services may coordinate operations such as:

```text
EvaluateHealth

StartRuntime

StopRuntime

AssessIncident

ExecuteRecovery

VerifyRecovery
```

Services should orchestrate rather than embed infrastructure-specific behavior.

---

## Ports

Ports define infrastructure-independent operational contracts.

Potential ports include:

```text
HealthProbe

RuntimeController

ConfigurationProvider

RecoveryExecutor

OperationalEventSink
```

Not all ports need immediate implementation.

---

## Adapters

Adapters may integrate with:

* operating systems;
* process managers;
* container runtimes;
* secret providers;
* monitoring platforms;
* backup systems;
* external services.

Core operational logic should not depend directly on these technologies.

---

## Infrastructure Independence

FamilyOS MUST NOT require a specific infrastructure platform merely to satisfy the Operations Framework.

The architecture should remain usable for:

```text
Local Execution

Single Host

Containers

Future Distributed Deployment
```

Infrastructure evolution should not require rewriting operational domain concepts.

---

## Vendor Neutrality

Operational contracts should remain vendor-neutral.

The architecture is:

```text
FamilyOS Operations
        ↓
Operational Port
        ↓
Adapter
        ↓
Infrastructure Provider
```

This protects FamilyOS from unnecessary provider coupling.

---

## Local Development Architecture

Local operation should remain simple.

Developers should be able to:

```text
Configure
   ↓
Start
   ↓
Inspect Health
   ↓
Exercise Capabilities
   ↓
Stop
```

without requiring production-grade infrastructure.

---

## Test Architecture

Operational components should support deterministic testing.

Testing may use:

* fake clocks;
* in-memory repositories;
* synthetic health probes;
* fake dependencies;
* deterministic failures;
* fake runtime controllers.

This allows operational behavior to be tested without real infrastructure.

---

## Failure Injection

Testing MAY introduce controlled failure conditions.

Examples include:

```text
Dependency Timeout

Repository Failure

Invalid Configuration

Plugin Startup Failure

Resource Constraint
```

Failure injection should remain deterministic and test-focused.

---

## Validation Architecture

Operational validation occurs at multiple levels.

```text
Static Validation
       ↓
Configuration Validation
       ↓
Unit Testing
       ↓
Integration Testing
       ↓
Startup Validation
       ↓
Runtime Validation
       ↓
Recovery Validation
```

Not every release requires every possible operational test.

---

## Release Integration

Operational requirements may contribute to release decisions.

A release may be blocked when:

* critical startup validation fails;
* required operational configuration is invalid;
* critical health behavior is broken;
* recovery mechanisms are known to be unusable;
* security-critical operational controls fail.

Release governance remains owned by EPIC-REL-001.

---

## Deployment Verification

After deployment or activation, FamilyOS SHOULD verify the runtime.

A conceptual verification sequence is:

```text
Deploy
   ↓
Runtime Starts
   ↓
Readiness Check
   ↓
Health Check
   ↓
Critical Functional Check
   ↓
Deployment Verified
```

Deployment success should not be defined only as successful artifact transfer.

---

## Operational Change Verification

Any significant operational change should follow:

```text
Change
   ↓
Observe
   ↓
Validate
   ↓
Confirm
```

This applies to:

* configuration;
* deployment;
* recovery;
* plugin activation;
* dependency changes.

---

## Architecture for Learning

Operations provides feedback to engineering.

The feedback loop is:

```text
Runtime
   ↓
Incident / Degradation / Performance Evidence
   ↓
Analysis
   ↓
Engineering Change
   ↓
Testing
   ↓
Release
   ↓
Runtime
```

Operational architecture therefore supports continuous improvement.

---

## Post-Incident Improvement

Significant incidents may generate:

* defects;
* tests;
* observability improvements;
* security controls;
* runbooks;
* architecture changes;
* automation.

Incident review should focus on system improvement rather than documentation volume.

---

## Architecture Decision Rule

New operational infrastructure SHOULD only be introduced when:

```text
Concrete Operational Problem
          +
Existing Mechanisms Insufficient
          +
Expected Benefit
          >
Added Complexity
```

This rule protects FamilyOS from operational overengineering.

---

## Minimal Operations Architecture

The minimum useful FamilyOS operations architecture is:

```text
Released Artifact
      ↓
Validated Configuration
      ↓
Controlled Startup
      ↓
Runtime
      ↓
Health
      ↓
Observability
      ↓
Controlled Recovery
      ↓
Verification
```

This is the initial implementation target.

---

## Initial Core Contracts

The first implementation SHOULD prioritize only contracts that enable meaningful operational behavior.

Potential primitives include:

```text
OperationalState

HealthStatus

HealthResult

DependencyStatus

OperationalAction

OperationalResult
```

Additional abstractions should be added only when implementation demonstrates a concrete need.

---

## Initial Runtime Services

Potential initial application services include:

```text
HealthService

RuntimeValidationService

RecoveryService
```

The final service boundaries should follow implementation needs rather than documentation alone.

---

## Initial Adapters

Initial adapters may remain extremely simple.

Examples include:

```text
LocalRuntimeAdapter

InMemoryHealthProbe

EnvironmentConfigurationAdapter
```

Infrastructure adapters should evolve with actual deployment architecture.

---

## Architecture Evolution

The Operations Architecture may eventually support:

```text
Single Runtime
      ↓
Multiple Operational Units
      ↓
Automated Recovery
      ↓
Distributed Runtime
      ↓
Advanced Operational Control
```

No later stage is required until FamilyOS reaches the corresponding operational complexity.

---

## Architecture Constraints

The following constraints are normative for EPIC-OPS-001:

* operations MUST reuse the Observability Framework for telemetry;
* privileged operational actions MUST follow Security Framework controls;
* runtime artifacts SHOULD remain traceable to releases;
* critical configuration MUST be validated;
* health semantics SHOULD be explicit;
* dependency criticality SHOULD be explicit where operationally relevant;
* recovery SHOULD be verifiable;
* automation SHOULD expose evidence;
* operational infrastructure SHOULD remain vendor-neutral where practical;
* unnecessary distributed-system complexity MUST be avoided.

---

## Architecture Invariants

The following invariants define expected operational behavior.

### Invariant 1 — Released Artifact Identity

A meaningful runtime should be traceable to its released software version.

### Invariant 2 — Validated Runtime Configuration

Critical runtime configuration must be validated before unsafe execution.

### Invariant 3 — Explicit Health

Operationally significant units must provide sufficient state to determine whether they can perform their responsibilities.

### Invariant 4 — Failure Visibility

Significant operational failure must produce observable evidence.

### Invariant 5 — Controlled Privilege

Privileged operational actions must remain subject to applicable security controls.

### Invariant 6 — Recovery Verification

A recovery action is not considered successful until the resulting operational state is verified.

### Invariant 7 — Framework Reuse

Operations must not duplicate capabilities already owned by Release, Observability, Security, Testing, or Quality frameworks.

### Invariant 8 — Proportional Complexity

Operational infrastructure must remain proportional to actual FamilyOS requirements.

---

## Architectural Anti-Patterns

The following patterns should be avoided.

### Infrastructure-First Operations

Choosing complex infrastructure before operational requirements are understood.

### Hidden Runtime State

Important runtime state exists but cannot be inspected.

### Implicit Dependencies

Components fail because operational dependencies were never defined.

### Infinite Retry

Failures trigger unlimited retry loops.

### Restart-Only Recovery

Every failure is treated as requiring restart regardless of cause.

### Telemetry Duplication

Operations creates a second logging, metrics, or tracing architecture.

### Security Bypass

Operational tooling bypasses authorization because it is considered administrative.

### Unverified Automation

Automation performs actions without confirming resulting state.

### Vendor-Coupled Domain Logic

Operational domain behavior depends directly on a specific infrastructure provider.

                        ↓
                     Runtime
```

```

for implementation and automation;

and:

```text
09-Validation-and-Release.md
```

for framework validation and release integration.

---

## Success Criteria

The Operations Architecture is successful when FamilyOS can establish:

```text
Runtime Identity
      +
Validated Configuration
      +
Explicit Lifecycle
      +
Health
      +
Dependency Awareness
      +
Failure Isolation
      +
Observability
      +
Controlled Actions
      +
Recovery
      +
Verification
      =
Operable FamilyOS
```

---

## Expected Outcome

After implementation of this architecture, FamilyOS should be capable of moving from:

```text
Software That Runs
```

to:

```text
Software That Can Be Operated
```

The distinction is fundamental.

An operable FamilyOS runtime can be understood, controlled, diagnosed, recovered, validated, and improved without relying on undocumented knowledge or uncontrolled intervention.

---

## Conclusion

EPIC-OPS-001 defines an Operations Architecture centered on explicit runtime state, controlled lifecycle transitions, observable health, dependency awareness, failure isolation, secure operational control, predictable recovery, and verifiable outcomes.

The architecture deliberately avoids premature infrastructure complexity.

Its role is to provide stable operational contracts that work for the current FamilyOS architecture while remaining extensible toward more advanced runtime environments when concrete requirements emerge.

The governing architectural principle is:

> FamilyOS operations must make runtime state explicit, failure understandable, operational action controlled, and recovery verifiable.
