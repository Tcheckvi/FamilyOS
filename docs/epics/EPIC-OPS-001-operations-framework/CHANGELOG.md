## 5.1.0 — Operations Framework

### Historical Status

```text
PUBLISHED
```

Historical release tag:

```text
v5.1.0-operations-framework
```

Historical publication commit:

```text
1e4104000f719a030b1ae72839708e0a877960d1

---

## Historical Documentation Model

The original Operations Framework release used the compact FamilyOS framework documentation model.

Historical structure:

```text
Canonical Range:       00 → 09
Numbered Documents:    10
Control Documents:      0
Historical Files:      10
```

The seven standardized control documents used by the current FamilyOS framework-governance model were not part of the original publication.

This historical distinction SHALL remain preserved.

---

## Added in 5.1.0

### Operations Framework Foundation

Established **EPIC-OPS-001 — Operations Framework** as the canonical FamilyOS operational engineering foundation.

The framework introduced a dedicated operations model covering:

* operations principles;
* operations architecture;
* runtime management;
* service management;
* configuration;
* dependencies;
* incident response;
* recovery;
* rollback;
* capacity;
* performance;
* reliability;
* operational security;
* governance;
* implementation;
* automation;
* validation;
* release integration.

---

## Canonical Historical Documents

The historical release established the following numbered-document structure:

```text
00-EPIC.md
01-Context-and-Vision.md
02-Operations-Principles.md
03-Operations-Architecture.md
04-Runtime-and-Service-Management.md
05-Incident-Response-and-Recovery.md
06-Capacity-Performance-and-Reliability.md
07-Operational-Security-and-Governance.md
08-Implementation-and-Automation.md
09-Validation-and-Release.md
```

Historical numbered-document count:

```text
10
```

---

## Operations Principles

Version `5.1.0` established foundational operational principles including:

```text
Explicit Ownership
Controlled Change
Validated Runtime Configuration
Observable Operation
Recoverability
Evidence-Based Operation
Automation with Validation
Security by Default
Infrastructure Neutrality
Proportional Complexity
Repeatability
Deterministic Validation
```

These principles govern operational design, implementation, automation, and runtime behavior.

---

## Explicit Ownership

Operational responsibilities SHOULD have identifiable ownership.

Ownership may apply to:

* services;
* environments;
* incidents;
* recovery procedures;
* alerts;
* maintenance;
* automation;
* privileged operational actions.

Ambiguous ownership increases operational risk.

---

## Controlled Change

The framework established controlled change as a core requirement.

Operational changes may include:

* configuration changes;
* deployment changes;
* environment changes;
* infrastructure changes;
* credential rotation;
* maintenance;
* recovery actions.

High-impact changes SHOULD receive proportionally stronger validation.

---

## Validated Runtime Configuration

Version `5.1.0` established validation of critical runtime configuration before unsafe execution.

Configuration validation may include:

* schema;
* required fields;
* environment constraints;
* dependency configuration;
* security constraints;
* compatibility.

Invalid critical configuration SHOULD fail safely.

---

## Observable Operation

Operational behavior SHOULD remain observable.

Useful evidence may include:

* logs;
* metrics;
* traces;
* runtime state;
* health information;
* readiness state;
* automation results;
* incident records;
* recovery evidence.

EPIC-OBS-001 remains authoritative for observability architecture.

---

## Recoverability

The framework established recoverability as a permanent operational requirement.

Recovery may involve:

* restart;
* retry;
* rollback;
* restore;
* failover;
* configuration correction;
* manual intervention.

Recovery SHALL include validation.

---

## Evidence-Based Operation

Operational success SHALL not be inferred merely because a command completed.

Preferred model:

```text
Action
    ↓
Observed Result
    ↓
Validation
    ↓
Evidence
    ↓
Decision
```

This principle applies especially to:

* deployment;
* recovery;
* rollback;
* provisioning;
* credential rotation;
* configuration changes.

---

## Automation with Validation

Version `5.1.0` established operational automation as a controlled capability.

Automation SHOULD:

* validate inputs;
* identify the target;
* verify authority;
* execute deterministically where practical;
* expose failure;
* validate results;
* preserve evidence.

Automation SHALL NOT bypass security or validation.

---

## Security by Default

Operational convenience SHALL NOT weaken FamilyOS security controls.

Protected operational actions SHOULD require appropriate authorization.

Operational tooling SHALL NOT intentionally expose:

* passwords;
* tokens;
* private keys;
* credentials;
* sensitive configuration.

---

## Infrastructure Neutrality

The Operations Framework remains independent of specific infrastructure products.

It does not require a particular:

* cloud provider;
* container platform;
* orchestrator;
* deployment service;
* operating system;
* infrastructure-as-code product.

Infrastructure choices may evolve while operational contracts remain stable.

---

## Proportional Complexity

Operational sophistication SHOULD follow demonstrated need.

The preferred progression is:

```text
Observed Need
    ↓
Evidence
    ↓
Operational Requirement
    ↓
Appropriate Mechanism
    ↓
Validation
```

The framework explicitly avoids infrastructure complexity introduced purely for hypothetical future requirements.

---

## Operations Architecture

Version `5.1.0` established the canonical Operations Architecture.

A conceptual structure is:

```text
+--------------------------------------------------+
|                Operations Governance             |
+--------------------------------------------------+
| Security | Authorization | Validation | Evidence |
+--------------------------------------------------+
| Incidents | Recovery | Reliability | Capacity    |
+--------------------------------------------------+
| Runtime Management | Service Management          |
+--------------------------------------------------+
| Configuration | Dependencies | Health | Readiness|
+--------------------------------------------------+
|               Runtime Environment                |
+--------------------------------------------------+
```

The architecture separates operational-domain concepts from infrastructure providers.

---

## Runtime Management

The framework introduced explicit runtime lifecycle management.

Potential runtime states include:

```text
DEFINED
CONFIGURED
VALIDATED
STARTING
READY
RUNNING
DEGRADED
FAILED
RECOVERING
STOPPING
STOPPED
```

Not every implementation requires every state.

Operational meaning SHOULD remain explicit.

---

## Service Management

Version `5.1.0` established service lifecycle expectations including:

* startup;
* initialization;
* configuration;
* dependency validation;
* health;
* readiness;
* normal operation;
* maintenance;
* degradation;
* failure;
* recovery;
* shutdown.

A service SHALL NOT be considered healthy merely because a process exists.

---

## Configuration Management

Operational configuration SHOULD be:

* explicit;
* validated;
* secure;
* reviewable;
* environment-aware;
* reproducible where practical;
* traceable when required.

Configuration drift SHOULD be minimized.

---

## Health

The framework established explicit operational health semantics.

Potential states may include:

```text
HEALTHY
DEGRADED
UNHEALTHY
UNKNOWN
```

Health SHOULD communicate meaningful operational condition.

---

## Readiness

Readiness was established as distinct from process existence and health.

A component may be running but not ready because:

* initialization is incomplete;
* required dependencies are unavailable;
* configuration is invalid;
* migrations remain incomplete;
* required secrets are unavailable.

---

## Dependency Management

Runtime dependencies SHALL remain explicit.

Operational dependency handling may consider:

* identity;
* availability;
* compatibility;
* authorization;
* timeout;
* retry;
* degradation;
* failure;
* recovery.

Dependency failure SHOULD not automatically produce uncontrolled failure propagation.

---

## Incident Response

Version `5.1.0` established structured incident response.

Canonical conceptual flow:

```text
Detection
    ↓
Assessment
    ↓
Classification
    ↓
Containment
    ↓
Recovery
    ↓
Validation
    ↓
Closure
    ↓
Learning
```

Significant incidents SHOULD produce structured learning.

---

## Incident Classification

Incident severity may consider:

* user impact;
* service impact;
* data impact;
* security impact;
* operational scope;
* duration;
* recoverability.

Severity SHOULD guide escalation and response rigor.

---

## Incident Evidence

Incident handling SHOULD preserve evidence appropriate to impact.

Evidence may support:

* diagnosis;
* recovery;
* security investigation;
* post-incident analysis;
* future prevention.

Evidence SHALL remain security- and privacy-aware.

---

## Recovery

The framework established a strong distinction between restart, restoration, and recovery.

```text
Restarted != Recovered
Restored  != Validated
Recovered = Restored + Validated
```

Recovery validation may include:

* runtime integrity;
* service availability;
* dependencies;
* health;
* readiness;
* configuration;
* data integrity;
* security controls.

---

## Rollback

Rollback was defined as a controlled recovery action.

Rollback SHOULD consider:

* application version;
* configuration compatibility;
* data compatibility;
* migration state;
* dependency compatibility;
* security state.

Rollback completion SHALL NOT automatically establish successful recovery.

---

## Capacity

Version `5.1.0` established evidence-based capacity management.

Capacity considerations may include:

* compute;
* memory;
* storage;
* network;
* workload;
* concurrency;
* throughput;
* dependency limits;
* safety margins.

---

## Capacity Review

Capacity SHOULD be reviewed against actual operational evidence.

The framework avoids mandatory large-scale infrastructure before measured requirements justify it.

---

## Performance

The framework established measurable operational performance.

Relevant indicators may include:

* latency;
* throughput;
* queue depth;
* resource utilization;
* startup duration;
* recovery duration;
* dependency response time.

Performance validation SHOULD identify the relevant build or artifact where practical.

---

## Reliability

Reliability engineering may include:

* timeouts;
* retries;
* dependency isolation;
* controlled degradation;
* recovery;
* rollback;
* capacity margins;
* operational validation.

Reliability SHALL remain compatible with correctness and security.

---

## Operational Security

Version `5.1.0` integrated security into operations.

Operational security may include:

* authorization;
* protected state changes;
* secret protection;
* privileged-action controls;
* secure configuration;
* credential rotation;
* restore integrity;
* security validation.

EPIC-SEC-001 remains authoritative for Security Framework policy.

---

## Operational Governance

The framework established governance for operational actions.

Governance may cover:

* ownership;
* authorization;
* maintenance;
* change control;
* privileged operation;
* emergency action;
* incident escalation;
* recovery approval;
* evidence.

Governance SHOULD remain proportional to operational impact.

---

## Implementation Direction

Version `5.1.0` provided implementation direction without binding FamilyOS to one infrastructure platform.

Implementation areas may include:

* runtime control services;
* health mechanisms;
* dependency validation;
* configuration validation;
* automation;
* provisioning;
* recovery tooling;
* operational evidence.

---

## Infrastructure as Code

The framework encouraged declarative infrastructure representation where practical.

Infrastructure as Code may improve:

* reproducibility;
* version control;
* reviewability;
* recovery;
* drift detection;
* validation.

No specific IaC technology is mandated.

---

## Automation

Operations automation may include:

* provisioning;
* configuration;
* deployment;
* runtime management;
* health checks;
* backup;
* restore;
* rollback;
* maintenance;
* credential rotation;
* validation.

---

## Canonical Automation Flow

Version `5.1.0` establishes the conceptual automation sequence:

```text
Input
    ↓
Validation
    ↓
Authorization
    ↓
Execution
    ↓
Observation
    ↓
Post-Execution Validation
    ↓
Evidence
```

The result of execution SHALL be verified.

---

## Structured Automation Results

Automation SHOULD produce structured output where practical.

Potential fields include:

```text
status
action
target
started_at
completed_at
duration
validation_result
failure_type
correlation_id
```

Human-readable output may coexist with structured output.

---

## Operational Validation

Operational validation may occur at several levels:

```text
Static Validation
Configuration Validation
Provisioning Validation
Startup Validation
Dependency Validation
Health Validation
Readiness Validation
Runtime Validation
Security Validation
Recovery Validation
Rollback Validation
Functional Validation
```

Validation SHALL provide evidence appropriate to the decision it supports.

---

## Testing Integration

EPIC-OPS-001 integrates with the FamilyOS Testing Framework.

Operations-specific tests may validate:

* runtime states;
* invalid configuration;
* dependency failures;
* health;
* readiness;
* recovery;
* rollback;
* automation;
* incident workflows.

EPIC-TST-001 remains authoritative for general testing architecture.

---

## Quality Integration

The framework integrates with EPIC-QLT-001.

Operational evidence may contribute to quality evaluation through:

* reliability;
* runtime stability;
* performance;
* recoverability;
* operational correctness.

---

## Build Integration

EPIC-OPS-001 consumes artifacts produced by EPIC-BLD-001.

Operational mechanisms SHOULD deploy validated artifacts without uncontrolled changes that would invalidate artifact integrity or provenance.

---

## Release Integration

Operations integrates with EPIC-REL-001.

Operational responsibilities may include:

* deployment;
* startup;
* readiness verification;
* runtime validation;
* rollback;
* recovery.

EPIC-REL-001 remains authoritative for release lifecycle semantics.

---

## Observability Integration

EPIC-OBS-001 remains authoritative for observability.

Operations consumes signals including:

* logs;
* metrics;
* traces;
* health;
* diagnostics;
* correlation.

Operational behavior SHOULD remain diagnosable.

---

## Security Integration

EPIC-SEC-001 remains authoritative for security architecture and policy.

Operations consumes security mechanisms for:

* identity;
* authentication;
* authorization;
* secrets;
* privileged actions;
* security validation.

---

## Framework Boundaries

EPIC-OPS-001 owns:

* operational principles;
* operations architecture;
* runtime management;
* service management;
* incident response;
* recovery;
* capacity;
* performance;
* reliability;
* operational security execution;
* operational governance;
* automation;
* operational validation.

It does not own:

* general testing architecture;
* quality governance;
* build lifecycle;
* release lifecycle;
* observability architecture;
* security policy architecture.

---

## Historical Validation State

The historical numbered framework may contain pre-publication state markers such as:

```text
PENDING
Ready for Final Validation
Implementation Status: Pending
```

These represent historical workflow or example states.

They SHALL NOT automatically be interpreted as current control-layer lifecycle state.

---

## Historical Release Completion

Version `5.1.0` was completed and published under:

```text
v5.1.0-operations-framework
```

The historical tag resolves to:

```text
1e4104000f719a030b1ae72839708e0a877960d1
```

The historical framework publication is therefore complete.

---

## Historical Tag Integrity

The following operations are prohibited during current normalization:

```text
Move historical tag
Delete and recreate historical tag
Force-update historical tag
Point historical tag at normalization commit
Rewrite historical publication commit
```

Normalization belongs to later forward repository history.

---

## Post-Release Governance Evolution

After historical publication, the FamilyOS framework-governance model evolved.

EPIC-OPS-001 therefore receives the standardized control-document layer:

```text
EPIC-OPS-001.md
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

---

## Historical vs Current Repository State

Historical publication:

```text
Canonical Range:       00 → 09
Numbered Documents:    10
Control Documents:      0
Historical Files:      10
```

Current normalized repository:

```text
Canonical Range:       00 → 09
Numbered Documents:    10
Control Documents:      7
Canonical Files:       17
```

The current structure SHALL NOT be retroactively attributed to the historical release.

---

## Current Revalidation

The normalized repository representation requires evidence-based revalidation.

Required checks include:

```text
YAML Parse
YAML Contract
Filesystem Contract
Canonical Inventory
Numbering Integrity
Control Documents
Empty File Check
Manifest Synchronization
README Synchronization
EPIC Summary Synchronization
Changelog Synchronization
Revision History Synchronization
State Consistency

Pytest
Diff Check
Final Repository State
```

---

## Validation Evidence Policy

The required model is:

```text
Execute
    ↓
Observe
    ↓
Evaluate
    ↓
Record
```

The prohibited model is:

```text
Requirement Documented
    ↓
Assume Success
    ↓
Record PASS
```

Current repository validation SHALL be based on actual evidence.

---

## Current Normalization State

```text

Final Revalidation:      Validated
```

---

## Future Changes

Future Operations Framework revisions may introduce:

* machine-readable operational policies;
* formal runtime-state schemas;
* health contracts;
* readiness contracts;
* incident-severity models;
* recovery profiles;
* reliability targets;
* service-level objectives;
* capacity models;
* automated operational-policy validation;
* richer infrastructure adapters;
* operational governance automation.

Such changes SHALL follow FamilyOS framework versioning and release governance rather than modifying historical version `5.1.0` in place.

---

## Final Changelog Principle

The canonical historical statement for EPIC-OPS-001 is:

```text
Version:                 5.1.0
Historical Publication:  Published
Historical Tag:          v5.1.0-operations-framework
Historical Commit:       1e4104000f719a030b1ae72839708e0a877960d1
Historical Tag Policy:   Immutable
```

The current control-document normalization is a post-release repository-governance change.

It preserves the original release identity while bringing EPIC-OPS-001 into alignment with the current FamilyOS framework-control model.
