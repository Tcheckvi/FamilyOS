# Operations Framework

## 02 Operations Principles

### Overview

The FamilyOS Operations Framework is governed by a set of operational principles that define how the platform, services, plugins, infrastructure, environments, and supporting processes are operated throughout their lifecycle.

These principles establish the behavioral and architectural expectations required to maintain FamilyOS as a reliable, secure, observable, recoverable, and sustainable platform.

Operations is not considered a separate activity that begins after software development is complete.

Operational concerns MUST be incorporated into architecture, implementation, testing, build, release, deployment, runtime management, incident response, recovery, and continuous improvement.

The principles defined in this document provide the normative foundation for all subsequent EPIC-OPS-001 operational requirements.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of the Operations Principles is to establish consistent rules for:

* operational ownership;
* operational readiness;
* automation;
* repeatability;
* reliability;
* availability;
* observability;
* configuration;
* change management;
* deployment;
* incident response;
* recovery;
* capacity;
* security;
* evidence;
* continuous improvement.

These principles SHOULD guide both technical architecture and operational decision-making across FamilyOS.

---

## Core Operations Principle

The primary FamilyOS operations principle is:

> Every FamilyOS capability intended for real use must be designed not only to function correctly, but also to be operated, observed, maintained, recovered, and evolved safely.

Operational readiness is therefore part of engineering completeness.

A feature that works but cannot be operated reliably is incomplete.

---

## Operations as an Engineering Discipline

FamilyOS treats operations as an engineering discipline.

Operations MUST be:

* designed;
* documented;
* automated where practical;
* tested;
* observable;
* measurable;
* governed;
* continuously improved.

Operational behavior MUST NOT depend exclusively on undocumented human knowledge.

---

## Principle 1 — Operational Responsibility Is Explicit

Every operationally significant FamilyOS component SHOULD have defined responsibility.

Ownership MAY apply to:

* services;
* plugins;
* environments;
* infrastructure;
* deployment workflows;
* operational procedures;
* data stores;
* integrations.

Ownership SHOULD identify who is responsible for:

* operational health;
* maintenance;
* incidents;
* recovery;
* changes;
* documentation.

Unowned operational components create unmanaged risk.

---

## Service Ownership

Operational ownership SHOULD remain identifiable throughout the service lifecycle.

A service owner SHOULD understand:

```text
Service
   │
   ├── Purpose
   ├── Dependencies
   ├── Operational Requirements
   ├── Observability
   ├── Failure Modes
   ├── Recovery
   └── Lifecycle
```

Ownership MAY be organizational or architectural depending on the FamilyOS operating model.

---

## Shared Responsibility

Ownership does not imply that one individual performs every operational task.

FamilyOS SHOULD use shared responsibility where appropriate.

For example:

```text
Development
     +
Security
     +
Operations
     +
Release Governance
     │
     ▼
Operational Responsibility
```

Responsibilities MUST remain sufficiently clear to avoid gaps.

---

## Principle 2 — Operational Readiness Begins During Design

Operational readiness MUST NOT begin only when deployment is imminent.

Architecture and implementation SHOULD consider:

* deployment;
* configuration;
* monitoring;
* logging;
* metrics;
* failure handling;
* backup;
* recovery;
* maintenance;
* upgrades;
* rollback.

Operational concerns SHOULD influence design decisions from the beginning.

---

## Design for Operations

Components SHOULD be designed so that operators can determine:

* whether the component is running;
* whether it is healthy;
* what version is running;
* what configuration is active;
* which dependencies are required;
* why failures occur;
* how recovery is performed.

Systems that cannot answer these questions create operational uncertainty.

---

## Principle 3 — Automation Is Preferred Over Repeated Manual Work

Repeatable operational activities SHOULD be automated where reliable automation is practical.

Automation MAY apply to:

* deployment;
* configuration validation;
* health checks;
* backups;
* restoration verification;
* monitoring;
* release validation;
* environment provisioning;
* operational reporting.

Manual procedures SHOULD remain available where automation cannot safely handle exceptional conditions.

---

## Automation Objectives

Operational automation SHOULD improve:

* consistency;
* repeatability;
* speed;
* traceability;
* reliability;
* recoverability.

Automation MUST NOT merely make unsafe processes execute faster.

---

## Safe Automation

Operational automation MUST include appropriate safeguards.

Automation SHOULD support:

* validation;
* controlled failure;
* clear output;
* rollback where appropriate;
* auditability;
* least privilege.

Automated operations MUST NOT silently ignore critical failures.

---

## Principle 4 — Operations Must Be Repeatable

The same operational procedure SHOULD produce predictable results when executed under equivalent conditions.

Repeatability applies to:

* environment creation;
* deployment;
* configuration;
* backup;
* restoration;
* maintenance;
* validation.

Repeatability reduces dependence on individual operator behavior.

---

## Reproducible Operational State

Where practical, FamilyOS SHOULD be capable of reconstructing operational state from controlled sources.

```text
Versioned Source
      +
Configuration
      +
Dependencies
      +
Operational Definitions
      │
      ▼
Reproducible Environment
```

Unrecorded manual changes SHOULD be minimized.

---

## Principle 5 — Desired State Must Be Explicit

Operational systems SHOULD have an identifiable desired state.

Desired state MAY include:

* deployed version;
* active configuration;
* required services;
* expected dependencies;
* security settings;
* resource allocation.

Actual state SHOULD be comparable with desired state.

---

## State Comparison

A mature operational model supports:

```text
Desired State
      │
      ▼
State Comparison
      ▲
      │
Actual State
```

Unexpected differences represent operational drift.

---

## Principle 6 — Configuration Is Controlled Operational State

Configuration materially affects runtime behavior and MUST therefore be governed.

Configuration SHOULD be:

* explicit;
* validated;
* versioned where appropriate;
* environment-aware;
* protected according to sensitivity;
* auditable.

Configuration MUST NOT be confused with secrets.

---

## Configuration Separation

FamilyOS SHOULD separate:

```text
Application Code
Configuration
Secrets
Runtime State
```

These categories have different lifecycle and security requirements.

Mixing them unnecessarily increases operational risk.

---

## Principle 7 — Environments Must Be Predictable

Operational environments SHOULD have clearly defined purposes.

Examples include:

```text
Development
Testing
Staging
Production
```

Environment differences SHOULD be intentional and documented.

Unexpected environmental differences create deployment and reliability risks.

---

## Environment Parity

FamilyOS SHOULD maintain sufficient environment parity to make pre-production validation meaningful.

Perfect identity between environments is not always necessary.

However, important differences SHOULD be understood.

These MAY include:

* scale;
* credentials;
* external integrations;
* data;
* network exposure;
* security policy.

---

## Environment Isolation

Environments SHOULD remain appropriately isolated.

Production SHOULD NOT depend on development resources without explicit architectural justification.

Production credentials MUST NOT be reused casually in lower-trust environments.

---

## Principle 8 — Changes Must Be Controlled

Operational changes MUST be deliberate.

Changes MAY include:

* deployments;
* configuration updates;
* infrastructure modifications;
* dependency upgrades;
* permission changes;
* migrations;
* maintenance operations.

Important changes SHOULD have sufficient traceability.

---

## Change Lifecycle

Operational changes SHOULD follow a controlled lifecycle.

```text
Change Proposal
      │
      ▼
Impact Assessment
      │
      ▼
Validation
      │
      ▼
Execution
      │
      ▼
Verification
      │
      ▼
Observation
```

High-risk changes MAY require additional approval.

---

## Principle 9 — Small Changes Are Preferred

Smaller operational changes are generally easier to:

* understand;
* validate;
* deploy;
* observe;
* troubleshoot;
* rollback.

FamilyOS SHOULD prefer incremental operational change where practical.

Large changes SHOULD receive proportionally stronger validation.

---

## Principle 10 — Deployment Must Be Predictable

Deployment MUST be treated as a controlled operational transition.

```text
Known State
    │
    ▼
Validated Change
    │
    ▼
Deployment
    │
    ▼
Verification
    │
    ▼
New Known State
```

Deployment MUST NOT be considered successful solely because the deployment command completed.

---

## Deployment Verification

Deployment SHOULD verify:

* intended version;
* expected configuration;
* service health;
* critical dependencies;
* security state;
* required migrations;
* operational telemetry.

Verification SHOULD occur before the deployment is considered complete.

---

## Principle 11 — Rollback Must Be Considered Before Deployment

Operational changes SHOULD define failure and rollback considerations before execution.

Rollback MAY involve:

* application version;
* configuration;
* infrastructure;
* database state;
* feature activation.

Not every change is fully reversible.

Irreversible changes MUST be identified explicitly.

---

## Rollback Safety

Rollback MUST NOT restore an unsafe or compromised state.

Security incidents MAY require:

```text
Application Rollback
        +
Credential Rotation
        +
Configuration Repair
        +
State Validation
```

Rollback is an operational recovery mechanism, not a substitute for incident response.

---

## Principle 12 — Observability Is an Operational Requirement

A component that cannot be observed cannot be operated reliably.

Operationally significant components SHOULD expose sufficient telemetry to understand:

* health;
* behavior;
* failures;
* dependencies;
* performance;
* resource usage.

FamilyOS operational observability MUST integrate with the FamilyOS Observability Framework.

---

## Operational Signals

Operational signals MAY include:

```text
Logs
Metrics
Traces
Events
Health Checks
Audit Evidence
```

The appropriate signals depend on component risk and complexity.

---

## Principle 13 — Health Must Be Explicit

Operational components SHOULD expose meaningful health information.

Health SHOULD distinguish where appropriate between:

* process existence;
* readiness;
* dependency availability;
* degraded operation;
* failure.

A running process MUST NOT automatically be considered a healthy service.

---

## Health Model

A simple operational health model MAY include:

```text
STARTING
HEALTHY
DEGRADED
UNHEALTHY
STOPPING
STOPPED
```

Health semantics SHOULD be defined consistently.

---

## Principle 14 — Failures Are Expected

FamilyOS MUST assume that operational failures will occur.

Potential failures include:

* software defects;
* dependency failures;
* network failures;
* storage failures;
* resource exhaustion;
* configuration errors;
* deployment failures;
* human mistakes;
* security incidents.

Architecture SHOULD minimize the impact of predictable failure modes.

---

## Failure-Oriented Design

Operational design SHOULD ask:

```text
What can fail?
      │
      ▼
How is failure detected?
      │
      ▼
What is the impact?
      │
      ▼
How is it contained?
      │
      ▼
How is service restored?
```

Failure planning MUST be part of operational architecture.

---

## Principle 15 — Failures Must Be Contained

Failure of one component SHOULD NOT unnecessarily propagate across the entire FamilyOS ecosystem.

Containment mechanisms MAY include:

* isolation;
* timeouts;
* retries;
* circuit breaking;
* resource limits;
* queue boundaries;
* graceful degradation.

Containment strategies MUST avoid creating secondary failures.

---

## Principle 16 — Graceful Degradation Is Preferred

Where appropriate, FamilyOS SHOULD continue providing safe reduced functionality when non-critical dependencies fail.

For example:

```text
Dependency Failure
       │
       ▼
Degraded Mode
       │
       ▼
Core Capability Preserved
```

Degradation MUST NOT bypass security or data-integrity requirements.

---

## Principle 17 — Recovery Must Be Designed and Tested

Recovery is not complete merely because a backup exists.

Recovery procedures SHOULD be:

* documented;
* repeatable;
* validated;
* periodically tested.

Recovery planning SHOULD identify:

* recovery source;
* dependencies;
* credentials;
* expected recovery time;
* verification steps.

---

## Backup Is Not Recovery

FamilyOS distinguishes:

```text
Backup
   │
   ▼
Stored Recovery Material

Recovery
   │
   ▼
Restored Trusted Service
```

A backup that has never been successfully restored provides limited assurance.

---

## Principle 18 — Restored State Must Be Trusted

Recovery MUST restore a valid and trusted operational state.

Restoration SHOULD verify:

* data integrity;
* configuration;
* version compatibility;
* credentials;
* dependencies;
* security state.

Availability alone is not sufficient evidence of successful recovery.

---

## Principle 19 — Incidents Require Structured Response

Operational incidents MUST be handled systematically.

Incident response SHOULD prioritize:

1. detection;
2. assessment;
3. containment;
4. service restoration;
5. communication;
6. evidence preservation;
7. follow-up.

The immediate objective is to reduce impact while restoring trusted operation.

---

## Incident Lifecycle

A baseline FamilyOS incident lifecycle is:

```text
Detect
  │
  ▼
Acknowledge
  │
  ▼
Assess
  │
  ▼
Contain
  │
  ▼
Mitigate
  │
  ▼
Recover
  │
  ▼
Validate
  │
  ▼
Review
```

Incident handling SHOULD remain traceable.

---

## Principle 20 — Incident Severity Must Reflect Impact

Incidents SHOULD be classified consistently.

Severity SHOULD consider:

* affected users;
* affected services;
* data risk;
* security impact;
* duration;
* recovery complexity.

A possible baseline is:

```text
SEV-1 — Critical
SEV-2 — High
SEV-3 — Medium
SEV-4 — Low
```

Severity MUST guide response urgency rather than merely describe technical complexity.

---

## Principle 21 — Restore Service Before Perfect Diagnosis

During significant incidents, service restoration MAY take priority over complete root-cause analysis.

The operational sequence MAY be:

```text
Contain
   │
   ▼
Restore
   │
   ▼
Stabilize
   │
   ▼
Investigate
```

This principle MUST NOT override security requirements when restoration could reintroduce compromise.

---

## Principle 22 — Problems Must Be Distinguished From Incidents

An incident is an operational disruption.

A problem is an underlying cause or recurring condition.

```text
Incident
   │
   ▼
Immediate Restoration

Problem
   │
   ▼
Root Cause
   │
   ▼
Permanent Improvement
```

Repeated incidents SHOULD trigger problem-management activities.

---

## Principle 23 — Post-Incident Learning Is Mandatory

Significant incidents SHOULD produce structured learning.

Post-incident review SHOULD identify:

* what happened;
* impact;
* timeline;
* contributing factors;
* detection quality;
* response effectiveness;
* recovery effectiveness;
* required improvements.

Reviews SHOULD focus on improving systems and processes.

---

## Principle 24 — Reliability Must Be Measurable

Reliability SHOULD be expressed through measurable operational indicators.

Potential indicators include:

* availability;
* error rate;
* latency;
* recovery time;
* failure frequency;
* successful deployment rate.

Measurements SHOULD correspond to meaningful service behavior.

---

## Principle 25 — Availability Has a Cost

Availability requirements SHOULD reflect actual business and family needs.

Higher availability typically increases:

* infrastructure complexity;
* redundancy;
* operational burden;
* cost;
* testing requirements.

FamilyOS SHOULD avoid implementing unnecessary high-availability complexity without a justified requirement.

---

## Principle 26 — Capacity Must Be Managed

Operational systems SHOULD have sufficient capacity for expected workload.

Capacity planning SHOULD consider:

* compute;
* memory;
* storage;
* network;
* concurrency;
* dependency limits.

Capacity exhaustion SHOULD be observable before it becomes catastrophic where practical.

---

## Resource Limits

Operational components SHOULD define resource limits where appropriate.

Unbounded resource consumption MAY create:

* service instability;
* cascading failures;
* denial of service;
* unexpected cost.

Resource controls SHOULD be appropriate to workload behavior.

---

## Principle 27 — Operational Security Is Continuous

Security MUST remain active during operations.

Operational practices MUST preserve:

* authentication;
* authorization;
* least privilege;
* secret protection;
* secure configuration;
* auditability;
* patch management.

Operational convenience MUST NOT silently bypass security controls.

---

## Privileged Operations

Privileged operational actions SHOULD be:

* authenticated;
* authorized;
* traceable;
* limited;
* auditable.

Permanent broad administrative access SHOULD be minimized.

---

## Principle 28 — Secrets Are Not Configuration

Secrets MUST be managed independently from ordinary configuration.

Secrets include:

* passwords;
* tokens;
* private keys;
* service credentials;
* signing credentials.

Operational workflows MUST avoid exposing secrets through:

* logs;
* command output;
* source control;
* documentation;
* diagnostic artifacts.

---

## Principle 29 — Maintenance Is Planned Work

Maintenance SHOULD be treated as a controlled operational activity.

Maintenance MAY include:

* dependency upgrades;
* operating-system updates;
* database maintenance;
* certificate renewal;
* key rotation;
* storage cleanup.

Maintenance SHOULD have validation and recovery considerations.

---

## Principle 30 — Operational Drift Must Be Detectable

Actual runtime state MAY diverge from intended state.

Examples include:

* manual configuration changes;
* permission changes;
* outdated versions;
* unmanaged dependencies;
* infrastructure modifications.

Significant drift SHOULD be detectable and corrected.

---

## Principle 31 — Operational Evidence Must Be Preserved

Important operational decisions and events SHOULD produce evidence.

Evidence MAY include:

* deployment records;
* configuration changes;
* incident records;
* recovery results;
* maintenance logs;
* validation reports.

Evidence enables auditability and continuous improvement.

---

## Principle 32 — Operational Documentation Is Part of the System

Operational documentation MUST be treated as an engineering artifact.

Documentation SHOULD include:

* runbooks;
* recovery procedures;
* deployment procedures;
* escalation guidance;
* service ownership;
* dependency information.

Outdated operational documentation can itself create operational risk.

---

## Runbooks

Repeatable operational procedures SHOULD have runbooks where appropriate.

A runbook SHOULD identify:

```text
Purpose
Prerequisites
Procedure
Validation
Failure Conditions
Recovery
Escalation
```

Runbooks SHOULD be executable by a qualified operator who was not the original author.

---

## Principle 33 — Human Actions Must Be Safe

Operational interfaces SHOULD reduce the probability of accidental destructive actions.

Safeguards MAY include:

* confirmation;
* dry-run modes;
* environment identification;
* validation;
* restricted permissions;
* clear command output.

High-impact actions SHOULD be difficult to execute accidentally.

---

## Principle 34 — Production Must Be Clearly Identifiable

Operators MUST be able to distinguish production from lower environments.

Operational tools SHOULD avoid ambiguous environment context.

A command intended for development MUST NOT accidentally affect production because the active environment was unclear.

---

## Principle 35 — Operational Interfaces Must Be Predictable

CLI commands, scripts, APIs, and automation used for operations SHOULD have consistent behavior.

Operational interfaces SHOULD:

* return meaningful status;
* fail clearly;
* avoid silent partial success;
* provide actionable diagnostics.

Ambiguous operational output increases incident risk.

---

## Principle 36 — Idempotency Is Preferred

Operational actions SHOULD be idempotent where appropriate.

Repeated execution SHOULD avoid producing uncontrolled side effects.

Examples include:

* configuration application;
* infrastructure provisioning;
* service initialization;
* maintenance tasks.

Idempotency improves recovery from interrupted operations.

---

## Principle 37 — Partial Failure Must Be Considered

Multi-step operational procedures MAY fail partway through execution.

Procedures SHOULD define behavior for:

* completed steps;
* incomplete steps;
* retry;
* rollback;
* reconciliation.

Partial failure MUST NOT leave system state permanently ambiguous.

---

## Principle 38 — Dependencies Must Be Operationally Visible

Services depend on other services, infrastructure, data, and external systems.

Important dependencies SHOULD be documented and observable.

```text
Service
   │
   ├── Database
   ├── Plugin Runtime
   ├── External API
   ├── Storage
   └── Identity Service
```

Dependency failure SHOULD be distinguishable from local component failure where practical.

---

## Principle 39 — External Dependencies Must Be Treated as Unreliable

External systems are outside direct FamilyOS operational control.

FamilyOS SHOULD assume external dependencies MAY:

* become unavailable;
* become slow;
* return errors;
* change behavior;
* enforce limits.

Integration design SHOULD account for these possibilities.

---

## Principle 40 — Operational Risk Must Be Explicit

Operational decisions SHOULD consider risk.

Risk MAY derive from:

* change complexity;
* blast radius;
* reversibility;
* security impact;
* data impact;
* dependency uncertainty;
* operational novelty.

Higher-risk operations SHOULD receive stronger controls.

---

## Blast Radius

Operational changes SHOULD minimize potential blast radius.

Blast radius describes the amount of FamilyOS functionality, data, or users potentially affected by failure.

Smaller blast radius generally improves recoverability.

---

## Principle 41 — Operational Readiness Must Be Validated

A component SHOULD NOT be considered operationally ready merely because implementation is complete.

Operational readiness SHOULD verify:

* deployment;
* configuration;
* health checks;
* observability;
* dependencies;
* failure behavior;
* backup;
* recovery;
* documentation.

Readiness SHOULD produce evidence.

---

## Principle 42 — Release and Operations Must Remain Connected

Release completion represents the beginning of runtime responsibility.

The operational lifecycle is:

```text
Build
  │
  ▼
Release
  │
  ▼
Deploy
  │
  ▼
Operate
  │
  ▼
Observe
  │
  ▼
Maintain
  │
  ▼
Improve
```

Release and operations MUST NOT become disconnected processes.

---

## Principle 43 — Security and Operations Must Reinforce Each Other

Operational practices MUST implement the controls established by EPIC-SEC-001 — Security Framework.

Operations MUST preserve:

* identity boundaries;
* authorization;
* data protection;
* cryptographic requirements;
* security logging;
* secure recovery.

Operational shortcuts MUST NOT invalidate security architecture.

---

## Principle 44 — Observability and Operations Must Share Signals

EPIC-OPS-001 MUST use the common observability capabilities defined by the FamilyOS Observability Framework.

Operations SHOULD consume standardized:

* logs;
* metrics;
* traces;
* events;
* health information.

Parallel incompatible telemetry systems SHOULD be avoided without justification.

---

## Principle 45 — Testing Must Include Operational Behavior

Operational behavior SHOULD be tested where practical.

Tests MAY cover:

* deployment validation;
* configuration;
* health checks;
* recovery;
* backup restoration;
* dependency failure;
* graceful degradation.

Operational requirements MUST integrate with EPIC-TST-001 — Testing Framework.

---

## Principle 46 — Operations Is a Quality Dimension

Operational reliability is part of FamilyOS quality.

EPIC-OPS-001 MUST integrate with EPIC-QLT-001 — Quality Framework.

Operational defects MAY include:

* unreliable deployment;
* incomplete recovery;
* missing observability;
* configuration drift;
* unstable runtime behavior.

Operational quality SHOULD participate in release readiness.

---

## Principle 47 — Operations Must Be Documented

Operational architecture and procedures MUST follow EPIC-DOC-001 — Documentation Framework.

Documentation SHOULD evolve with operational behavior.

Significant operational changes SHOULD update relevant documentation in the same engineering lifecycle.

---

## Principle 48 — Operations Must Support Continuous Improvement

Operational processes SHOULD evolve based on evidence.

Improvement inputs MAY include:

* incidents;
* operational metrics;
* failed deployments;
* recovery exercises;
* capacity events;
* security findings;
* operator feedback.

Repeated operational friction SHOULD be treated as an engineering problem.

---

## Operational Feedback Loop

FamilyOS operations follows a continuous feedback model.

```text
Deploy
  │
  ▼
Operate
  │
  ▼
Observe
  │
  ▼
Detect
  │
  ▼
Respond
  │
  ▼
Learn
  │
  ▼
Improve
  │
  └────────────► Deploy
```

Operational knowledge MUST feed back into engineering.

---

## Operational Simplicity

Operational architecture SHOULD prefer the simplest model capable of meeting required reliability, security, and scalability objectives.

Complexity creates operational cost.

Every operational component introduces:

* dependencies;
* failure modes;
* maintenance;
* monitoring;
* security surface;
* recovery requirements.

Complexity SHOULD therefore be justified.

---

## Operational Consistency

Similar components SHOULD use consistent operational patterns where practical.

Consistency SHOULD apply to:

* health checks;
* logging;
* configuration;
* deployment;
* incident handling;
* runbooks;
* service metadata.

Consistency reduces cognitive load and operational errors.

---

## Operational Transparency

Operational state SHOULD be understandable.

Operators SHOULD be able to determine:

```text
What is running?
What version is running?
Is it healthy?
What changed?
What failed?
What depends on it?
How can it be restored?
```

These questions represent minimum operational visibility.

---

## Operational Trust

Operational trust MUST be based on evidence.

FamilyOS SHOULD NOT assume that a system is healthy because no incident has been reported.

Trust SHOULD derive from:

```text
Known Configuration
       +
Successful Validation
       +
Observable Health
       +
Controlled Changes
       +
Recovery Capability
       │
       ▼
Operational Confidence
```

---

## Relationship With FamilyOS Frameworks

The Operations Principles integrate with the broader FamilyOS engineering foundation.

```text
Engineering Foundation
        │
        ├── Documentation Framework
        ├── Testing Framework
        ├── Quality Framework
        ├── Build Framework
        ├── Release Framework
        ├── Observability Framework
        ├── Security Framework
        └── Operations Framework
```

EPIC-OPS-001 does not replace these frameworks.

It defines how their guarantees are preserved and exercised during runtime operation.

---

## Operational Principle Hierarchy

FamilyOS operational decisions SHOULD follow this hierarchy:

```text
Safety and Security
        │
        ▼
Data Integrity
        │
        ▼
Recoverability
        │
        ▼
Reliability
        │
        ▼
Availability
        │
        ▼
Performance
        │
        ▼
Convenience
```

Lower-priority concerns SHOULD NOT override higher-priority guarantees without explicit risk acceptance.

---

## Operations Invariants

The following invariants apply across FamilyOS operations:

1. operationally significant components MUST have identifiable responsibilities;
2. operational readiness begins during design;
3. repeated operational work SHOULD be automated where practical;
4. operational state SHOULD be reproducible;
5. configuration MUST be controlled;
6. production MUST remain distinguishable from lower environments;
7. operational changes MUST be traceable where significant;
8. deployments MUST be verified;
9. rollback and recovery MUST be considered before high-risk changes;
10. important runtime behavior MUST be observable;
11. failures MUST be expected and contained;
12. backups MUST be recoverable to provide meaningful assurance;
13. incidents MUST produce structured response;
14. significant incidents SHOULD produce learning;
15. privileged operations MUST remain controlled;
16. secrets MUST NOT be treated as ordinary configuration;
17. operational drift SHOULD be detectable;
18. operational evidence SHOULD remain available;
19. security MUST NOT be bypassed for operational convenience;
20. operations MUST continuously improve from runtime evidence.

---

## Reference Operations Model

The canonical FamilyOS operations model is:

```text
                       Engineering

This model establishes operations as a continuous lifecycle rather than the final stage of software delivery.

## Expected Outcomes

Applying the FamilyOS Operations Principles enables:

* explicit operational ownership;
* predictable environments;
* controlled configuration;
* repeatable deployments;
* safer operational changes;
* observable runtime behavior;
* reliable incident detection;
* structured incident response;
* tested recovery;
* reduced operational drift;
* improved service reliability;
* controlled operational security;
* stronger operational evidence;
* better integration between engineering and runtime operation;
* continuous operational improvement.

## Final Principle

FamilyOS operations is based on the following principle:

> A system is not operationally complete because it can be deployed; it is operationally complete when its state can be understood, its behavior can be observed, its changes can be controlled, its failures can be contained, and its trusted operation can be restored when something goes wrong.

The Operations Principles establish the behavioral foundation for every architecture, process, control, runbook, readiness gate, and operational lifecycle defined by EPIC-OPS-001.
