# Operations Framework

## EPIC-OPS-001

### Operations Framework

### Overview

EPIC-OPS-001 — Operations Framework establishes the official operational foundation for the FamilyOS ecosystem.

The framework defines how FamilyOS moves from released software into controlled, secure, observable, recoverable, and sustainable runtime operation.

It establishes the principles, architecture, lifecycle, incident-response model, recovery strategy, reliability expectations, operational-security boundaries, governance rules, implementation model, automation strategy, and validation requirements required to operate FamilyOS predictably.

The Operations Framework does not prescribe a specific infrastructure platform.

Its contracts are intended to remain applicable whether FamilyOS operates:

* locally;
* on a personal server;
* inside containers;
* on virtual machines;
* in cloud infrastructure;
* through future deployment environments.

EPIC-OPS-001 deliberately uses the compact FamilyOS framework model.

Its purpose is to establish sufficient operational architecture for implementation without creating another large documentation layer.

---

## Purpose

The Operations Framework provides the foundation required to:

* define FamilyOS runtime behavior;
* establish operational lifecycle semantics;
* manage runtime components and services;
* define health, readiness, and liveness;
* manage runtime dependencies;
* detect and classify incidents;
* contain operational failures;
* mitigate degraded conditions;
* recover from failures;
* verify recovery;
* manage capacity and performance;
* establish reliability principles;
* secure privileged operational actions;
* govern runtime changes;
* automate stable operational procedures;
* generate operational evidence;
* connect runtime experience back to engineering improvement.

The objective is not to create enterprise-scale operational infrastructure before FamilyOS requires it.

The objective is to establish a coherent operational model that can be implemented incrementally.

---

## Strategic Intent

FamilyOS already establishes how software is:

```text
Designed
   ↓
Implemented
   ↓
Tested
   ↓
Validated
   ↓
Built
   ↓
Released
   ↓
Observed
   ↓
Protected
```

EPIC-OPS-001 extends that chain with:

```text
Operated
   ↓
Recovered
   ↓
Improved
```

The Operations Framework therefore closes the gap between software delivery and sustained runtime execution.

---

## Context

A system can be correctly designed, tested, built, and released while still failing operationally.

Operational failures may arise from:

* invalid runtime configuration;
* unavailable dependencies;
* expired credentials;
* plugin failures;
* integration failures;
* resource exhaustion;
* excessive workloads;
* persistent retries;
* performance degradation;
* failed releases;
* security incidents;
* incomplete recovery procedures;
* human operational error.

EPIC-OPS-001 defines how FamilyOS prepares for, detects, manages, and learns from these conditions.

---

## Vision

The FamilyOS operational vision is:

> FamilyOS should be operable, observable, secure, diagnosable, recoverable, and maintainable through explicit runtime contracts and automation proportional to actual operational complexity.

The objective is not zero failure.

The objective is controlled failure, predictable response, and verifiable recovery.

---

## Core Operational Questions

The Operations Framework must make it possible to answer:

```text
What is running?

Which release is running?

Which configuration is active?

What should be running?

Is the runtime healthy?

Is it ready?

Which dependencies are required?

Which dependencies are failing?

What changed?

What failed?

What is affected?

How do we diagnose it?

How do we contain it?

How do we recover?

How do we verify recovery?

What evidence should remain?

What should engineering improve?
```

These questions define the core FamilyOS operational responsibility.

---

## Operational Model

The high-level operational model is:

```text
Released Artifact
       ↓
Runtime Configuration
       ↓
Validation
       ↓
Controlled Startup
       ↓
Runtime
       ↓
Health + Observability
       ↓
Operational Evaluation
       ↓
Action
       ↓
Verification
       ↓
Operational Evidence
       ↓
Engineering Improvement
```

This model applies whether actions are manual or automated.

---

## Operations as Engineering

Operations is not treated as a separate activity that begins after engineering ends.

Instead:

```text
Architecture
    ↓
Operability Requirements
    ↓
Implementation
    ↓
Testing
    ↓
Release
    ↓
Runtime
    ↓
Operational Evidence
    ↓
Engineering Feedback
```

Operability is therefore an engineering quality.

---

## Operability

A FamilyOS component is operable when its runtime behavior is sufficiently:

```text
Understandable
Observable
Configurable
Controllable
Diagnosable
Recoverable
Testable
Automatable
```

Not every component requires the same operational sophistication.

Operability remains proportional to responsibility and risk.

---

## Architecture Position

The Operations Framework sits at the end of the current broad FamilyOS engineering foundation sequence.

```text
Engineering
    ↓
Testing
    ↓
Quality
    ↓
Build
    ↓
Release
    ↓
Observability
    ↓
Security
    ↓
Operations
    ↓
Implementation and Runtime Evolution
```

Operations consumes the preceding frameworks rather than replacing them.

---

## Relationship With Engineering Foundation

The Engineering Foundation defines how FamilyOS software is designed and developed.

Operations consumes those architectural decisions during runtime.

Engineering decisions affecting:

* configuration;
* dependencies;
* lifecycle;
* resource use;
* failure behavior;
* external integrations;

SHOULD consider operational consequences.

---

## Relationship With Testing

The Testing Framework verifies expected software behavior.

Operations extends testing concerns toward runtime conditions such as:

* startup;
* shutdown;
* degraded dependencies;
* timeout behavior;
* retries;
* incidents;
* recovery;
* configuration failure.

Operational behavior SHOULD be deterministic enough to test where practical.

---

## Relationship With Quality

The Quality Framework provides engineering quality expectations and evidence.

Operational quality may include:

```text
Reliability
Recoverability
Diagnosability
Performance
Operational Security
```

Operational evidence may therefore contribute to FamilyOS quality decisions.

---

## Relationship With Build

The Build Framework produces controlled artifacts.

Operations consumes those artifacts.

Runtime identity SHOULD remain traceable to the build and release that produced the active artifact.

---

## Relationship With Release

The Release Framework determines which artifacts are approved for publication.

Operations activates and manages approved artifacts.

The boundary is:

```text
Release Candidate
       ↓
Release Validation
       ↓
Approved Artifact
       ↓
Operational Activation
       ↓
Runtime
```

Operations MUST NOT create an independent competing release lifecycle.

---

## Relationship With Observability

EPIC-OBS-001 provides the runtime evidence required by operations.

Observability answers:

```text
What is happening?
```

Operations answers:

```text
What should happen next?
```

The relationship is:

```text
Runtime
   ↓
Observability
   ↓
Understanding
   ↓
Operational Decision
   ↓
Action
   ↓
Verification
```

Operations MUST reuse FamilyOS observability contracts.

---

## Relationship With Security

EPIC-SEC-001 establishes:

* authentication;
* authorization;
* least privilege;
* secret protection;
* trust boundaries;
* security evidence.

Operations applies those controls to runtime management.

Privileged operational actions MUST NOT become security bypasses.

---

## Relationship With Plugin Compliance

Operationally relevant plugin requirements may be validated through the existing Plugin Compliance Framework.

EPIC-OPS-001 defines common operational expectations.

Plugin Compliance may validate applicable plugin conformance.

---

## Runtime Identity

Every meaningful runtime SHOULD provide enough information to determine what software is executing.

Runtime identity may include:

```text
application
release
build
environment
instance
configuration revision
```

The exact representation depends on implementation.

At minimum, the active release should be identifiable.

---

## Runtime Traceability

The expected chain is:

```text
Source
  ↓
Build
  ↓
Artifact
  ↓
Release
  ↓
Runtime
```

Operational evidence should remain traceable to the runtime that generated it.

---

## Operational Units

An operational unit is a runtime element for which independent operational state provides useful value.

Examples may include:

* FamilyOS process;
* plugin;
* worker;
* scheduler;
* repository adapter;
* external integration;
* long-running service.

Operational units are logical concepts.

They do not automatically require separate processes or services.

---

## Runtime Lifecycle

The conceptual runtime lifecycle is:

```text
CREATED
   ↓
CONFIGURING
   ↓
VALIDATING
   ↓
STARTING
   ↓
READY
   ↓
RUNNING
   ↓
STOPPING
   ↓
STOPPED
```

Failure may also produce states such as:

```text
DEGRADED
UNHEALTHY
FAILED
```

Implementation should use only the states it actually needs.

---

## Startup

Startup is not complete merely because a process exists.

Critical requirements should be evaluated before readiness.

Potential checks include:

* configuration;
* critical dependencies;
* required credentials;
* repository availability;
* plugin initialization;
* security configuration.

The runtime must not claim readiness prematurely.

---

## Shutdown

Stateful runtime components SHOULD support controlled shutdown when required.

Shutdown may involve:

```text
Stop New Work
     ↓
Handle Active Work
     ↓
Persist Required State
     ↓
Release Resources
     ↓
STOPPED
```

The exact sequence remains component-specific.

---

## Health

FamilyOS uses a common operational health vocabulary:

```text
HEALTHY
DEGRADED
UNHEALTHY
UNKNOWN
```

Health describes operational ability, not merely process existence.

---

## Readiness

Readiness answers:

> Can the operational unit safely perform its intended responsibilities now?

A component may be alive without being ready.

---

## Liveness

Liveness answers:

> Is the operational unit still capable of making progress?

Readiness, liveness, and health remain related but distinct concepts.

---

## Desired and Actual State

Operations distinguishes:

```text
Desired State
```

from:

```text
Actual State
```

Example:

```text
Desired: READY
Actual:  DEGRADED
```

The difference creates an operational condition requiring evaluation.

---

## Operational Control Loop

The conceptual control loop is:

```text
Desired State
      ↓
Runtime
      ↓
Observation
      ↓
Evaluation
      ↓
Operational Action
      ↓
Verification
      └──────────► Runtime
```

Automation may eventually execute stable portions of this loop.

---

## Configuration

Runtime configuration SHOULD be:

* explicit;
* validated;
* secure;
* reproducible where practical;
* environment-aware.

Critical invalid configuration should fail predictably.

---

## Configuration Flow

The expected model is:

```text
Configuration Source
        ↓
Load
        ↓
Validate
        ↓
Security Validation
        ↓
Runtime Configuration
```

Invalid critical configuration must not silently downgrade into unsafe operation.

---

## Configuration Drift

Unexpected difference between intended and active configuration can create operational and security problems.

FamilyOS SHOULD minimize undocumented runtime configuration changes.

Drift detection may be introduced when deployment maturity requires it.

---

## Dependencies

Operationally relevant dependencies SHOULD be explicit.

FamilyOS recognizes conceptually:

```text
Critical Dependency
Optional Dependency
Conditional Dependency
```

Dependency classification determines expected failure behavior.

---

## Critical Dependencies

Failure of a critical dependency may prevent startup, readiness, or essential runtime operation.

---

## Optional Dependencies

Failure of an optional dependency SHOULD allow degraded operation where architecture permits.

Example:

```text
Optional Integration Failure
          ↓
Affected Capability Unavailable
          ↓
Runtime DEGRADED
```

---

## Conditional Dependencies

A conditional dependency exists only when a particular capability or configuration requires it.

This prevents unnecessary runtime coupling.

---

## Failure Isolation

FamilyOS SHOULD contain operational failure within the smallest practical boundary.

Preferred:

```text
Local Failure
     ↓
Local Impact
```

rather than:

```text
Local Failure
     ↓
Global Platform Failure
```

unless the dependency is genuinely critical.

---

## Graceful Degradation

Where possible, FamilyOS SHOULD preserve unaffected capabilities during partial failure.

A degraded runtime must remain observable.

---

## External Dependencies

External systems should be assumed capable of:

```text
Failure
Latency
Unavailable Responses
Changed Responses
Credential Expiration
Network Failure
```

FamilyOS should therefore use appropriate:

* timeouts;
* bounded retries;
* validation;
* failure isolation;
* security controls.

---

## Timeouts

Operations that could block indefinitely SHOULD use bounded execution where appropriate.

Timeouts should produce explicit operational evidence.

---

## Retries

Retries MAY be used for transient failures.

Retries MUST be:

```text
Bounded
Observable
Semantically Safe
```

Infinite retry is prohibited.

---

## Idempotency

Operations that may be retried SHOULD consider duplicate execution.

Where possible, retryable operations should be idempotent.

Where this is impossible, retry behavior must explicitly account for side effects.

---

## Resource Management

Runtime resources may include:

```text
CPU
Memory
Storage
Connections
Workers
Queues
External Quotas
```

FamilyOS SHOULD avoid uncontrolled resource growth.

---

## Bounded Resources

Operational components such as:

* queues;
* retry buffers;
* caches;
* worker pools;

SHOULD have intentional bounds when unbounded growth creates reliability risk.

---

## Capacity

Capacity represents the resources available to handle expected workload.

Initial capacity management should focus on:

```text
Measurement
Awareness
Limits
```

rather than premature dynamic scaling infrastructure.

---

## Performance

Operational performance may be evaluated through:

* latency;
* throughput;
* duration;
* resource utilization;
* queue depth;
* failure rate.

Performance should be measured before significant optimization.

---

## Reliability

FamilyOS reliability combines:

```text
Correctness
     +
Availability
     +
Failure Isolation
     +
Recovery
     +
Operational Visibility
```

Reliability is not equivalent to uptime alone.

---

## Reliability Engineering

Reliability SHOULD improve through:

* simpler architecture;
* known dependencies;
* bounded failure;
* predictable recovery;
* operational testing;
* runtime evidence;
* incident learning.

---

## Reliability Targets

Formal SLOs are not required initially.

FamilyOS MAY introduce measurable reliability targets when actual deployment requirements justify them.

---

## Incident Definition

An incident is an operational condition requiring managed response because it causes or threatens meaningful impact.

Not every error is an incident.

The conceptual progression is:

```text
Event
  ↓
Failure
  ↓
Alert
  ↓
Incident
```

only when impact and response requirements justify escalation.

---

## Incident Lifecycle

FamilyOS uses the conceptual incident lifecycle:

```text
Detection
   ↓
Assessment
   ↓
Classification
   ↓
Containment
   ↓
Mitigation
   ↓
Recovery
   ↓
Verification
   ↓
Resolution
   ↓
Review
```

The process remains proportional to severity.

---

## Incident Severity

A compact severity model is:

```text
LOW
MEDIUM
HIGH
CRITICAL
```

Severity should reflect:

* impact;
* scope;
* urgency;
* security;
* data sensitivity;
* recoverability.

---

## Containment

Containment limits ongoing damage before complete recovery.

Potential actions include:

```text
Disable Plugin
Disable Integration
Stop Worker
Reject New Work
Revoke Credential
Isolate Component
```

Containment should preserve relevant evidence where practical.

---

## Recovery

Recovery restores FamilyOS toward an acceptable operational state.

Recovery mechanisms may include:

```text
Restart
Retry
Reconfigure
Restore Dependency
Isolate Plugin
Rollback
Restore Data
Rotate Credential
```

The mechanism should match the failure.

---

## Recovery Verification

Recovery is not complete when the action finishes.

The required model is:

```text
Recovery Action
      ↓
Runtime Observation
      ↓
Health Validation
      ↓
Functional Validation
      ↓
Recovery Confirmed
```

This is a core EPIC-OPS-001 invariant.

---

## Failed Recovery

A failed recovery must remain visible.

It must not produce a false successful or resolved state.

Failed recovery should result in reassessment or escalation.

---

## Rollback

Release rollback remains owned by EPIC-REL-001.

Operations may initiate or coordinate rollback when runtime evidence demonstrates that the active release is unsuitable.

Only known approved artifacts should be rollback targets.

---

## Backup

Persistent FamilyOS information may require backups.

Backup creation alone does not demonstrate recoverability.

---

## Restore

A complete recovery model is:

```text
Backup
   ↓
Restore
   ↓
Integrity Validation
   ↓
Runtime Validation
   ↓
Functional Validation
```

A backup that cannot be restored successfully provides limited operational value.

---

## Operational Security

Privileged operational actions remain subject to EPIC-SEC-001.

Examples include:

* service control;
* configuration changes;
* plugin isolation;
* diagnostic access;
* secret rotation;
* rollback;
* restore.

---

## Privileged Action Model

The expected flow is:

```text
Actor
  ↓
Authentication
  ↓
Authorization
  ↓
Operational Action
  ↓
Verification
  ↓
Evidence
```

Administrative tooling MUST NOT bypass security controls.

---

## Least Privilege

Humans and automation SHOULD receive only the operational permissions required for their responsibilities.

Observation and state modification should remain distinguishable where practical.

---

## High-Risk Operations

High-risk actions may include:

```text
Destructive Restore
Sensitive Configuration Change
Credential Rotation
Security Policy Modification
Production Rollback
Irreversible Maintenance
```

Such actions MAY require additional validation or human approval.

---

## Operational Secrets

Runtime secrets remain governed by EPIC-SEC-001.

Operational configuration SHOULD prefer secret references rather than embedded secret values.

Secrets MUST NOT intentionally appear in:

* logs;
* metrics;
* traces;
* diagnostics;
* incident summaries;
* CLI output.

---

## Operational Governance

Governance exists to ensure significant operational changes are intentional, authorized, and verified.

It should remain proportional to risk.

A conceptual governance model is:

```text
Routine
Controlled
High-Risk
Emergency
```

Not every runtime action needs the same process.

---

## Change Governance

A meaningful operational change follows:

```text
Propose
   ↓
Validate
   ↓
Authorize
   ↓
Execute
   ↓
Observe
   ↓
Verify
   ↓
Record
```

Low-risk deterministic portions may be automated.

---

## Environment Safety

Where multiple environments exist, significant operational actions SHOULD identify their target environment explicitly.

Environment ambiguity must not become normal operational behavior.

---

## Operational Ownership

Operationally significant components SHOULD have identifiable responsibility.

FamilyOS should be able to answer:

```text
Who understands this component?

Who can approve major changes?

Who responds when it fails?

Who owns recovery?
```

One person may hold all roles in a small project.

---

## Observability Integration

Operations MUST reuse EPIC-OBS-001 for:

```text
Logs
Metrics
Traces
Health
Diagnostics
Correlation
```

Operations must not create an independent telemetry architecture.

---

## Operational Evidence

Significant runtime activity SHOULD produce enough evidence to determine:

```text
What happened?
When?
Which component?
Which runtime version?
Which operation?
What result?
```

Evidence should remain structured and privacy-safe where practical.

---

## Evidence Correlation

Operational evidence may use identifiers such as:

```text
release_id
runtime_id
component_id
operation_id
correlation_id
incident_id
```

Only identifiers with actual diagnostic value should be included.

---

## Operational Privacy

Operational tooling SHOULD observe system behavior rather than unnecessarily exposing private family content.

Diagnostics, incidents, and runtime evidence must respect data-minimization principles.

---

## Alerting

Alerts should represent actionable operational conditions.

The rule is:

```text
Actionable Condition
        ↓
Alert
```

not:

```text
Every Event
    ↓
Alert
```

Alert noise is an operational defect.

---

## Automation

Stable, repeatable operational procedures SHOULD be candidates for automation.

Potential examples include:

* startup validation;
* health checks;
* deployment verification;
* bounded recovery;
* configuration checks;
* scheduled maintenance;
* recovery verification.

---

## Automation Model

Operational automation follows:

```text
Trigger
   ↓
Preconditions
   ↓
Authorization
   ↓
Action
   ↓
Verification
   ↓
Evidence
```

Automation without verification is incomplete.

---

## Automation Guardrails

Automated actions SHOULD define:

* scope;
* preconditions;
* maximum attempts;
* failure behavior;
* escalation;
* expected result.

Automation MUST NOT repeat privileged operations indefinitely.

---

## Human Control

Human control should remain available for:

* destructive recovery;
* ambiguous incidents;
* critical security changes;
* irreversible state modification;
* uncertain data restoration.

FamilyOS should automate deterministic mechanics, not eliminate judgment.

---

## Implementation Strategy

Implementation should remain incremental.

A suitable progression is:

```text
Operational Models
       ↓
Runtime Lifecycle
       ↓
Health
       ↓
Dependency Management
       ↓
Incident Model
       ↓
Recovery
       ↓
Security Integration
       ↓
Automation
       ↓
Validation
```

---

## Minimal Initial Implementation

The minimum useful operational implementation is:

```text
Released Artifact
      ↓
Validated Configuration
      ↓
Controlled Startup
      ↓
Runtime Health
      ↓
Operational Evidence
      ↓
Controlled Recovery
      ↓
Recovery Verification
```

A large operational platform is not required.

---

## Candidate Core Models

Implementation MAY begin with models such as:

```text
OperationalState
HealthStatus
HealthResult
DependencyStatus
OperationalAction
OperationalResult
Incident
IncidentSeverity
RecoveryAction
RecoveryResult
```

Only models justified by implementation should become permanent abstractions.

---

## Vendor Neutrality

FamilyOS operations should remain independent of specific infrastructure vendors.

The architecture should follow:

```text
FamilyOS Operations
        ↓
Operational Contract
        ↓
Adapter
        ↓
Infrastructure Provider
```

This preserves future deployment flexibility.

---

## Local Development

Operational architecture MUST remain usable during local development.

Developers should be able to:

```text
Configure
   ↓
Start
   ↓
Inspect Health
   ↓
Exercise Runtime
   ↓
Stop
```

without enterprise infrastructure.

---

## Testing

Operational behavior SHOULD support deterministic automated tests.

Useful test techniques may include:

* fake clocks;
* in-memory repositories;
* synthetic health probes;
* controlled dependency failures;
* fake runtime controllers;
* deterministic recovery.

---

## Failure Injection

Controlled failure injection MAY verify:

* timeouts;
* dependency failure;
* plugin startup failure;
* invalid configuration;
* recovery;
* escalation.

Failure injection must remain safe and deterministic.

---

## Engineering Quality

Applicable implementation must continue to satisfy existing FamilyOS engineering requirements.

At minimum:

```text
Ruff
MyPy
Pytest
```

must pass for affected implementation scope.

---

## Release Integration

Operational validation may contribute to release decisions.

A release may require runtime checks such as:

```text
Startup
   ↓
Readiness
   ↓
Health
   ↓
Critical Functional Check
```

Release governance itself remains owned by EPIC-REL-001.

---

## Deployment Verification

Artifact transfer alone does not establish deployment success.

The intended model is:

```text
Deploy
   ↓
Start Runtime
   ↓
Readiness
   ↓
Health
   ↓
Critical Validation
   ↓
Deployment Verified
```

---

## Runtime Feedback

Operational evidence should feed improvements into:

* architecture;
* tests;
* security;
* observability;
* quality;
* release validation.

This creates the operational feedback loop.

---

## Post-Incident Improvement

Meaningful incidents may lead to:

```text
Code Fix
Test
New Validation
Improved Telemetry
Permission Change
Runbook
Automation
Architecture Improvement
```

The objective is lasting engineering improvement rather than incident paperwork.

---

## Architectural Constraints

EPIC-OPS-001 establishes the following constraints:

* operations MUST reuse the Observability Framework;
* privileged operations MUST follow Security Framework controls;
* runtime identity SHOULD remain traceable to release;
* critical configuration MUST be validated;
* health semantics SHOULD remain explicit;
* dependency criticality SHOULD be explicit where operationally relevant;
* retries MUST be bounded;
* recovery SHOULD be verified;
* automation SHOULD produce evidence;
* operations SHOULD remain vendor-neutral where practical;
* operational complexity MUST remain proportional to actual requirements.

---

## Core Invariants

### Runtime Identity

Meaningful runtime execution should be traceable to an approved FamilyOS release.

### Configuration Validation

Critical invalid configuration must not silently proceed.

### Explicit Health

Operationally significant runtime state should be understandable.

### Failure Visibility

Significant failure must produce sufficient operational evidence.

### Security Enforcement

Operational urgency must not automatically bypass applicable security controls.

### Bounded Retry

Automatic retry must not continue indefinitely.

### Recovery Verification

Recovery is incomplete until the resulting state is validated.

### Framework Reuse

Operations must consume rather than duplicate existing FamilyOS framework capabilities.

### Proportional Complexity

Infrastructure sophistication must follow concrete requirements.

---

## Anti-Patterns

EPIC-OPS-001 rejects several operational anti-patterns.

### Infrastructure First

Complex infrastructure should not be introduced before the operational problem is understood.

### Hidden Runtime State

Important runtime behavior must not depend on invisible state.

### Implicit Dependencies

Critical runtime dependencies must not remain accidental.

### Infinite Retry

Retries require limits and failure escalation.

### Restart as Universal Recovery

Restart is one recovery technique, not the operational strategy.

### Alert Everything

Non-actionable alerting reduces operational effectiveness.

### Automation Without Verification

Execution does not prove success.

### Security Bypass

Administrative or emergency context does not automatically eliminate security controls.

### Documentation Instead of Implementation

Once the framework is validated, implementation becomes the priority.

---

## Scope

EPIC-OPS-001 covers:

* operations principles;
* operations architecture;
* runtime lifecycle;
* service management;
* health;
* readiness;
* dependencies;
* incident response;
* recovery;
* performance;
* capacity;
* reliability;
* operational security;
* governance;
* implementation;
* automation;
* validation;
* release integration.

---

## Out of Scope

EPIC-OPS-001 does not require immediate implementation of:

* Kubernetes;
* enterprise orchestration platforms;
* global multi-region infrastructure;
* enterprise service-management suites;
* Network Operations Centers;
* Security Operations Centers;
* formal SRE organizations;
* enterprise disaster-recovery platforms;
* automatic horizontal scaling;
* full 24/7 operational staffing;
* large-scale distributed infrastructure.

These capabilities may be introduced later if real FamilyOS requirements justify them.

---

## Documentation Strategy

EPIC-OPS-001 uses the compact FamilyOS framework model.

The canonical document set is limited to exactly 10 documents.

The documentation exists to establish sufficient architecture for implementation.

Additional broad framework documentation is not required unless implementation exposes a concrete architectural gap.

---

## Canonical Framework Documents

The complete canonical document set is:

```text
00-EPIC.md
01-Context-and-Vision.md
02-Operations-Principles.md
03-Operations-Architecture.md
04-Runtime-and-Service-Management.md
05-Incident-Response-and-Recovery.md
06-Capacity-Performance-and-Reliability.md
07-Operational-Security-and-Governance.md
08-Implementation-and-Automation.md
09-Validation-and-Release.md
```

These 10 documents constitute the complete EPIC-OPS-001 Operations Framework baseline.

---

## Deliverables

EPIC-OPS-001 delivers:

* Operations context and vision;
* Operations principles;
* Operations architecture;
* runtime and service-management model;
* health, readiness, and dependency semantics;
* incident-response model;
* recovery architecture;
* capacity-management principles;
* performance model;
* reliability model;
* operational-security requirements;
* operational-governance rules;
* implementation strategy;
* automation strategy;
* validation and release requirements.

---

## Validation

The framework must demonstrate architectural sufficiency for:

```text
Runtime Identity
Lifecycle
Configuration
Dependencies
Health
Readiness
Failure Isolation
Incidents
Recovery
Verification
Capacity
Performance
Reliability
Security
Governance
Automation
Evidence
```

Detailed validation requirements are defined in `09-Validation-and-Release.md`.

---

## Post-EPIC Rule

After EPIC-OPS-001 is validated and released, FamilyOS SHOULD stop creating broad engineering-framework documentation unless implementation reveals a genuine architectural gap.

The workflow becomes:

```text
Architecture
    ↓
Implementation
    ↓
Testing
    ↓
Integration
    ↓
Validation
    ↓
Release
    ↓
Runtime
    ↓
Improvement
```

This is an explicit transition away from framework expansion and toward product development.

---

## Foundation Completion

EPIC-OPS-001 closes the planned broad engineering foundation sequence:

```text
Engineering
    ↓
Documentation
    ↓
Testing
    ↓
Quality
    ↓
Build
    ↓
Release
    ↓
Observability
    ↓
Security
    ↓
Operations
```

The next primary phase is implementation.

---

## Success Criteria

EPIC-OPS-001 succeeds when FamilyOS has enough operational architecture to answer:

```text
What is running?

Which release is active?

How does runtime start?

How is readiness determined?

How is health evaluated?

Which dependencies are critical?

How does degradation work?

How are incidents managed?

How is recovery performed?

How is recovery verified?

How is capacity evaluated?

How is performance measured?

How is reliability improved?

How are privileged operations protected?

How are runtime changes governed?

Which procedures should be automated?

How does operational evidence improve engineering?
```

---

## Expected Outcome

After EPIC-OPS-001, FamilyOS will possess a coherent operational model that is:

```text
Explicit
Observable
Secure
Diagnosable
Reliable
Recoverable
Verifiable
Testable
Automatable
Vendor-Neutral
Proportional
```

The platform will be architecturally prepared to move from released software to sustainable real-world operation.

## Conclusion

EPIC-OPS-001 completes the broad FamilyOS engineering foundation by defining how released software becomes controlled runtime operation.

Its architecture centers on:

```text
Explicit Runtime State
       +
Validated Configuration
       +
Health
       +
Observability
       +
Failure Isolation
       +
Incident Response
       +
Recovery
       +
Security
       +
Verification
       +
Automation
       =
Operable FamilyOS
```

The governing principle is:

> FamilyOS is operationally complete only when its runtime state can be understood, significant failure can be detected and contained, recovery can be performed predictably, and the resulting state can be verified.

With this framework established, the priority shifts from documenting broad foundations to implementing and exercising the FamilyOS architecture.
