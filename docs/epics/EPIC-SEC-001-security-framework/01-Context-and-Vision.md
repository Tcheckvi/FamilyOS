# Security Framework

## EPIC-SEC-001

### Context and Vision

### Overview

This document defines the context, motivation, strategic vision, and architectural direction of the FamilyOS Security Framework.

FamilyOS is evolving from an engineering platform into a system capable of managing long-lived digital family information, capabilities, workflows, plugins, integrations, and automation.

As this evolution continues, security can no longer be treated as a collection of isolated implementation decisions.

Security must become a coherent platform capability.

EPIC-SEC-001 establishes that capability.

The objective is to create a security foundation that protects FamilyOS without introducing unnecessary complexity, excessive infrastructure, or architecture that cannot yet be justified by real requirements.

---

## Context

FamilyOS has progressively established its engineering foundations.

The platform now includes frameworks governing:

```text
Engineering
Documentation
Testing
Quality
Build
Release
Plugin Compliance
Observability
```

These foundations define how FamilyOS is designed, developed, validated, built, released, and observed.

Security is the next required cross-cutting capability.

Without a platform-level security architecture, the guarantees provided by the existing engineering foundations remain incomplete.

---

## Strategic Position

The Security Framework sits between observability and future operations.

```text
Engineering
    ↓
Testing
    ↓
Quality
    ↓
Build
    ↓
Release
    ↓
Observability
    ↓
Security
    ↓
Operations
```

This position is intentional.

Observability makes runtime behavior understandable.

Security defines which runtime behavior is permitted and how protected resources must be handled.

Operations will later maintain and respond to these guarantees during actual system execution.

---

## Why Security Is Required Now

FamilyOS already contains architectural concepts that introduce security responsibilities.

These include:

* identities;
* families;
* plugins;
* capabilities;
* repositories;
* documents;
* communications;
* financial information;
* health-related capabilities;
* integrations;
* configuration;
* workflows;
* automation.

As implementation expands, these components will increasingly interact.

Without common security contracts, security decisions would become distributed across unrelated modules.

That would create inconsistent behavior and make the platform difficult to secure or audit.

---

## Security as Architecture

Security is not simply:

```text
passwords
+
encryption
+
permissions
```

Security is an architectural property governing how components interact.

The FamilyOS security model therefore considers:

```text
Identity
   ↓
Authentication
   ↓
Security Context
   ↓
Authorization
   ↓
Capability
   ↓
Protected Resource
```

Security must exist across this entire path.

---

## FamilyOS Security Challenge

FamilyOS has a particular security challenge.

The platform is intended to manage information that may remain valuable and sensitive for many years.

Examples may include:

* family identity information;
* family documents;
* communications;
* financial records;
* educational information;
* historical records;
* security information;
* future inherited digital assets.

Security decisions therefore have potentially long-lived consequences.

The architecture must support protection without making future evolution impossible.

---

## Long-Lived Information

Traditional applications may treat information as short-lived operational data.

FamilyOS may preserve information across:

```text
Years
  ↓
Decades
  ↓
Generations
```

This creates additional considerations around:

* access control;
* cryptographic evolution;
* data migration;
* key management;
* archival protection;
* ownership transitions;
* future compatibility.

EPIC-SEC-001 does not solve every long-term preservation problem.

It ensures that the security architecture does not prevent future solutions.

---

## Family Trust Model

FamilyOS operates in a domain where trust cannot be represented by a single binary state.

Family relationships do not automatically imply unrestricted digital access.

For example:

```text
Family Member
      ≠
Access To Everything
```

Security decisions must remain explicit.

Family relationships may influence authorization policy, but they must not replace authorization.

---

## Digital Family Boundaries

A FamilyOS family represents a logical domain boundary.

However, multiple security scopes may exist inside that boundary.

Conceptually:

```text
Family
  │
  ├── Shared Resources
  │
  ├── Personal Resources
  │
  ├── Restricted Resources
  │
  └── Administrative Resources
```

The Security Framework must support these distinctions without embedding specific future product policies prematurely.

---

## Actors

FamilyOS may eventually support multiple categories of actors.

Examples include:

```text
Person
Family Member
Family Administrator
Service
Plugin
Automation
External Integration
System Process
```

Different actors may require different authentication mechanisms and authorization models.

The framework must support this diversity without creating separate security architectures for each actor type.

---

## Protected Resources

Security applies to more than persisted data.

Protected resources may include:

* entities;
* documents;
* commands;
* capabilities;
* workflows;
* repositories;
* configuration;
* secrets;
* integrations;
* administrative operations;
* runtime diagnostics.

Authorization should therefore be capability-aware rather than limited to file or database access.

---

## Capabilities as Security Boundaries

FamilyOS already uses capabilities as architectural concepts.

Capabilities provide a natural location for security enforcement.

Conceptually:

```text
Actor
   ↓
Security Context
   ↓
Authorization
   ↓
Capability
   ↓
Domain Operation
```

This allows authorization to remain close to meaningful operations.

It also avoids distributing permission logic throughout low-level implementation details.

---

## Security and Domain Logic

Security policy and domain logic must cooperate without becoming inseparable.

Domain code may need to express:

```text
This operation requires permission X.
```

It should not need to know:

```text
which authentication provider was used
how tokens were validated
where credentials are stored
which external authorization engine exists
```

This separation preserves Clean Architecture principles.

---

## Trust Is Explicit

FamilyOS adopts explicit trust.

Trust should not be inferred solely because:

* code is internal;
* a plugin is official;
* a caller is authenticated;
* a service runs locally;
* an integration was configured;
* data came from another FamilyOS component.

Every important trust boundary should have explicit assumptions.

---

## Internal Does Not Mean Trusted

A common security mistake is assuming that internal components require no security boundaries.

FamilyOS rejects this assumption.

Conceptually:

```text
Internal
   ≠
Automatically Trusted
```

Internal components may contain defects, compromised dependencies, incorrect configuration, or excessive privileges.

Security architecture must limit the consequences of such failures where practical.

---

## Plugin Context

Plugins are fundamental to FamilyOS extensibility.

They also introduce important security concerns.

A plugin may potentially:

* process protected information;
* execute capabilities;
* access repositories;
* communicate externally;
* consume secrets;
* emit observability signals;
* participate in workflows.

Plugin security must therefore be part of the platform architecture.

---

## Official Plugins

Official plugins are maintained as part of the FamilyOS ecosystem.

They may receive stronger architectural trust than unknown third-party plugins.

However:

> Official does not mean unrestricted.

Official plugins remain subject to platform security contracts.

---

## Third-Party Plugins

Third-party plugins represent stronger trust boundaries.

FamilyOS should assume that such plugins may require:

* explicit capability declarations;
* permission validation;
* configuration validation;
* dependency validation;
* restricted platform interfaces;
* compliance verification.

Future implementation may strengthen isolation as the plugin ecosystem evolves.

---

## Existing Security Plugin

FamilyOS already contains a Security Plugin associated with RFC-0010.

This creates an important distinction.

The Security Plugin is not the Security Framework.

Conceptually:

```text
EPIC-SEC-001
Security Framework
       │
       └── governs platform security

RFC-0010
Security Plugin
       │
       └── provides extensible security capabilities
```

The framework defines universal security expectations.

The plugin operates within those expectations.

---

## Avoiding Security Duplication

EPIC-SEC-001 MUST NOT duplicate capabilities already belonging to:

* Identity architecture;
* Security Plugin;
* Testing Framework;
* Quality Framework;
* Build Framework;
* Release Framework;
* Plugin Compliance Framework;
* Observability Framework.

Instead, it defines how these capabilities participate in platform security.

---

## Relationship With Identity

Identity establishes representation of actors.

Security establishes how those actors prove identity and obtain access.

```text
Identity
   ↓
Authentication
   ↓
Authorization
   ↓
Protected Operation
```

Identity and security therefore cooperate while remaining architecturally distinct.

---

## Relationship With Testing

Security requirements without tests are difficult to trust.

The Testing Framework provides the mechanisms required to turn security expectations into executable evidence.

Security tests may verify:

* permission enforcement;
* denied operations;
* invalid authentication;
* unsafe configuration;
* secret leakage;
* malicious input;
* plugin boundaries.

---

## Relationship With Quality

Security contributes directly to FamilyOS quality.

Security defects may affect:

```text
Confidentiality
Integrity
Availability
Trust
```

The Quality Framework may therefore consume security validation results as quality evidence.

---

## Relationship With Build

The Build Framework protects artifact creation and reproducibility.

Security extends these guarantees through concerns such as:

* dependency integrity;
* secret exclusion;
* supply-chain validation;
* build configuration;
* artifact trust.

---

## Relationship With Release

The Release Framework controls publication.

Security may introduce release gates where critical security requirements must pass before publication.

Examples may include:

```text
security tests
dependency validation
secret validation
permission regression tests
```

---

## Relationship With Observability

Security depends on runtime evidence.

The Observability Framework provides structured mechanisms for:

* logs;
* metrics;
* traces;
* health;
* diagnostics;
* correlation.

Security can consume this evidence to understand security-relevant runtime behavior.

---

## Security Observability

Security-relevant events may include:

```text
authentication.failed
authorization.denied
security.configuration.invalid
plugin.permission.denied
secret.access.failed
integrity.validation.failed
```

These signals must remain privacy-safe and must never expose secrets merely because they describe security activity.

---

## Relationship With Operations

The future Operations Framework will use security and observability together.

Conceptually:

```text
Runtime
   │
   ├── Observability
   │
   └── Security
   │
   ▼
Operations
```

Operations may eventually support:

* security monitoring;
* response;
* recovery;
* credential rotation;
* dependency remediation;
* operational security controls.

EPIC-SEC-001 establishes the contracts required for those future capabilities.

---

## Security Vision

The long-term security vision is:

```text
Explicit Identity
       +
Strong Boundaries
       +
Least Privilege
       +
Protected Data
       +
Controlled Capabilities
       +
Observable Security
       +
Automated Validation
       =
Trustworthy FamilyOS
```

Security should become a predictable property of the platform rather than an implementation detail.

---

## Secure by Design

FamilyOS follows secure-by-design principles.

Security considerations should occur during:

```text
Architecture
    ↓
Design
    ↓
Implementation
    ↓
Testing
    ↓
Build
    ↓
Release
    ↓
Runtime
```

Security added only after implementation is more expensive and less reliable.

---

## Secure by Default

FamilyOS should operate safely without requiring extensive manual hardening.

Examples include:

* deny by default;
* minimal permissions;
* external access disabled unless configured;
* safe diagnostic behavior;
* secrets excluded from source control;
* validated security configuration.

Users should not need to discover hidden security requirements to obtain safe behavior.

---

## Least Privilege Vision

Privileges should be:

```text
Minimal
Scoped
Explicit
Reviewable
Revocable
```

Broad permanent permissions should be avoided.

Where practical, permissions should correspond to meaningful FamilyOS capabilities.

---

## Authorization Vision

Authorization should answer:

```text
Who
can perform
What operation
on Which resource
under Which conditions?
```

This model supports future evolution without requiring authorization logic to depend entirely on simple roles.

Roles may still provide useful policy composition.

---

## Policy Evolution

Initial FamilyOS authorization may remain simple.

The architecture should nevertheless support future evolution toward more expressive policy without replacing fundamental contracts.

Conceptually:

```text
Simple Permission Checks
          ↓
Role-Based Policies
          ↓
Context-Aware Policies
```

Only real requirements should justify additional complexity.

---

## Data Protection Vision

FamilyOS should protect data according to:

* sensitivity;
* ownership;
* context;
* lifecycle;
* authorization.

The system should avoid treating every piece of information identically.

This allows security controls to remain proportional.

---

## Privacy Alignment

Security and privacy are closely related but not identical.

Security protects information and capabilities against unauthorized behavior.

Privacy governs appropriate use and exposure of personal information.

EPIC-SEC-001 incorporates privacy-aware security practices such as:

* data minimization;
* access limitation;
* safe telemetry;
* controlled diagnostics.

Broader privacy governance may evolve separately if required.

---

## Secret Protection Vision

Secrets should remain isolated from normal application configuration.

The intended model is:

```text
Application
    ↓
Secret Contract
    ↓
Approved Provider
    ↓
Protected Secret
```

Application code should consume secrets without requiring knowledge of their physical storage mechanism.

---

## Cryptographic Vision

Cryptography should be:

```text
Standard
Reviewed
Replaceable
Purpose-Specific
```

FamilyOS must not invent cryptographic algorithms.

Cryptographic choices should remain replaceable because algorithms, libraries, and security recommendations evolve.

---

## Threat-Driven Security

Security controls should exist because they mitigate identifiable risks.

The framework therefore favors:

```text
Threat
   ↓
Risk
   ↓
Control
   ↓
Validation
   ↓
Evidence
```

over:

```text
Security Tool
   ↓
Find somewhere to use it
```

This reduces unnecessary security complexity.

---

## Proportional Security

Not every component requires identical controls.

Security strength should reflect:

* sensitivity;
* exposure;
* impact;
* trust boundary;
* capability;
* threat model.

A local development helper does not necessarily require the same controls as a production secret provider.

However, fundamental invariants remain mandatory.

---

## Fundamental Invariants

Certain rules apply regardless of environment.

Examples include:

```text
Secrets are not committed.

Authorization is not silently bypassed.

Invalid security decisions do not default to allow.

Sensitive information is not intentionally exposed through telemetry.

Untrusted input is validated.

Custom cryptography is avoided.
```

Environment configuration must not disable these fundamental protections.

---

## Security Failure Philosophy

Security mechanisms must fail safely.

When security state is uncertain:

```text
Unknown Authorization
        ↓
       Deny
```

rather than:

```text
Unknown Authorization
        ↓
      Allow
```

Security failures should remain diagnosable without exposing protected information.

---

## Accountability

Important security decisions should produce sufficient evidence to understand what occurred.

Accountability does not mean recording all private information.

It means producing safe evidence about significant security decisions.

For example:

```text
Actor Context
      +
Operation
      +
Decision
      +
Reason Category
      +
Correlation
```

---

## Explainable Security

FamilyOS values explainability.

Security decisions SHOULD therefore be understandable where practical.

For example, an authorization denial should be representable through stable reason categories rather than an unexplained boolean result.

Conceptually:

```text
DENIED
because
MISSING_REQUIRED_PERMISSION
```

This improves debugging, testing, governance, and future user experience.

---

## Automation Vision

Security should increasingly become executable policy.

Examples include:

* automated permission tests;
* dependency checks;
* secret detection;
* configuration validation;
* plugin compliance;
* security regression tests;
* release gates.

Automation reduces dependence on human memory.

---

## Security Evidence Vision

Security automation should produce evidence that can participate in the broader FamilyOS engineering lifecycle.

```text
Security Requirement
        ↓
Validation
        ↓
Evidence
        ↓
Quality Gate
        ↓
Release Decision
```

This connects security to existing FamilyOS engineering foundations.

---

## Developer Experience

Security architecture must remain usable by developers.

If security APIs are excessively complex, developers may:

* bypass them;
* implement local alternatives;
* misunderstand requirements;
* introduce inconsistent controls.

FamilyOS security interfaces should therefore remain:

```text
Explicit
Small
Typed
Testable
Predictable
```

---

## Avoiding Security Theater

The Security Framework should not introduce controls merely because they appear sophisticated.

Every significant control should provide identifiable value.

FamilyOS avoids:

* unnecessary security layers;
* speculative enterprise infrastructure;
* meaningless compliance checklists;
* duplicated validation;
* tools without integration value.

Security must reduce actual risk.

---

## Avoiding Premature Infrastructure

EPIC-SEC-001 does not require immediate deployment of:

```text
SIEM
SOC
HSM
Enterprise IAM
External Policy Engine
Zero-Trust Network Platform
Dedicated Secret Cluster
```

The architecture may support future integration with such technologies without requiring them today.

---

## Local-First Development

FamilyOS should remain usable in local development environments.

Security architecture must therefore support deterministic local and test implementations.

For example:

```text
Security Contract
      │
      ├── Test Provider
      ├── Local Provider
      └── Future Production Provider
```

This allows security behavior to be tested without external infrastructure.

---

## Vendor Neutrality

Core FamilyOS security architecture SHOULD remain independent of specific security vendors.

Vendor-specific technology belongs behind adapters where practical.

Conceptually:

```text
FamilyOS Security API
        ↓
Security Adapter
        ↓
External Security Technology
```

This preserves architectural control and future replaceability.

---

## Security Maturity

FamilyOS security maturity should evolve incrementally.

A conceptual progression is:

```text
Security Principles
        ↓
Security Contracts
        ↓
Core Enforcement
        ↓
Automated Validation
        ↓
Security Evidence
        ↓
Operational Security
        ↓
Advanced Automation
```

Each stage should be driven by concrete requirements.

---

## Initial Security Focus

The initial implementation should prioritize:

1. security context;
2. authorization contracts;
3. permission representation;
4. secure defaults;
5. secret-provider abstraction;
6. security events;
7. plugin security boundaries;
8. automated security tests.

These provide high architectural value without requiring large infrastructure investments.

---

## Non-Goals

The Security Framework is not intended to:

* solve every possible cyber-security problem;
* implement every future authentication mechanism;
* define detailed organizational security procedures;
* replace specialized security standards;
* create a complete compliance certification program;
* introduce unnecessary enterprise infrastructure;
* duplicate existing FamilyOS frameworks.

Its role is to establish the FamilyOS platform security foundation.

---

## Documentation Philosophy

EPIC-SEC-001 follows the compact framework model introduced for the later FamilyOS engineering foundations.

The documentation exists to support implementation.

The framework intentionally avoids expanding into dozens of documents.

The canonical set remains:

```text
00-EPIC.md
01-Context-and-Vision.md
02-Security-Principles.md
03-Security-Architecture.md
04-Identity-Authentication-and-Authorization.md
05-Data-Secrets-and-Cryptography.md
06-Threat-Risk-and-Trust-Model.md
07-Security-Controls-and-Compliance.md
08-Implementation-and-Automation.md
09-Validation-and-Release.md
```

Once these documents establish sufficient architectural clarity, work moves to implementation.

---

## Strategic Outcome

After EPIC-SEC-001, FamilyOS should have a security architecture capable of answering:

```text
What are we protecting?

From which threats?

Where does trust change?

Who is acting?

How is identity established?

What is the actor allowed to do?

How are secrets protected?

How is sensitive data protected?

Which controls apply?

How do controls fail?

How is security tested?

What evidence proves the controls work?
```

These answers provide the foundation required for secure platform implementation.

---

## Success Criteria

The context and vision are successfully established when FamilyOS security can be understood as a coherent platform capability rather than a collection of independent features.

The intended security foundation is:

```text
Secure by Design
       +
Secure by Default
       +
Least Privilege
       +
Explicit Trust
       +
Protected Data
       +
Threat-Driven Controls
       +
Automated Validation
       +
Observable Decisions
       =
Trustworthy FamilyOS Security
```

---

## Conclusion

FamilyOS is designed to become a long-lived digital platform for families.

That mission requires security to exist at the architectural level.

The Security Framework therefore establishes security as a permanent engineering responsibility spanning design, implementation, validation, release, and runtime operation.

The governing vision is:

> FamilyOS security must protect family information and platform capabilities through explicit trust, minimal privilege, safe defaults, and verifiable controls.

EPIC-SEC-001 transforms that vision into a concrete architecture that the rest of the framework will define and prepare for implementation.
