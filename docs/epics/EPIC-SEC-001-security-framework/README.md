# Security Framework

## EPIC-SEC-001

### Overview

The **FamilyOS Security Framework** defines the canonical security foundation for FamilyOS engineering, plugins, data, identities, release processes, and future runtime operation.

It establishes security as a permanent engineering responsibility rather than a final validation activity performed after implementation.

The framework connects security concerns across the complete FamilyOS engineering lifecycle:

```text
Architecture
    ↓
Implementation
    ↓
Testing
    ↓
Quality
    ↓
Build
    ↓
Release
    ↓
Runtime Operation
    ↓
Observation
    ↓
Improvement
```

The Security Framework is defined by:

```text
EPIC-SEC-001
```

and maintained under:

```text
docs/epics/EPIC-SEC-001-security-framework/
```

---

## Purpose

The purpose of the Security Framework is to ensure that FamilyOS security remains:

* explicit;
* deny-by-default;
* least-privilege;
* threat-driven;
* evidence-based;
* data-protective;
* secret-safe;
* cryptographically sound;
* plugin-aware;
* observable;
* testable;
* automatable;
* governable;
* proportional to actual risk.

Security requirements apply throughout design, implementation, validation, release, and runtime operation.

---

## Core Principle

The central principle of the Security Framework is:

> FamilyOS security decisions must be explicit, least-privilege, evidence-based, threat-aware, and enforceable across every relevant trust boundary.

Security SHALL NOT depend exclusively on:

* implicit trust;
* naming conventions;
* developer memory;
* implementation location;
* undocumented assumptions;
* successful functional execution alone.

---

## Why the Security Framework Exists

FamilyOS may progressively manage:

* family identities;
* personal information;
* private documents;
* financial information;
* health-related information;
* communication data;
* plugins;
* external integrations;
* authentication credentials;
* cryptographic keys;
* release credentials;
* automation identities;
* infrastructure state.

Without a coherent security framework, individual components could independently define:

* authentication;
* authorization;
* permissions;
* secret handling;
* data protection;
* cryptography;
* threat handling;
* validation;
* release security.

This could create inconsistent guarantees and security gaps.

EPIC-SEC-001 provides a common security model.

---

## Security Responsibilities

The Security Framework governs:

```text
Security Principles
        ↓
Security Architecture
        ↓
Identity
        ↓
Authentication
        ↓
Authorization
        ↓
Data Protection
        ↓
Secrets
        ↓
Cryptography
        ↓
Threat and Risk
        ↓
Trust Boundaries
        ↓
Security Controls
        ↓
Compliance
        ↓
Implementation
        ↓
Automation
        ↓
Validation
        ↓
Release Security
```

---

## Security Principles

The framework establishes the following foundational security principles:

```text
Deny by Default
Least Privilege
Explicit Trust
Threat-Driven Security
Data Protection
Secret Safety
Cryptographic Soundness
Plugin-Aware Security
Security Observability
Testability
Automation
Vendor Neutrality
Proportionality
```

These principles guide architecture, implementation, testing, validation, and governance.

---

## Deny by Default

Access SHOULD be denied unless explicitly authorized.

The absence of an applicable allow rule SHALL NOT normally result in permission.

Preferred behavior:

```text
Unknown
   ↓
Untrusted
   ↓
Denied
```

until sufficient authorization evidence exists.

---

## Least Privilege

Users, services, plugins, automation, and operational identities SHOULD receive only the capabilities required for their legitimate responsibilities.

Privileges SHOULD remain:

* explicit;
* scoped;
* reviewable;
* revocable;
* traceable.

---

## Explicit Trust

Trust SHALL be established through explicit evidence.

Examples include:

* verified identity;
* valid authentication;
* approved permissions;
* trusted plugin provenance;
* signed artifacts;
* validated configuration;
* approved security exceptions.

Trust SHALL NOT automatically result from location or implementation origin.

---

## Security Architecture

The Security Architecture defines the structural organization of FamilyOS security.

A simplified flow is:

```text
Identity
   ↓
Authentication
   ↓
Authorization
   ↓
Policy Evaluation
   ↓
Domain Enforcement
   ↓
Capability / Data Access
   ↓
Security Evidence
```

Different boundaries may require different controls.

---

## Identity

Identity answers:

```text
Who or what is acting?
```

An identity may represent:

* a person;
* a family member;
* a service;
* a plugin;
* an automation process;
* a device;
* an operational actor;
* an external integration.

Identity SHALL remain separate from authorization.

---

## Authentication

Authentication establishes confidence in an asserted identity.

Authentication may use:

* passwords;
* tokens;
* certificates;
* device credentials;
* external identity providers;
* cryptographic proofs.

Successful authentication does not automatically imply unrestricted authorization.

---

## Authorization

Authorization determines whether an identified subject is permitted to perform an action.

Conceptually:

```text
Subject
   +
Action
   +
Resource
   +
Context
   ↓
Authorization Decision
```

Typical outcomes may include:

```text
ALLOW
DENY
REQUIRE_ADDITIONAL_ASSURANCE
```

---

## Permissions

Permissions SHOULD have stable and explicit semantics.

A permission should communicate the capability it governs.

Permissions may apply to:

* platform services;
* domain operations;
* plugins;
* APIs;
* data;
* automation;
* administration.

Permission meaning SHALL remain governed across component boundaries.

---

## Data Protection

FamilyOS data SHOULD be protected according to sensitivity and risk.

Protection may include:

* classification;
* minimization;
* access control;
* integrity controls;
* encryption;
* retention;
* deletion;
* auditability.

Security controls SHOULD remain proportional to actual data sensitivity.

---

## Secret Management

Secrets SHALL NOT be treated as ordinary configuration.

Examples include:

* passwords;
* API credentials;
* authentication tokens;
* private keys;
* encryption keys;
* signing keys;
* release credentials.

Secrets SHOULD be:

* isolated from source code;
* protected at rest;
* protected in transit;
* minimally distributed;
* revocable;
* rotated where appropriate;
* excluded from logs and release artifacts.

---

## Cryptography

Cryptographic mechanisms may protect:

* confidentiality;
* integrity;
* authenticity;
* signatures;
* credentials;
* release artifacts;
* provenance.

FamilyOS SHOULD use established cryptographic primitives and trusted implementations.

Custom cryptographic algorithms SHOULD NOT be introduced without exceptional justification.

---

## Threat Modeling

Threat modeling helps identify:

* protected assets;
* trust boundaries;
* threat actors;
* attack paths;
* misuse scenarios;
* assumptions;
* mitigations;
* residual risk.

A conceptual model is:

```text
Asset
  ↓
Threat
  ↓
Impact
  ↓
Likelihood
  ↓
Risk
  ↓
Control
  ↓
Residual Risk
```

Threat analysis SHOULD remain proportional to system criticality.

---

## Risk Management

Security risk influences:

* architecture;
* control selection;
* testing;
* validation;
* security review;
* release decisions;
* exceptions;
* operational monitoring.

Critical risks SHOULD normally block release or activation until remediated or explicitly governed.

---

## Trust Boundaries

Trust boundaries identify transitions where security assumptions change.

Examples include:

* user → application;
* plugin → platform;
* external system → FamilyOS;
* build environment → release environment;
* artifact → runtime;
* service → protected data.

Crossing a trust boundary SHOULD trigger appropriate validation and authorization.

---

## Security Controls

Security controls implement security requirements.

Controls may be:

```text
Preventive
Detective
Corrective
Compensating
```

A control SHOULD define:

* purpose;
* applicability;
* owner;
* implementation;
* evidence;
* validation method;
* lifecycle status.

---

## Security Compliance

Security compliance evaluates whether applicable security controls are satisfied.

Compliance may consume:

* security tests;
* policy checks;
* dependency scanning;
* configuration validation;
* secret scanning;
* security reviews;
* release evidence;
* runtime evidence.

Compliance SHALL NOT replace architectural security reasoning.

---

## Security Validation

Security validation verifies whether applicable requirements have been evaluated sufficiently.

Validation may occur at:

```text
Developer
    ↓
Pull Request
    ↓
Continuous Integration
    ↓
Build
    ↓
Release Candidate
    ↓
Release
    ↓
Runtime
```

Earlier validation SHOULD detect issues before privileged release operations.

---

## Validation Evidence

Security decisions SHOULD rely on trustworthy evidence.

Evidence may include:

* test results;
* security findings;
* dependency findings;
* policy validation;
* secret-scan results;
* artifact integrity;
* provenance;
* cryptographic validation;
* control assessments;
* release-gate results.

Missing required evidence SHALL NOT automatically become successful validation.

---

## Security Automation

Repeatable security controls SHOULD be automated where practical.

Automation may include:

* static validation;
* policy validation;
* secret scanning;
* dependency scanning;
* configuration checks;
* permission checks;
* artifact verification;
* release gates.

Automation SHALL NOT silently bypass unresolved findings.

---

## Plugin Security

Plugins are important FamilyOS trust boundaries.

Security considerations may include:

* plugin identity;
* capability declarations;
* permissions;
* provenance;
* dependencies;
* data access;
* isolation;
* runtime behavior;
* compliance.

Official plugin status SHALL NOT bypass mandatory security controls.

---

## Security and Testing

EPIC-TST-001 owns the general Testing Framework.

Security defines security-specific testing requirements such as:

* denied-operation tests;
* malformed-input tests;
* authorization tests;
* authentication tests;
* secret validation;
* plugin security tests;
* negative testing.

Security consumes the Testing Framework instead of defining a separate testing architecture.

---

## Security and Quality

EPIC-QLT-001 owns the general Quality Framework.

Security findings may become quality evidence.

Examples include:

* mandatory security gate results;
* risk findings;
* compliance findings;
* security test results;
* unresolved security defects.

---

## Security and Build

EPIC-BLD-001 owns the Build Framework.

Security integrates with Build through:

* dependency integrity;
* build environment trust;
* secret isolation;
* provenance;
* artifact integrity;
* supply-chain controls.

A successful build alone does not prove security readiness.

---

## Security and Release

EPIC-REL-001 owns the canonical Release Framework.

Security supplies security requirements and release gates.

Conceptually:

```text
Release Candidate
        ↓
Release Validation
        ↓
Security Validation
        ↓
Security Gate
        ↓
Release Authorization
        ↓
Publication
```

Security SHALL NOT introduce a competing release lifecycle.

---

## Security and Observability

EPIC-OBS-001 owns the Observability Framework.

Security may consume observability capabilities for:

* security event detection;
* investigation;
* anomaly detection;
* runtime control verification;
* compliance evidence;
* incident analysis.

Observability data SHALL itself respect security and privacy requirements.

---

## Security and Plugin Compliance

EPIC-PLUGIN-002 owns Plugin Compliance.

Security defines security requirements that may become plugin compliance rules.

Plugin Compliance may provide structured evidence that a plugin conforms to required security expectations.

---

## Canonical Numbered Documents

The historical Security Framework consists of exactly ten numbered documents:

```text
00-EPIC.md
01-Context-and-Vision.md
02-Security-Principles.md
03-Security-Architecture.md
04-Identity-Authentication-and-Authorization.md
05-Data-Secrets-and-Cryptography.md
06-Threat-Risk-and-Trust-Model.md
07-Security-Controls-and-Compliance.md
08-Implementation-and-Automation.md
09-Validation-and-Release.md
```

Canonical numbered range:

```text
00 → 09
```

Numbered document count:

```text
10
```

---

## Control Documents

The normalized current repository representation adds seven control documents:

```text
EPIC-SEC-001.md
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

Control document count:

```text
7
```

---

## Current Canonical Repository Structure

The normalized structure is:

```text
10 numbered documents
+
7 control documents
=
17 canonical files
```

Canonical structure:

```text
Canonical Range:       00 → 09
Numbered Documents:    10
Control Documents:      7
Canonical Files:       17
```

---

## Historical Structure

The historical publication used the earlier compact documentation model.

Historical structure:

```text
Numbered Documents: 10
Control Documents:    0
Historical Files:    10
```

This historical fact SHALL remain explicit.

The seven control documents added later SHALL NOT be represented as having existed at publication time.

---

## Historical Publication

Framework version:

```text
5.0.0
```

Historical tag:

```text
v5.0.0-security-framework
```

Historical publication commit:

```text
498fa16e692bf1461df2e4afba8bc4e485837a45
```

Historical publication status:

```text
Published
```

Historical tag policy:

```text
Immutable
```

---

## Post-Release Normalization

The current repository activity introduces the standard FamilyOS EPIC control-document layer.

Normalization adds:

* machine-readable metadata;
* repository inventory;
* validation evidence;
* revision history;
* changelog;
* navigation;
* explicit post-release lifecycle state.

Normalization does not redefine the framework's historical release.

---

## Revalidation

The normalized representation must be revalidated before its current control state may be considered fully validated.

Required validation includes:

* YAML parsing;
* canonical inventory;
* numbering integrity;
* control document integrity;
* empty-file validation;
* manifest synchronization;
* reference integrity;
* active-state consistency;
* historical publication integrity;
* historical tag verification;
* security semantic consistency;
* Ruff;
* MyPy;
* Pytest;
* repository diff validation.

---

## Evidence Policy

Validation SHALL follow:

```text
Execute
    ↓
Observe
    ↓
Evaluate
    ↓
Record
```

A requirement SHALL NOT be marked PASS merely because it is documented.

Only actual validation evidence may establish successful revalidation.

---

---

## Final Principle

The FamilyOS Security Framework is based on the following principle:

> Security must remain explicit, least-privilege, threat-aware, evidence-based, testable, and enforceable from architecture through release and continued operation.

Historical publication is preserved exactly as it occurred.

Current governance normalization adds control and evidence around that historical framework without rewriting its release identity.
