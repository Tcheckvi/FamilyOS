# Security Framework

## EPIC-SEC-001

### Security Principles

### Overview

This document defines the core security principles governing FamilyOS.

These principles establish the rules that guide security architecture, implementation, testing, validation, plugin behavior, runtime operation, and future automation.

They are intended to remain stable even as specific technologies, providers, cryptographic mechanisms, and deployment environments evolve.

The objective is to make security behavior predictable across the entire FamilyOS ecosystem.

---

## Principle 1 — Secure by Design

Security SHOULD be considered during architecture and design, not added only after implementation.

Every significant component should identify:

* protected resources;
* relevant actors;
* trust boundaries;
* required permissions;
* expected failure behavior;
* security evidence.

Security responsibilities should be visible in architecture rather than hidden inside implementation details.

---

## Principle 2 — Secure by Default

FamilyOS SHOULD choose secure behavior when configuration is absent or incomplete.

Examples include:

```text
Missing authorization
        ↓
       Deny
```

```text
External integration
        ↓
Disabled until configured
```

```text
Unsafe diagnostic mode
        ↓
Disabled by default
```

Secure operation should not require users or developers to discover undocumented hardening steps.

---

## Principle 3 — Deny by Default

Protected operations MUST NOT be allowed unless authorization requirements are satisfied.

The default decision is:

```text
NOT EXPLICITLY ALLOWED
        ↓
       DENIED
```

This principle applies especially to:

* protected capabilities;
* administrative operations;
* sensitive repositories;
* secrets;
* security configuration;
* plugin permissions.

Unknown or incomplete authorization state must not silently become permission.

---

## Principle 4 — Least Privilege

Actors and components SHOULD receive only the privileges required for their intended responsibilities.

Privileges should be:

```text
Minimal
Scoped
Explicit
Reviewable
Revocable
```

Broad platform access should be avoided when narrower permissions can satisfy the requirement.

---

## Principle 5 — Explicit Trust

Trust must be explicit.

FamilyOS MUST NOT assume that a component is trustworthy simply because it is:

* internal;
* official;
* local;
* authenticated;
* installed;
* configured.

Trust should derive from defined architectural relationships and validated controls.

---

## Principle 6 — Internal Does Not Mean Trusted

Internal components may still be:

* defective;
* compromised;
* misconfigured;
* over-privileged;
* supplied by unsafe dependencies.

FamilyOS therefore treats internal boundaries as meaningful security boundaries where appropriate.

```text
Internal
   ≠
Automatically Trusted
```

---

## Principle 7 — Authenticate Before Trusting Identity

Security-sensitive identity claims MUST be established through appropriate authentication before they are trusted.

An asserted identity is not equivalent to an authenticated identity.

Conceptually:

```text
Identity Claim
      ↓
Authentication
      ↓
Verified Identity
```

The strength of authentication should remain proportional to the protected operation.

---

## Principle 8 — Authentication and Authorization Are Separate

Authentication establishes identity.

Authorization determines permitted behavior.

These concerns MUST remain distinct.

```text
Authentication
      ↓
Who is acting?
```

```text
Authorization
      ↓
What may they do?
```

Successful authentication never implies unrestricted authorization.

---

## Principle 9 — Authorization Is Explicit

Security-sensitive operations SHOULD state their authorization requirements clearly.

Authorization logic should not depend on hidden assumptions.

A protected capability should make it possible to determine:

```text
Actor
  +
Operation
  +
Resource
  +
Required Permission
  =
Authorization Decision
```

---

## Principle 10 — Capabilities Are Security-Relevant Boundaries

FamilyOS capabilities represent meaningful operations.

Where appropriate, security enforcement SHOULD occur at capability boundaries.

This creates a model such as:

```text
Actor
   ↓
Security Context
   ↓
Authorization
   ↓
Capability
   ↓
Domain Operation
```

This prevents security logic from being fragmented across arbitrary low-level implementation details.

---

## Principle 11 — Security Context Is Explicit

Security-sensitive execution SHOULD use an explicit security context where required.

A conceptual context may contain:

```text
actor
authentication_state
permissions
roles
security_attributes
```

The security context must not become unrestricted domain state.

It exists to carry security-relevant execution information.

---

## Principle 12 — Trust Boundaries Are Identified

Every significant transition between different trust levels SHOULD be identifiable.

Examples include:

* user to application;
* application to plugin;
* plugin to platform;
* application to repository;
* FamilyOS to external integration;
* component to secret provider;
* runtime to persisted storage.

Security decisions are strongest when trust transitions are visible.

---

## Principle 13 — Inputs Are Untrusted

Input crossing a trust boundary MUST be treated as untrusted until validated.

Validation may include:

* structure;
* type;
* length;
* allowed values;
* syntax;
* semantics;
* authorization context.

Validation should occur near the relevant trust boundary.

---

## Principle 14 — Validation Is Not Authorization

Valid input is not automatically authorized input.

For example:

```text
Valid document identifier
        ≠
Permission to access document
```

Input validation and authorization solve different security problems and MUST NOT be substituted for one another.

---

## Principle 15 — Outputs Are Security-Relevant

Security applies to outputs as well as inputs.

FamilyOS SHOULD ensure that:

* responses do not expose unauthorized data;
* logs do not expose secrets;
* diagnostics do not expose excessive internal state;
* errors do not reveal unnecessary security details;
* exports respect authorization.

Output protection is part of the trust boundary.

---

## Principle 16 — Data Is Protected Throughout Its Lifecycle

FamilyOS SHOULD protect sensitive data through applicable lifecycle stages:

```text
Creation
   ↓
Processing
   ↓
Storage
   ↓
Transmission
   ↓
Backup
   ↓
Archive
   ↓
Deletion
```

Security responsibility does not end when data reaches persistent storage.

---

## Principle 17 — Data Protection Is Proportional

Not all information requires identical security controls.

Security controls SHOULD reflect:

* sensitivity;
* ownership;
* exposure;
* impact;
* lifecycle;
* trust context.

More sensitive information justifies stronger controls.

---

## Principle 18 — Data Minimization Reduces Risk

FamilyOS SHOULD process, propagate, store, and expose only the information required for an operation.

Unnecessary data increases:

* attack surface;
* privacy exposure;
* storage risk;
* observability risk;
* integration risk.

Data minimization is therefore both a privacy and security control.

---

## Principle 19 — Secrets Are Not Configuration

Secrets MUST NOT be treated like ordinary configuration values.

Examples include:

* passwords;
* API keys;
* tokens;
* signing keys;
* encryption keys;
* private keys;
* recovery secrets.

Secrets require stronger lifecycle and access controls.

---

## Principle 20 — Secrets Are Never Committed

Secrets MUST NOT be committed to source control.

This rule applies regardless of environment.

```text
Development
Testing
Staging
Production
```

all follow the same principle.

Test suites should use synthetic secrets.

---

## Principle 21 — Secrets Are Accessed Through Controlled Interfaces

Components SHOULD retrieve secrets through dedicated security abstractions.

Conceptually:

```text
Component
   ↓
Secret Contract
   ↓
Secret Provider
```

Components should not need to know where secrets are physically stored.

---

## Principle 22 — Secret Exposure Is Minimized

Secrets SHOULD only be available:

* to components that require them;
* for the minimum necessary scope;
* for the minimum practical duration.

Secrets SHOULD NOT be copied unnecessarily across process or component boundaries.

---

## Principle 23 — Cryptography Uses Established Implementations

FamilyOS MUST NOT invent custom cryptographic algorithms.

Cryptographic mechanisms SHOULD rely on established, reviewed libraries and standards.

Custom cryptography introduces unnecessary risk.

---

## Principle 24 — Cryptography Has a Defined Purpose

Cryptography SHOULD be used only for clearly identified security objectives.

Examples include:

```text
Encryption
      → Confidentiality

Digital Signature
      → Authenticity / Integrity

Hash
      → Integrity / Identification

Key Derivation
      → Controlled Key Generation
```

Using cryptography without a clear purpose creates false security.

---

## Principle 25 — Cryptographic Agility

FamilyOS SHOULD avoid unnecessary dependence on one specific cryptographic algorithm or provider.

The preferred architecture is:

```text
FamilyOS Security Contract
        ↓
Cryptographic Adapter
        ↓
Approved Implementation
```

This allows cryptographic mechanisms to evolve over the lifetime of FamilyOS.

---

## Principle 26 — Keys Have a Lifecycle

Cryptographic keys require explicit lifecycle thinking.

A complete key lifecycle may include:

```text
Generation
   ↓
Storage
   ↓
Use
   ↓
Rotation
   ↓
Revocation
   ↓
Deletion
```

EPIC-SEC-001 establishes the architectural requirement even if the initial implementation remains minimal.

---

## Principle 27 — Fail Securely

When security controls cannot determine a safe result, FamilyOS SHOULD choose the safer outcome.

For example:

```text
Authorization service unavailable
        ↓
Protected operation denied
```

Security-critical failure should not silently downgrade protection.

---

## Principle 28 — Security Failure Must Be Diagnosable

Failing securely must not mean failing invisibly.

Security failures SHOULD generate safe diagnostic evidence.

Examples include:

```text
authorization denied
authentication failed
security configuration invalid
secret unavailable
integrity validation failed
```

Evidence must remain safe and avoid leaking sensitive details.

---

## Principle 29 — Error Messages Do Not Reveal Excessive Detail

Errors visible outside trusted engineering boundaries SHOULD avoid exposing:

* credentials;
* secret values;
* internal topology;
* sensitive identifiers;
* private data;
* implementation details useful to an attacker.

Internal diagnostic channels may contain more information when appropriately controlled.

---

## Principle 30 — Security Decisions Are Explainable

Important security decisions SHOULD provide stable reason categories where practical.

For example:

```text
DENIED
reason = MISSING_PERMISSION
```

is preferable to an unexplained:

```text
False
```

Explainable security improves:

* testing;
* debugging;
* observability;
* governance;
* user experience.

---

## Principle 31 — Security Is Observable

Important security events SHOULD produce structured runtime evidence.

Examples may include:

```text
authentication.failed
authorization.denied
security.configuration.invalid
plugin.permission.denied
integrity.validation.failed
```

Security observability must respect the Observability Framework.

---

## Principle 32 — Observability Must Not Weaken Security

Security telemetry MUST NOT become a mechanism for exposing protected information.

Secrets, credentials, cryptographic material, and private family content MUST NOT be intentionally emitted.

The rule remains:

> Observe the security decision, not the protected secret or content.

---

## Principle 33 — Security Events Are Structured

Security-relevant runtime evidence SHOULD use structured events where practical.

A conceptual security event may contain:

```text
event_name
timestamp
component
actor_context
operation
security_outcome
reason_category
correlation_id
```

Structured security events enable reliable testing and future automation.

---

## Principle 34 — Security Controls Are Layered

FamilyOS follows defense-in-depth principles.

Critical protections SHOULD NOT depend on one control alone.

Conceptually:

```text
Authentication
      ↓
Authorization
      ↓
Validation
      ↓
Capability Boundary
      ↓
Repository Controls
      ↓
Data Protection
      ↓
Observability
```

Failure of one layer should not automatically compromise all protections.

---

## Principle 35 — Security Controls Are Proportional

Defense in depth does not mean maximum complexity everywhere.

Controls SHOULD reflect:

* threat likelihood;
* impact;
* sensitivity;
* exposure;
* operational cost.

Security that is impossible to maintain can become insecure.

---

## Principle 36 — Threats Drive Controls

FamilyOS SHOULD introduce controls because they mitigate identifiable threats.

The preferred model is:

```text
Threat
  ↓
Risk
  ↓
Control
  ↓
Validation
```

The inverse model should be avoided:

```text
Tool
  ↓
Find somewhere to use it
```

---

## Principle 37 — Risks Are Explicit

Important security risks SHOULD be recorded and evaluated.

A simple conceptual model is:

```text
Likelihood
    ×
Impact
    =
Risk
```

The exact scoring method may remain lightweight.

The purpose is consistent decision-making.

---

## Principle 38 — Risk Cannot Be Eliminated Completely

Security engineering manages risk.

It cannot guarantee absolute absence of vulnerability.

FamilyOS should therefore support decisions such as:

```text
Mitigate
Avoid
Transfer
Accept
```

Risk acceptance must be explicit when it concerns significant security exposure.

---

## Principle 39 — Security Is Testable

Security requirements SHOULD be expressed in ways that automated tests can verify.

Examples include:

* authorized operation succeeds;
* unauthorized operation fails;
* invalid input is rejected;
* secrets are absent from telemetry;
* plugin permissions are enforced;
* security configuration is validated.

Security that cannot be tested is harder to trust.

---

## Principle 40 — Negative Tests Are Essential

Security testing must verify denied and invalid behavior, not only successful paths.

For example:

```text
Authorized Actor
      → allowed
```

and:

```text
Unauthorized Actor
      → denied
```

Both are required evidence.

---

## Principle 41 — Security Regression Is Prevented

Once a security invariant is established, automated tests SHOULD protect it against regression.

For example, a test demonstrating that a plugin cannot access an unauthorized capability should remain part of the suite.

---

## Principle 42 — Security Validation Is Automated Where Practical

Repeated manual security checks SHOULD be automated when reliable automation is possible.

Potential automation includes:

* secret detection;
* dependency checks;
* authorization tests;
* configuration validation;
* plugin compliance;
* release gates.

Automation reduces dependence on memory and process discipline.

---

## Principle 43 — Tooling Must Provide Clear Value

FamilyOS SHOULD NOT continuously accumulate security tools without justification.

Every security tool should answer questions such as:

```text
What risk does it reduce?

What evidence does it produce?

How is it integrated?

Who maintains it?

Does an existing tool already provide this capability?
```

Tooling complexity itself creates operational risk.

---

## Principle 44 — Plugins Follow Platform Security

Plugins MUST NOT create independent security architectures that bypass platform rules.

Plugins SHOULD use FamilyOS security contracts for applicable concerns such as:

* authorization;
* permissions;
* secrets;
* security events;
* validation.

---

## Principle 45 — Official Plugins Are Not Exempt

Official plugins remain subject to platform security controls.

Official status may affect trust policy but must not automatically grant unrestricted access.

```text
Official
   ≠
Unrestricted
```

---

## Principle 46 — Third-Party Plugins Require Stronger Boundaries

Third-party plugins SHOULD be treated as stronger trust boundaries.

Applicable controls may include:

* declared capabilities;
* declared permissions;
* validation;
* compliance checks;
* dependency review;
* restricted platform interfaces.

Controls should evolve according to actual plugin risk.

---

## Principle 47 — Plugin Permissions Are Explicit

A plugin requiring protected operations SHOULD declare or obtain explicit permissions.

Conceptually:

```text
Plugin
  ↓
Capability Requirement
  ↓
Permission Requirement
  ↓
Authorization
  ↓
Execution
```

Hidden privilege acquisition should be avoided.

---

## Principle 48 — Integrations Are External Trust Boundaries

External integrations MUST be treated as external systems regardless of how trusted their operator may appear.

FamilyOS SHOULD validate:

* identity;
* credentials;
* transport;
* input;
* output;
* permissions;
* failure behavior.

---

## Principle 49 — External Data Is Untrusted

Information received from external integrations MUST be validated before it is trusted.

A successful network connection does not establish semantic trust in the received data.

---

## Principle 50 — External Credentials Are Protected

Integration credentials MUST follow the same secret-protection principles as other credentials.

They SHOULD NOT be:

* embedded in code;
* committed to Git;
* logged;
* exposed through diagnostics.

---

## Principle 51 — Configuration Is Security-Relevant

Configuration can change security behavior.

Security-sensitive configuration MUST therefore be validated.

Examples include:

* authentication settings;
* authorization policies;
* plugin permissions;
* cryptographic configuration;
* secret-provider configuration;
* external integration security settings.

---

## Principle 52 — Invalid Security Configuration Fails Clearly

FamilyOS SHOULD reject invalid security configuration rather than silently falling back to insecure behavior.

Conceptually:

```text
Invalid Security Configuration
          ↓
      Explicit Failure
```

not:

```text
Invalid Security Configuration
          ↓
    Security Disabled
```

---

## Principle 53 — Security Defaults Cannot Be Disabled Accidentally

Mandatory security invariants must remain active regardless of normal verbosity or convenience settings.

For example:

```text
DEBUG = true
```

must never imply:

```text
Authorization disabled
Secrets logged
Validation bypassed
```

---

## Principle 54 — Dependencies Are Part of the Attack Surface

External packages, libraries, and build tools contribute to FamilyOS security risk.

Dependency decisions SHOULD consider:

* necessity;
* maintenance;
* provenance;
* vulnerabilities;
* version control;
* transitive dependencies.

Every unnecessary dependency increases attack surface.

---

## Principle 55 — Supply-Chain Security Is Shared

Security across:

```text
Source
   ↓
Dependency Resolution
   ↓
Build
   ↓
Artifact
   ↓
Release
```

is shared between the Security, Build, Quality, and Release frameworks.

EPIC-SEC-001 does not duplicate those frameworks.

It defines the security expectations applied to their outputs.

---

## Principle 56 — Build Artifacts Must Be Trustworthy

Artifacts used for release SHOULD be traceable to the approved source and build process.

Where stronger integrity guarantees become necessary, FamilyOS may introduce additional artifact verification.

---

## Principle 57 — Security Evidence Is Trustworthy

Security evidence used for release decisions, compliance, or incident investigation SHOULD accurately reflect what occurred.

FamilyOS SHOULD avoid:

* fabricated security outcomes;
* silent validation bypasses;
* incomplete security test reporting;
* misleading success states.

---

## Principle 58 — Security and Privacy Reinforce Each Other

Security controls SHOULD support FamilyOS privacy objectives.

Practices such as:

* least privilege;
* data minimization;
* access control;
* safe observability;
* secret isolation;

reduce both privacy exposure and security risk.

---

## Principle 59 — Security Must Respect Domain Boundaries

Security infrastructure should not unnecessarily pollute domain models.

Domain code may express security requirements while remaining independent from specific authentication technologies or external security providers.

This preserves FamilyOS architecture.

---

## Principle 60 — Security Providers Are Replaceable

Core FamilyOS security contracts SHOULD remain vendor-neutral.

The preferred pattern is:

```text
FamilyOS Component
       ↓
Security Contract
       ↓
Adapter
       ↓
Security Provider
```

External vendors remain implementation details.

---

## Principle 61 — Local Development Remains Possible

Security architecture SHOULD support safe local development without requiring enterprise infrastructure.

For example:

```text
Authorization Contract
       ↓
Deterministic Local Provider
```

or:

```text
Secret Contract
       ↓
Local Development Provider
```

Local simplicity must not require disabling core security invariants.

---

## Principle 62 — Tests Use Synthetic Security Data

Tests SHOULD NOT require real credentials or real family information.

Security fixtures should use:

* synthetic identities;
* synthetic secrets;
* deterministic permissions;
* isolated repositories.

This prevents test infrastructure from becoming a security liability.

---

## Principle 63 — Security Performance Is Proportional

Security controls introduce execution cost.

FamilyOS SHOULD avoid unnecessary overhead while never sacrificing required protection solely for convenience.

Performance optimization must be based on evidence rather than assumptions.

---

## Principle 64 — Security Complexity Is Minimized

Every additional security abstraction introduces maintenance responsibility.

FamilyOS SHOULD prefer the smallest architecture that satisfies identified threats and requirements.

Simple security that is consistently enforced is preferable to complex security that developers bypass.

---

## Principle 65 — Security APIs Are Predictable

Security APIs SHOULD remain:

```text
Small
Explicit
Typed
Deterministic
Testable
```

Unexpected implicit security behavior should be avoided.

---

## Principle 66 — Security Policy Is Separated From Mechanism

Where practical, FamilyOS SHOULD separate:

```text
Policy
   → What is allowed?
```

from:

```text
Mechanism
   → How is the decision enforced?
```

This makes policies easier to evolve without replacing the entire enforcement architecture.

---

## Principle 67 — Permissions Have Stable Meaning

Permissions SHOULD represent stable security concepts.

A permission must not silently change meaning between components or versions.

Examples may include conceptual permissions such as:

```text
document.read
document.write
communication.send
plugin.configure
```

Actual permission design is defined by the authorization architecture.

---

## Principle 68 — Permissions Should Be Composable

FamilyOS SHOULD support permission composition without forcing every authorization rule into independent special cases.

Roles or policies MAY group permissions where useful.

The underlying permission semantics should remain explicit.

---

## Principle 69 — Roles Are Not the Security Model

Roles may simplify policy management.

However:

```text
Role
   ≠
Authorization Architecture
```

Authorization should ultimately resolve to explicit access decisions.

This allows future policy evolution beyond simple role-based control.

---

## Principle 70 — Security State Is Not Global Mutable State

Security contexts SHOULD NOT depend on uncontrolled global mutable variables.

Execution-specific security state should remain scoped and predictable.

This improves:

* testability;
* concurrency;
* isolation;
* reasoning.

---

## Principle 71 — Security Decisions Are Deterministic

Given equivalent security inputs and policy state, authorization decisions SHOULD produce equivalent results.

Unpredictable security behavior is difficult to validate.

---

## Principle 72 — Security Boundaries Are Tested Directly

Tests SHOULD target security boundaries explicitly.

Examples include:

```text
application → plugin
plugin → capability
capability → repository
FamilyOS → external integration
```

Testing only internal helper functions is insufficient for validating actual trust boundaries.

---

## Principle 73 — Security Controls Have Owners

Important security controls SHOULD have identifiable architectural ownership.

Ownership includes responsibility for:

* meaning;
* implementation;
* validation;
* evolution;
* deprecation.

Controls without ownership tend to become inconsistent.

---

## Principle 74 — Security Changes Are Reviewed Proportionally

Changes affecting:

* authentication;
* authorization;
* secret handling;
* cryptography;
* trust boundaries;
* plugin permissions;

SHOULD receive stronger review than low-risk unrelated changes.

The process should remain proportional and practical.

---

## Principle 75 — Security Contracts Evolve Deliberately

Stable security contracts SHOULD distinguish:

```text
Additive Change
Compatible Change
Deprecation
Breaking Change
```

Breaking security behavior must not be introduced silently.

---

## Principle 76 — Deprecated Security Behavior Is Removed

Unsafe legacy security behavior should not remain indefinitely merely for compatibility.

When security and compatibility conflict, FamilyOS should explicitly assess the risk and migration path.

---

## Principle 77 — Security Automation Consumes Contracts

Automation SHOULD operate on structured security contracts rather than fragile human-readable output.

Examples include:

* authorization results;
* security events;
* validation results;
* plugin permission metadata;
* dependency findings.

---

## Principle 78 — Security Gates Are Risk-Based

Security findings should not all produce identical lifecycle consequences.

Conceptually:

```text
Low Risk
   → record / improve

Medium Risk
   → review / remediate

High Risk
   → block where appropriate

Critical Risk
   → mandatory block
```

Exact severity policy is defined by governance and risk management.

---

## Principle 79 — Security Warnings Must Remain Actionable

Persistent warnings without clear action reduce trust in security tooling.

FamilyOS SHOULD avoid security noise that developers learn to ignore.

---

## Principle 80 — Security Is Continuous

Security is not complete when a release is produced.

Security spans:

```text
Architecture
    ↓
Implementation
    ↓
Testing
    ↓
Build
    ↓
Release
    ↓
Runtime
    ↓
Operations
```

Each stage contributes different security evidence.

---

## Decision Hierarchy

When security concerns conflict with convenience or implementation simplicity, FamilyOS SHOULD prioritize:

```text
Protection of Family Information
          ↓
Security Invariants
          ↓
Functional Correctness
          ↓
Evidence Trustworthiness
          ↓
Availability
          ↓
Performance
          ↓
Developer Convenience
```

This hierarchy is not intended to justify unnecessary complexity.

It establishes which properties take priority when genuine conflicts exist.

---

## Practical Security Design Test

Before introducing a security mechanism, engineers SHOULD be able to answer:

1. What asset is being protected?
2. Who or what can interact with it?
3. Where is the trust boundary?
4. What threat is being mitigated?
5. What authorization rule applies?
6. What happens when the control fails?
7. What evidence demonstrates the control works?
8. Can the control be tested automatically?
9. Does the control expose sensitive information?
10. Is the complexity proportional to the risk?

If these questions cannot be answered, the proposed security mechanism may not be sufficiently understood.

---

## Principle Summary

The FamilyOS Security Framework can be summarized as:

```text
Secure by Design
Secure by Default
Deny by Default
Least Privilege
Explicit Trust
Validated Inputs
Protected Outputs
Protected Data
Protected Secrets
Standard Cryptography
Threat-Driven Controls
Defense in Depth
Safe Failure
Explainable Decisions
Observable Security
Testable Security
Automated Validation
Plugin-Aware Security
Vendor Neutrality
Minimal Complexity
```

---

## Conclusion

FamilyOS security exists to protect family information, platform capabilities, and system trust without creating unnecessary complexity.

The governing principle is:

> Security must be explicit at trust boundaries, minimal in privilege, safe by default, and verifiable through evidence.

These principles establish the constraints under which the FamilyOS Security Architecture will be designed and implemented.
