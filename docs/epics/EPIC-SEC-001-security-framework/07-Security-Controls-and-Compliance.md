# Security Framework

## EPIC-SEC-001

## 07 Security Controls and Compliance

### Overview

Security controls and compliance provide the mechanism through which FamilyOS security requirements become verifiable, enforceable, measurable, and auditable.

Security controls define the safeguards used to reduce security risk.

Compliance determines whether those safeguards are implemented, operating as intended, and supported by sufficient evidence.

Within FamilyOS, compliance MUST NOT be treated as a documentation-only activity.

Security compliance is an engineering capability that connects:

* architecture;
* implementation;
* policies;
* testing;
* observability;
* evidence;
* governance;
* release decisions;
* continuous improvement.

A control is valuable only when its objective is clear, its implementation can be verified, and its effectiveness can be demonstrated.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to establish the FamilyOS model for:

* security controls;
* control objectives;
* control ownership;
* preventive controls;
* detective controls;
* corrective controls;
* compensating controls;
* technical controls;
* administrative controls;
* operational controls;
* compliance requirements;
* compliance profiles;
* evidence collection;
* security findings;
* control testing;
* exception management;
* security attestations;
* compliance reporting;
* release security gates;
* continuous compliance.

The objective is to create a security assurance model that remains practical, traceable, and compatible with FamilyOS engineering workflows.

---

## Security Control Objectives

FamilyOS security controls MUST support objectives including:

1. prevent unauthorized access;
2. protect sensitive information;
3. preserve system integrity;
4. reduce attack surface;
5. detect suspicious or unauthorized activity;
6. contain security failures;
7. support secure recovery;
8. protect software supply chains;
9. enforce secure engineering practices;
10. preserve auditable security evidence;
11. support risk-based decision-making;
12. demonstrate compliance with FamilyOS security requirements.

Controls SHOULD be selected based on risk rather than implemented without a defined security purpose.

---

## Security Control Model

A FamilyOS security control SHOULD define:

```text
Control Identifier
        │
        ▼
Control Objective
        │
        ▼
Security Requirement
        │
        ▼
Implementation
        │
        ▼
Validation Method
        │
        ▼
Evidence
        │
        ▼
Compliance Status
```

Each important control SHOULD be traceable from requirement to evidence.

---

## Control Identifier

Security controls SHOULD use stable identifiers.

A possible FamilyOS convention is:

```text
SEC-CTRL-IDENTITY-001
SEC-CTRL-DATA-001
SEC-CTRL-CRYPTO-001
SEC-CTRL-PLUGIN-001
SEC-CTRL-BUILD-001
SEC-CTRL-RELEASE-001
```

Identifiers SHOULD remain stable across revisions whenever the control objective remains materially unchanged.

Stable identifiers enable:

* traceability;
* reporting;
* automation;
* audit;
* exception management;
* historical comparison.

---

## Control Definition

Each security control SHOULD define at minimum:

* identifier;
* title;
* objective;
* requirement;
* scope;
* owner;
* implementation expectations;
* validation method;
* evidence requirements;
* severity if violated;
* lifecycle status.

Controls MAY additionally define:

* applicable environments;
* related threats;
* related risks;
* dependencies;
* automation level;
* review frequency;
* exceptions.

---

## Control Objective

The control objective explains the security outcome that the control is intended to achieve.

For example:

```text
Objective:
Prevent unauthorized access to privileged FamilyOS capabilities.
```

The objective SHOULD describe the intended protection rather than a particular technical implementation.

This allows implementation mechanisms to evolve without changing the fundamental control purpose.

---

## Control Requirement

The control requirement defines the mandatory or recommended behavior required to satisfy the objective.

Example:

```text
Privileged operations MUST require explicit authorization
before execution.
```

Control requirements SHOULD use normative language consistently.

FamilyOS SHOULD use:

* MUST;
* MUST NOT;
* SHOULD;
* SHOULD NOT;
* MAY.

---

## Control Scope

Every control MUST have a defined scope.

Scope MAY include:

* entire platform;
* specific domain;
* plugin runtime;
* official plugins;
* third-party plugins;
* infrastructure;
* CI/CD;
* production;
* development environments;
* release pipeline;
* particular data classifications.

Ambiguous scope SHOULD be avoided.

---

## Control Ownership

Every significant security control SHOULD have defined ownership.

The owner is responsible for ensuring that:

* the control remains documented;
* implementation exists;
* evidence remains available;
* failures are addressed;
* exceptions are reviewed.

Ownership MAY belong to:

* platform security;
* domain team;
* plugin owner;
* infrastructure owner;
* release owner;
* engineering governance.

Control ownership does not eliminate shared security responsibility.

---

## Control Categories

FamilyOS SHOULD classify controls by purpose.

Primary categories include:

```text
Preventive Controls
Detective Controls
Corrective Controls
Recovery Controls
Compensating Controls
```

A mature security architecture generally uses multiple control categories together.

---

## Preventive Controls

Preventive controls attempt to stop security violations before they occur.

Examples include:

* authentication;
* authorization;
* least privilege;
* encryption;
* input validation;
* network restrictions;
* secure configuration;
* dependency restrictions;
* plugin permission enforcement.

Preventive controls SHOULD be preferred where reliable prevention is possible.

---

## Detective Controls

Detective controls identify security-relevant activity that prevention mechanisms did not stop or could not prevent.

Examples include:

* security logging;
* audit monitoring;
* intrusion detection;
* integrity verification;
* secret scanning;
* vulnerability scanning;
* abnormal-access detection.

Detection SHOULD produce actionable evidence.

---

## Corrective Controls

Corrective controls reduce impact after a security issue has been identified.

Examples include:

* credential rotation;
* permission revocation;
* configuration repair;
* patch deployment;
* compromised plugin disablement;
* dependency remediation.

Corrective controls SHOULD have clearly defined triggering conditions.

---

## Recovery Controls

Recovery controls restore trusted system operation after security failure.

Examples include:

* secure backup restoration;
* key recovery;
* configuration rollback;
* infrastructure reconstruction;
* trusted artifact redeployment.

Recovery MUST restore security guarantees, not merely service availability.

---

## Compensating Controls

A compensating control MAY be used when a primary control cannot be implemented immediately or completely.

A compensating control MUST:

* address the same or comparable risk;
* be documented;
* have defined ownership;
* be validated;
* have an expiration or review condition.

Compensating controls MUST NOT become permanent undocumented substitutes for required controls.

---

## Control Implementation Categories

Security controls MAY also be classified by implementation type.

```text
Technical
Administrative
Operational
Physical
```

FamilyOS primarily defines technical, administrative, and operational controls within the software engineering context.

---

## Technical Controls

Technical controls are enforced through software, infrastructure, or automated mechanisms.

Examples include:

* encryption;
* access control;
* authentication;
* network segmentation;
* secret management;
* static analysis;
* runtime restrictions;
* automated policy checks.

Technical controls SHOULD be automated where reliable automation is possible.

---

## Administrative Controls

Administrative controls govern responsibilities, decisions, and security processes.

Examples include:

* security policies;
* access review requirements;
* architecture approval;
* exception approval;
* security training requirements;
* governance procedures.

Administrative controls SHOULD be supported by technical enforcement where practical.

---

## Operational Controls

Operational controls govern recurring security activities.

Examples include:

* key rotation;
* credential review;
* vulnerability remediation;
* incident response;
* backup validation;
* release verification;
* security monitoring.

Operational controls SHOULD have defined frequency or event triggers when applicable.

---

## Control Layers

Security controls SHOULD be distributed across architecture layers.

```text
Governance
    │
    ▼
Identity and Access
    │
    ▼
Application
    │
    ▼
Domain
    │
    ▼
Plugins
    │
    ▼
Data and Cryptography
    │
    ▼
Infrastructure
    │
    ▼
Build and Release
    │
    ▼
Observability
```

Critical risks SHOULD NOT rely exclusively on one control layer.

---

## Defense-in-Depth Controls

Multiple controls MAY protect the same security objective.

Example:

```text
Sensitive Resource
       │
       ├── Authentication
       ├── Authorization
       ├── Domain Validation
       ├── Storage Permission
       ├── Encryption
       └── Audit Logging
```

Failure of one mechanism SHOULD NOT automatically result in complete loss of protection.

---

## Baseline Security Controls

FamilyOS SHOULD maintain a baseline set of controls applicable to all relevant platform components.

The baseline SHOULD include controls for:

* authentication;
* authorization;
* least privilege;
* secrets;
* cryptography;
* sensitive data;
* secure configuration;
* dependencies;
* logging;
* vulnerability management;
* secure build;
* secure release;
* recovery.

Components MAY require additional controls based on risk.

---

## Risk-Based Controls

Security controls SHOULD be proportional to risk.

Risk-based control selection SHOULD consider:

```text
Threat
  +
Likelihood
  +
Impact
  +
Asset Sensitivity
  +
Exposure
  │
  ▼
Required Control Strength
```

High-risk functionality MAY require stronger or additional controls.

---

## Mandatory Controls

Controls classified as mandatory MUST be satisfied unless an approved exception exists.

Mandatory controls SHOULD apply to risks that could materially undermine:

* confidentiality;
* integrity;
* availability;
* identity security;
* platform trust;
* family privacy;
* release integrity.

Mandatory control failure MAY block release.

---

## Recommended Controls

Recommended controls represent practices that SHOULD normally be implemented.

Deviation SHOULD have a legitimate technical or risk-based reason.

Repeated deviation MAY indicate that the control needs clarification or architectural improvement.

---

## Conditional Controls

Some controls apply only under defined conditions.

Examples include:

* encryption required for sensitive data;
* strong authentication required for privileged operations;
* additional plugin restrictions required for external code;
* signing required for distributable artifacts.

Applicability criteria MUST be explicit.

---

## Control Dependencies

A security control MAY depend on other controls.

Example:

```text
Authorization Control
        │
        └── depends on
              │
              ▼
         Identity Control
              │
              ▼
      Authentication Control
```

Dependent controls SHOULD NOT be considered effective if a required foundational control is ineffective.

---

## Security Compliance

Security compliance is the verified state in which applicable security requirements and controls are satisfied.

Compliance MUST be based on evidence.

A statement such as:

```text
"Security control implemented"
```

is insufficient without appropriate verification when the control is material.

---

## Compliance Model

The FamilyOS compliance model is:

```text
Requirement
    │
    ▼
Applicable Control
    │
    ▼
Implementation
    │
    ▼
Validation
    │
    ▼
Evidence
    │
    ▼
Compliance Decision
```

Compliance decisions SHOULD be reproducible.

---

## Compliance Status

Controls MAY have statuses such as:

```text
COMPLIANT
NON_COMPLIANT
PARTIALLY_COMPLIANT
NOT_APPLICABLE
EXEMPTED
NOT_ASSESSED
```

Status semantics MUST be defined consistently.

---

## Compliant

A control is COMPLIANT when:

* it is applicable;
* required implementation exists;
* validation succeeds;
* required evidence is available;
* no unresolved violation invalidates the control.

Compliance SHOULD reflect actual implementation state.

---

## Non-Compliant

A control is NON_COMPLIANT when a mandatory requirement is not satisfied.

Non-compliance MAY result from:

* missing implementation;
* failed validation;
* missing evidence;
* insecure configuration;
* unresolved finding;
* ineffective control.

Non-compliance MUST be recorded and evaluated according to severity.

---

## Partially Compliant

PARTIALLY_COMPLIANT MAY be used when part of a control is satisfied but material gaps remain.

Partial compliance MUST NOT be used to conceal failure of a mandatory security requirement.

The missing elements SHOULD be explicitly documented.

---

## Not Applicable

A control MAY be marked NOT_APPLICABLE only when its applicability conditions are not met.

The rationale SHOULD be documented where the control is significant.

Not applicable MUST NOT be used as a convenience mechanism to avoid implementation.

---

## Exempted

EXEMPTED indicates that an approved exception temporarily or permanently alters normal compliance expectations.

An exemption MUST reference:

* exception identifier;
* justification;
* owner;
* risk acceptance;
* compensating controls;
* review condition.

---

## Compliance Profiles

FamilyOS MAY define compliance profiles for different classes of components.

Examples include:

```text
Core Platform Profile
Official Plugin Profile
Third-Party Plugin Profile
Infrastructure Profile
CI/CD Profile
Production Profile
Developer Tooling Profile
```

Profiles allow controls to reflect different risk contexts.

---

## Core Platform Profile

The core platform SHOULD satisfy the strongest general FamilyOS security baseline.

Controls SHOULD cover:

* identity;
* authorization;
* data protection;
* secrets;
* cryptography;
* dependencies;
* secure coding;
* observability;
* recovery;
* release integrity.

Core security control failures MAY affect all downstream components.

---

## Official Plugin Profile

Official FamilyOS plugins MUST satisfy security controls appropriate to trusted first-party extensions.

Controls SHOULD include:

* declared capabilities;
* permission boundaries;
* dependency validation;
* secret handling;
* data protection;
* security tests;
* auditability;
* compliance evidence.

Official status MUST NOT waive security requirements.

---

## Third-Party Plugin Profile

Third-party plugins SHOULD be subject to stricter trust-boundary controls.

Requirements MAY include:

* explicit permission declarations;
* restricted capabilities;
* package provenance;
* integrity validation;
* stronger isolation;
* dependency analysis;
* runtime restrictions.

Third-party code MUST NOT be assumed trustworthy solely because it can be installed.

---

## Infrastructure Profile

Infrastructure compliance SHOULD cover:

* operating-system hardening;
* access control;
* network exposure;
* secret storage;
* patch state;
* logging;
* backup security;
* deployment permissions.

Production infrastructure SHOULD have stronger requirements than ordinary development environments.

---

## CI/CD Profile

CI/CD security controls SHOULD include:

* protected credentials;
* workflow permissions;
* branch protections;
* dependency integrity;
* build reproducibility;
* secret masking;
* artifact integrity;
* controlled release authority.

Untrusted contributions MUST NOT automatically receive privileged CI/CD secrets.

---

## Compliance Evidence

Every significant security compliance claim SHOULD be supported by evidence.

Evidence MAY include:

* test results;
* configuration snapshots;
* security scan results;
* static-analysis reports;
* access reviews;
* dependency reports;
* audit records;
* build attestations;
* release validation;
* policy-validation results.

Evidence SHOULD be attributable to a specific control where practical.

---

## Evidence Quality

Security evidence SHOULD be:

* relevant;
* reproducible;
* attributable;
* complete enough to support the claim;
* protected from unauthorized modification;
* appropriately retained.

Evidence that cannot be connected to a control provides limited assurance.

---

## Evidence Sources

Evidence MAY originate from:

```text
Source Code
Tests
CI/CD
Security Scanners
Runtime Observability
Configuration
Build Systems
Release Systems
Governance Reviews
Manual Assessments
```

Automated evidence SHOULD be preferred where it produces reliable repeatable results.

---

## Automated Compliance

FamilyOS SHOULD automate security compliance verification where practical.

Automation MAY include:

* static policy validation;
* secret scanning;
* dependency checks;
* configuration validation;
* permission validation;
* cryptographic baseline validation;
* test execution;
* release-gate checks.

Automation reduces inconsistency but MUST NOT replace human review where engineering judgment is necessary.

---

## Continuous Compliance

Security compliance SHOULD be evaluated continuously rather than only at release time.

```text
Design
  │
  ▼
Implementation
  │
  ▼
Commit
  │
  ▼
CI Validation
  │
  ▼
Build
  │
  ▼
Release Validation
  │
  ▼
Runtime Observation
  │
  ▼
Periodic Review
```

Compliance may change after release because of:

* new vulnerabilities;
* dependency changes;
* configuration drift;
* privilege changes;
* new threats;
* policy changes.

---

## Control Testing

Security controls MUST be testable where technically feasible.

Control testing SHOULD verify not only expected success but also failure behavior.

Examples include:

* unauthorized access denied;
* revoked credential rejected;
* invalid signature rejected;
* secret not logged;
* plugin permission denied;
* insecure configuration detected.

Negative tests are essential to security-control validation.

---

## Control Effectiveness

Implementation alone does not prove effectiveness.

A control MAY exist but fail because of:

* incorrect configuration;
* incomplete coverage;
* bypass paths;
* stale policy;
* insufficient permissions isolation;
* broken monitoring;
* operational misuse.

FamilyOS SHOULD assess whether controls actually achieve their objectives.

---

## Control Coverage

Control coverage SHOULD identify the assets and paths protected by a control.

For example:

```text
Authorization Control
        │
        ├── CLI operations
        ├── Application services
        ├── Plugin capabilities
        └── Repository access
```

Unprotected paths SHOULD be treated as control gaps.

---

## Control Validation Frequency

Control validation frequency SHOULD reflect risk.

Validation MAY occur:

* on every commit;
* on pull request;
* on build;
* on release;
* periodically;
* after architecture changes;
* after incidents.

High-risk controls SHOULD be validated more frequently.

---

## Security Findings

A security finding represents a detected deviation, weakness, failure, or risk associated with a security control or requirement.

Findings SHOULD include:

* identifier;
* affected control;
* description;
* severity;
* evidence;
* affected components;
* remediation owner;
* status.

Findings MUST remain traceable through resolution.

---

## Finding Severity

Security findings SHOULD use a consistent severity model.

A baseline model MAY include:

```text
Critical
High
Medium
Low
Informational
```

Severity SHOULD reflect:

* exploitability;
* impact;
* exposure;
* affected data;
* privilege required;
* blast radius.

---

## Critical Findings

Critical findings represent conditions that may result in severe compromise of FamilyOS security.

Examples MAY include:

* unrestricted authentication bypass;
* exposed production private keys;
* arbitrary privilege escalation;
* release pipeline compromise;
* uncontrolled access to highly sensitive family data.

Critical unresolved findings SHOULD block release.

---

## High Findings

High-severity findings represent substantial security weaknesses that may materially compromise protected assets.

High findings SHOULD normally require remediation before release unless explicitly risk accepted under strict governance.

---

## Medium Findings

Medium findings represent meaningful weaknesses with reduced impact, likelihood, or exposure.

They SHOULD have defined remediation plans.

Repeated unresolved medium findings MAY create cumulative security risk.

---

## Low and Informational Findings

Low-severity findings represent limited security weaknesses or hardening opportunities.

Informational findings MAY identify:

* observations;
* opportunities for improvement;
* future risks.

They SHOULD still remain traceable when relevant.

---

## Finding Lifecycle

Security findings SHOULD follow a defined lifecycle.

```text
Detected
   │
   ▼
Triaged
   │
   ▼
Assigned
   │
   ▼
Remediated
   │
   ▼
Validated
   │
   ▼
Closed
```

Alternative outcomes MAY include:

* accepted risk;
* false positive;
* duplicate;
* deferred remediation.

---

## False Positives

Automated tools MAY generate false positives.

A finding MAY be classified as a false positive only after sufficient review.

The decision SHOULD include documented rationale where the severity would otherwise be significant.

---

## Security Exceptions

A security exception allows temporary or explicitly governed deviation from a control.

Exceptions MUST NOT be informal.

Each exception SHOULD include:

```text
Exception Identifier
Affected Control
Scope
Reason
Risk
Compensating Control
Owner
Approval
Expiration / Review Date
```

---

## Exception Approval

Exception approval SHOULD reflect risk.

Low-risk exceptions MAY require ordinary engineering approval.

High-risk security exceptions SHOULD require security and governance review.

Critical security requirements SHOULD rarely receive exceptions.

---

## Exception Expiration

Temporary exceptions MUST have an expiration or mandatory review condition.

Expired exceptions MUST NOT continue silently.

The system SHOULD treat an expired exception as requiring renewed review or remediation.

---

## Risk Acceptance

Risk acceptance is a governance decision, not a technical workaround.

Accepted risk MUST identify:

* risk being accepted;
* affected assets;
* rationale;
* owner;
* duration;
* required compensating controls.

Risk acceptance MUST NOT be used to hide unresolved technical debt.

---

## Compliance Reporting

FamilyOS SHOULD support security compliance reporting.

Reports MAY include:

* overall compliance status;
* applicable controls;
* failed controls;
* exemptions;
* open findings;
* risk summary;
* evidence references;
* release readiness.

Reports SHOULD be generated from traceable evidence where possible.

---

## Compliance Summary Model

A compliance summary MAY appear as:

```text
Security Compliance
-------------------
Applicable Controls:  48
Compliant:            45
Non-Compliant:         1
Exempted:              1
Not Applicable:        1

Critical Findings:     0
High Findings:         0
Medium Findings:       1

Release Status: PASS
```

Metrics MUST NOT replace qualitative security assessment.

---

## Security Metrics

Compliance metrics MAY track:

* percentage of controls validated;
* open findings by severity;
* remediation age;
* security-test coverage;
* dependency vulnerabilities;
* exception count;
* secret exposures;
* failed authorization tests.

Metrics SHOULD support decisions rather than become targets that distort security behavior.

---

## Security Quality Gates

FamilyOS SHOULD define security quality gates.

Possible gates include:

```text
No Critical Findings
No Unapproved High Findings
Required Security Tests Passing
No Known Exposed Secrets
Approved Cryptographic Baseline
Required Compliance Evidence Present
```

Quality gates SHOULD be objective and automatable where possible.

---

## Commit Security Gate

Commit or pull-request validation MAY include:

* secret scanning;
* static security analysis;
* dependency validation;
* policy validation;
* security unit tests.

Failures SHOULD be visible before changes are merged.

---

## Build Security Gate

Build validation MAY require:

* clean dependency state;
* approved build configuration;
* security tests;
* artifact integrity generation;
* provenance evidence.

The build MUST NOT silently bypass required security validation.

---

## Release Security Gate

Release authorization SHOULD require verification that mandatory security controls remain satisfied.

A release gate MAY evaluate:

```text
Security Tests
      +
Compliance Controls
      +
Open Findings
      +
Exceptions
      +
Artifact Integrity
      +
Release Evidence
      │
      ▼
Release Security Decision
```

A failed mandatory gate SHOULD prevent release unless explicitly governed.

---

## Runtime Compliance

Some controls cannot be fully validated before deployment.

Runtime controls MAY include:

* authorization monitoring;
* configuration drift detection;
* secret-access auditing;
* integrity monitoring;
* authentication anomaly detection.

Runtime evidence SHOULD complement pre-release validation.

---

## Configuration Compliance

Security configuration SHOULD be compared against approved baselines.

Configuration compliance MAY cover:

* authentication policy;
* permission settings;
* network exposure;
* secret sources;
* logging configuration;
* cryptographic configuration.

Configuration drift SHOULD be detectable where risk warrants it.

---

## Dependency Compliance

Third-party dependencies MUST satisfy security requirements appropriate to their risk.

Validation SHOULD consider:

* known vulnerabilities;
* provenance;
* licensing where relevant to governance;
* integrity;
* maintenance state;
* version policy.

Known critical dependency vulnerabilities SHOULD affect release eligibility.

---

## Plugin Security Compliance

Plugins MUST satisfy the controls applicable to their compliance profile.

Plugin security validation SHOULD verify:

* metadata;
* identity;
* capabilities;
* permissions;
* secret handling;
* dependency state;
* data access;
* logging;
* security tests;
* provenance.

Plugin compliance MUST integrate with EPIC-PLUGIN-002 — Plugin Compliance Framework.

---

## Plugin Capability Compliance

Requested plugin capabilities MUST be:

* declared;
* justified;
* validated;
* scoped;
* authorized.

A plugin that requests undocumented or excessive privileges SHOULD fail compliance validation.

---

## Data Compliance

Data controls SHOULD verify:

* classification;
* access restrictions;
* encryption requirements;
* logging restrictions;
* retention;
* backup protection;
* deletion behavior.

Controls SHOULD align with `05-Data-Secrets-and-Cryptography.md`.

---

## Identity Compliance

Identity and access controls SHOULD verify:

* principal management;
* authentication;
* authorization;
* privilege assignment;
* revocation;
* session security;
* access logging.

Controls SHOULD align with `04-Identity-Authentication-and-Authorization.md`.

---

## Cryptographic Compliance

Cryptographic compliance SHOULD verify:

* approved algorithms;
* appropriate key usage;
* key separation;
* key storage;
* rotation capability;
* secure randomness;
* cryptographic failure handling.

Unsupported or prohibited algorithms SHOULD fail validation.

---

## Secret Compliance

Secret-management controls SHOULD verify:

* no committed real secrets;
* approved secret sources;
* least-privilege access;
* environment separation;
* revocation capability;
* logging protection.

Secret exposure SHOULD immediately create a security finding.

---

## Infrastructure Compliance

Infrastructure controls SHOULD evaluate:

* hardening;
* access permissions;
* network boundaries;
* patch levels;
* secret protection;
* backup security;
* observability.

Production infrastructure SHOULD have explicit baseline validation.

---

## Build Compliance

Security controls MUST integrate with EPIC-BLD-001 — Build Framework.

Build compliance SHOULD produce evidence for:

* dependency integrity;
* test results;
* build configuration;
* artifact checksums;
* provenance;
* security validation.

---

## Release Compliance

Security controls MUST integrate with EPIC-REL-001 — Release Framework.

Release compliance SHOULD verify:

* mandatory controls;
* findings;
* exceptions;
* security evidence;
* artifact integrity;
* release authorization.

Release evidence SHOULD be retained according to governance requirements.

---

## Observability Compliance

Security telemetry SHOULD integrate with the FamilyOS Observability Framework.

Observability controls SHOULD validate that important security events are available for:

* authentication;
* authorization;
* privilege changes;
* policy violations;
* secret operations;
* cryptographic failures;
* integrity failures.

Compliance MUST also ensure that observability does not expose sensitive data.

---

## Documentation Compliance

Security controls MUST be documented sufficiently for implementation and validation.

Security documentation SHOULD define:

* requirements;
* applicability;
* implementation expectations;
* evidence;
* exceptions.

Documentation MUST follow EPIC-DOC-001 — Documentation Framework.

---

## Testing Compliance

Security-control validation MUST integrate with EPIC-TST-001 — Testing Framework.

Security testing SHOULD include:

* positive paths;
* negative paths;
* boundary cases;
* failure handling;
* privilege isolation;
* recovery.

A control SHOULD NOT be considered fully validated solely because its successful path works.

---

## Quality Compliance

Security compliance MUST integrate with EPIC-QLT-001 — Quality Framework.

Security-related quality gates SHOULD influence:

* defect severity;
* release readiness;
* technical debt;
* risk decisions;
* continuous improvement.

Security is a required dimension of FamilyOS quality.

---

## Compliance Governance

Security compliance MUST have defined governance.

Governance responsibilities SHOULD include:

* control approval;
* baseline maintenance;
* profile maintenance;
* exception review;
* risk acceptance;
* compliance reporting;
* release gate definition.

Control changes SHOULD be reviewed when they materially alter security guarantees.

---

## Control Change Management

Security controls evolve as FamilyOS changes.

Control changes SHOULD include:

```text
Proposed Change
      │
      ▼
Impact Analysis
      │
      ▼
Security Review
      │
      ▼
Control Update
      │
      ▼
Implementation Update
      │
      ▼
Validation Update
      │
      ▼
Evidence Update
```

A control change MAY require migration of existing compliance evidence.

---

## Control Deprecation

Controls MAY be deprecated when:

* replaced;
* obsolete;
* merged into another control;
* no longer applicable to the architecture.

Deprecation MUST preserve historical traceability.

A replacement SHOULD be identified where applicable.

---

## Compliance Review

Security compliance SHOULD be reviewed periodically.

Review SHOULD verify:

* control relevance;
* implementation effectiveness;
* evidence quality;
* open findings;
* unresolved exceptions;
* new risks;
* changes in architecture.

Compliance review SHOULD produce actionable outcomes.

---

## Independent Review

High-impact controls SHOULD receive independent review where practical.

Independence MAY mean review by:

* another engineer;
* security owner;
* architecture governance;
* release authority.

Independent review reduces the risk of self-validation errors.

---

## Security Attestation

FamilyOS MAY produce security attestations for defined releases, components, or environments.

An attestation SHOULD state:

* evaluated scope;
* applicable baseline;
* validation date;
* compliance state;
* known exceptions;
* evidence reference.

Attestation MUST NOT claim broader assurance than the evaluated scope supports.

---

## Evidence Integrity

Compliance evidence is itself security-relevant.

Evidence SHOULD be protected against:

* unauthorized modification;
* deletion;
* substitution;
* ambiguous attribution.

Important release evidence MAY use:

* checksums;
* signatures;
* immutable records;
* controlled repositories.

---

## Evidence Retention

Evidence retention SHOULD reflect:

* audit requirements;
* release lifecycle;
* security investigations;
* operational needs;
* privacy considerations.

Evidence SHOULD NOT be retained indefinitely without purpose.

---

## Control Automation Architecture

Automated security controls SHOULD integrate into standard FamilyOS engineering workflows.

```text
Developer Change
      │
      ▼
Static Validation
      │
      ▼
Security Tests
      │
      ▼
Compliance Engine
      │
      ▼
Build Gate
      │
      ▼
Release Gate
      │
      ▼
Runtime Monitoring
```

Automation SHOULD provide fast feedback without obscuring control reasoning.

---

## Policy as Code

FamilyOS MAY express suitable security policies as machine-readable rules.

Policy-as-code SHOULD support:

* version control;
* review;
* automated validation;
* reproducibility;
* traceability.

Policy-as-code MUST NOT eliminate documented human-readable policy intent.

---

## Compliance as Code

Compliance rules MAY be automated when applicability and validation logic can be represented reliably.

Compliance-as-code SHOULD make it possible to determine:

```text
Control
  +
System State
  +
Evidence
  │
  ▼
Compliance Result
```

Manual validation MAY remain necessary for architectural or contextual controls.

---

## Security Control Traceability

FamilyOS SHOULD maintain traceability across:

```text
Threat
  │
  ▼
Risk
  │
  ▼
Requirement
  │
  ▼
Control
  │
  ▼
Implementation
  │
  ▼
Test
  │
  ▼
Evidence
  │
  ▼
Compliance Decision
```

Traceability helps demonstrate why each control exists and whether it remains effective.

---

## Security Debt

Unresolved security weaknesses MAY create security debt.

Security debt includes:

* deferred control implementation;
* legacy cryptography;
* excessive privileges;
* outdated dependencies;
* incomplete security tests;
* temporary exceptions.

Security debt MUST remain visible and governed.

---

## Continuous Improvement

Security controls SHOULD improve over time based on:

* incidents;
* findings;
* architecture changes;
* threat evolution;
* testing results;
* operational experience;
* new defensive capabilities.

Control frameworks MUST remain adaptable rather than static.

---

## Security Control Invariants

The following invariants apply across FamilyOS:

1. every mandatory security requirement SHOULD map to one or more verifiable controls;
2. important controls MUST have defined scope;
3. significant controls SHOULD have owners;
4. compliance MUST be evidence-based;
5. critical control failures MUST NOT be silently ignored;
6. exceptions MUST be explicit and governed;
7. compensating controls MUST be documented;
8. compliance automation MUST remain traceable;
9. plugin security MUST be validated against applicable controls;
10. security findings MUST remain traceable through resolution;
11. expired exceptions MUST NOT remain silently active;
12. production releases MUST satisfy applicable security gates;
13. security evidence MUST NOT contain secrets;
14. control effectiveness MUST be reassessed as FamilyOS evolves.

---

## Reference Compliance Flow

The canonical FamilyOS security compliance flow is:

```text
                   Security Requirement
                           │
                           ▼
                      Control Definition
                           │
                           ▼
                       Applicability
                           │
                           ▼
                     Implementation
                           │
                           ▼
                       Validation
                           │
                ┌──────────┴──────────┐
                ▼                     ▼
             PASS                   FAIL
                │                     │
                ▼                     ▼
            Evidence               Finding
                │                     │
                │             ┌───────┴────────┐
                │             ▼                ▼
                │         Remediate        Exception
                │             │                │
                │             └───────┬────────┘
                │                     ▼
                └──────────────► Revalidation
                                      │
                                      ▼
                             Compliance Decision
                                      │
                              ┌───────┴───────┐
                              ▼               ▼
                            PASS            BLOCK
```

This flow defines the baseline security assurance model for FamilyOS engineering and release activities.

## Relationship With Other FamilyOS Frameworks

Security controls and compliance integrate with the wider FamilyOS engineering foundation.

```text
Security Framework
      │
      ├── Security Architecture
      ├── Identity and Authorization
      ├── Data and Cryptography
      └── Security Controls
                │
                ▼
      Compliance and Evidence
                │
     ┌──────────┼───────────┬───────────┐
     ▼          ▼           ▼           ▼
 Testing      Quality      Build      Release
     │          │           │           │
     └──────────┴───────────┴───────────┘
                │
                ▼
         Security Assurance
```

Security compliance does not replace testing, quality, build, release, documentation, observability, or plugin compliance.

It provides the security-specific requirements and assurance criteria that integrate with each framework.

---

## Expected Outcomes

The FamilyOS Security Controls and Compliance model enables:

* explicit security-control definitions;
* risk-based control selection;
* stable control identifiers;
* documented ownership;
* measurable compliance;
* automated validation;
* security evidence collection;
* traceable findings;
* governed exceptions;
* plugin security assurance;
* security quality gates;
* build and release integration;
* continuous compliance;
* auditable security decisions;
* systematic improvement of security posture.

---

## Final Principle

FamilyOS security controls and compliance are based on the following principle:

> A security requirement is not fully established until it is represented by an applicable control, implemented in the system, validated through an appropriate mechanism, and supported by evidence sufficient to demonstrate its effectiveness.

Security controls transform security intent into enforceable safeguards.

Compliance transforms those safeguards into verifiable assurance.

Together, they provide the evidence-based foundation required to determine whether FamilyOS security guarantees remain effective throughout architecture, implementation, operation, and release.
