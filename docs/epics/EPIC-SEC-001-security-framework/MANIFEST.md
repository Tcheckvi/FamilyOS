# EPIC-SEC-001 — Security Framework Manifest

## Document Status

```text
EPIC:                    EPIC-SEC-001
Title:                   Security Framework
Framework Version:       5.0.0

Historical Publication:  Published
Historical Tag:          v5.0.0-security-framework
Historical Tag Policy:   Immutable

Current Activity:         Post-Release Revalidation
Repository Validation:   Validated
Final Revalidation:      Validated
```

---

## 1. Purpose

This manifest defines the canonical repository inventory for:

```text
EPIC-SEC-001 — Security Framework
```

It establishes:

* the canonical numbered-document set;
* the canonical control-document set;
* the expected repository structure;
* document ownership;
* historical publication metadata;
* current normalization metadata;
* validation expectations;
* synchronization requirements.

The manifest is authoritative for repository inventory.

It does not replace the architectural authority of the numbered Security Framework documents.

---

## 2. Repository Location

The canonical repository location is:

```text
docs/epics/EPIC-SEC-001-security-framework/
```

All canonical Security Framework documents SHALL reside directly within this directory unless a future governed revision explicitly changes the repository structure.

---

## 3. Framework Identity

```text
EPIC ID:                 EPIC-SEC-001
Framework Name:          Security Framework
Framework Version:       5.0.0
Framework Type:          Engineering Framework
Domain:                  Security
Lifecycle State:         Completed
```

The framework establishes the canonical FamilyOS security foundation.

---

## 4. Historical Publication

EPIC-SEC-001 was historically published before the current standardized EPIC control-document model was applied.

Historical release:

```text
Tag:                     v5.0.0-security-framework
Commit:                  498fa16e692bf1461df2e4afba8bc4e485837a45
Publication Status:      Published
Tag Policy:              Immutable
```

The historical tag SHALL NOT be moved during post-release normalization.

The current repository representation may therefore differ structurally from the historical tagged representation without invalidating the historical publication.

---

## 5. Historical Repository Structure

At historical publication time, EPIC-SEC-001 consisted of ten numbered documents.

Historical structure:

```text
Numbered Documents:      10
Control Documents:        0
Historical Files:        10
Canonical Range:         00 → 09
```

The historical publication did not contain the current seven standardized control documents.

This distinction SHALL remain explicit in repository metadata.

---

## 6. Current Canonical Structure

The normalized current repository representation consists of:

```text
Numbered Documents:      10
Control Documents:        7
Canonical Files:         17
Canonical Range:         00 → 09
```

Canonical repository equation:

```text
10 numbered documents
+
7 control documents
=
17 canonical files
```

---

## 7. Canonical Numbered Documents

The canonical numbered-document set is:

```text
00-EPIC.md
01-Context-and-Vision.md
02-Security-Principles.md
03-Security-Architecture.md
04-Identity-Authentication-and-Authorization.md
05-Data-Secrets-and-Cryptography.md
06-Threat-Risk-and-Trust-Model.md
07-Security-Controls-and-Compliance.md
08-Implementation-and-Automation.md
09-Validation-and-Release.md
```

The numbered sequence SHALL contain exactly ten documents.

---

## 8. Numbering Contract

The canonical numbered range is:

```text
00 → 09
```

Expected sequence:

```text
00
01
02
03
04
05
06
07
08
09
```

The sequence SHALL contain:

* no missing number;
* no duplicate number;
* no unexpected numbered document;
* no alternate canonical numbering scheme.

---

---

## 21. Control Document Inventory

| Document              | Responsibility                                 |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `EPIC-SEC-001.md`     | Consolidated EPIC summary and governance state |
| `EPIC.yaml`           | Machine-readable framework contract            |
| `README.md`           | Human-readable repository entry point          |

| `Revision-History.md` | Historical and post-release revision record    |

---

## 22. `EPIC-SEC-001.md`

Purpose:

```text
Provides a consolidated control-level representation of EPIC-SEC-001.
```

It SHOULD summarize:

* identity;
* purpose;
* scope;
* architecture;
* principles;
* deliverables;
* dependencies;
* historical publication;
* current lifecycle state;
* validation state.

---

## 23. `EPIC.yaml`

Purpose:

```text
Provides the machine-readable canonical contract for EPIC-SEC-001.
```

It SHALL describe at minimum:

* EPIC identity;
* version;
* status;
* framework type;
* scope;
* deliverables;
* structure;
* baseline state;
* historical publication;
* current validation state.

`EPIC.yaml` SHALL remain valid YAML.

Markdown fences SHALL NOT wrap the physical contents of `EPIC.yaml`.

---

## 24. `README.md`

Purpose:

```text
Provides the human-readable navigation and orientation layer for the Security Framework.
```

It SHOULD explain:

* purpose;
* principles;
* structure;
* major security domains;
* framework relationships;
* historical publication;
* current repository state;
* navigation.

---

## 25. `MANIFEST.md`

Purpose:

```text
Defines the canonical file inventory and structural repository contract.
```

This document is authoritative for expected repository membership.

---

## 26. `CHANGELOG.md`

Purpose:

```text
Records meaningful Security Framework changes over time.
```

The changelog SHALL distinguish:

* historical publication;
* post-release normalization;
* future framework revisions.

Historical information SHALL NOT be rewritten as if normalization changes existed in the historical release.

---

## 27. `VALIDATION.md`

Purpose:

```text
Defines and records the validation contract for the normalized Security Framework repository representation.
```

Validation SHOULD cover:

* YAML;
* filesystem;
* structure;
* numbering;
* references;
* placeholders;
* semantic consistency;
* historical publication integrity;
* repository quality gates;
* final state.

Validation results SHALL be evidence-based.

---

## 28. `Revision-History.md`

Purpose:

```text
Records the historical lifecycle of EPIC-SEC-001 and distinguishes historical publication from later repository normalization.
```

It SHOULD preserve:

* framework origin;
* historical release;
* historical tag;
* publication commit;
* normalization activity;
* validation state;
* future revisions.

---

## 29. Canonical Deliverables

The current canonical deliverable inventory consists of exactly seventeen files:

```text
00-EPIC.md
01-Context-and-Vision.md
02-Security-Principles.md
03-Security-Architecture.md
04-Identity-Authentication-and-Authorization.md
05-Data-Secrets-and-Cryptography.md
06-Threat-Risk-and-Trust-Model.md
07-Security-Controls-and-Compliance.md
08-Implementation-and-Automation.md
09-Validation-and-Release.md
EPIC-SEC-001.md
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

Expected count:

```text
17
```

---

## 30. Inventory Contract

For the normalized repository state:

```text
Declared Files == Actual Files
```

Expected:

```text
Declared Files:          17
Actual Files:            17
Missing Files:            0
Unexpected Files:         0
```

These values SHALL only be marked as validated after repository execution confirms them.

---

## 31. Historical vs Current Structure

Two repository states SHALL be distinguished.

### Historical publication

```text
Tag:                     v5.0.0-security-framework
Numbered Documents:      10
Control Documents:        0
Historical Files:        10
```

### Current normalized repository

```text
Numbered Documents:      10
Control Documents:        7
Canonical Files:         17
```

The normalized repository SHALL NOT imply that the seven control documents were present in the historical tag.

---

## 32. Historical Tag Integrity

The historical release tag is:

```text
v5.0.0-security-framework
```

Expected historical commit:

```text
498fa16e692bf1461df2e4afba8bc4e485837a45
```

Normalization SHALL NOT move or recreate the historical tag.

Required relationship:

```text
historical tag commit
        ≠
future normalization commit
```

The historical tag remains an immutable reference to the originally published Security Framework state.

---

## 33. Repository Synchronization

The following documents SHALL remain structurally synchronized:

```text
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
EPIC-SEC-001.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
CHANGELOG.md
```

Synchronization includes:

* EPIC identity;
* framework version;
* canonical range;
* numbered-document count;
* control-document count;
* canonical-file count;
* historical tag;
* historical publication state;
* current validation state.

---

## 34. Structure Contract

The current expected structure is:

```text
structure:
  numbered_documents: 10
  canonical_document_range: 00-09
  control_documents: 7
  canonical_files: 17
```

Any deviation requires investigation before repository revalidation may pass.

---

## 35. Numbered Document Contract

A canonical numbered document SHALL match:

```text
NN-*.md
```

where:

```text
NN ∈ {00, 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09}
```

Exactly one canonical document SHALL exist for each number.

---

## 36. Control Document Contract

Expected control documents:

```text
EPIC-SEC-001.md
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

Missing or unexpected control documents SHALL prevent structural validation from passing unless explicitly governed by a later framework revision.

---

## 37. Empty File Policy

Canonical files SHALL NOT be empty.

Expected validation result after execution:

```text
Empty Files: 0
```

A zero-byte canonical document SHALL fail repository validation.

---

## 38. Reference Integrity

Local Markdown references SHOULD resolve to existing canonical repository content.

Validation SHALL distinguish between:

* active canonical references;
* historical references;
* illustrative examples;
* external references.

Historical references SHALL NOT automatically be treated as active repository references.

---

## 39. Placeholder Policy

Potential unresolved markers may include:

```text
TODO
TBD
FIXME
PLACEHOLDER
XXX
TO BE DEFINED
TO BE COMPLETED
```

Validation SHALL distinguish actual unresolved placeholders from:

* examples;
* documentation explaining placeholder detection;
* historical text;
* intentionally quoted markers.

Only genuine unresolved blocking placeholders SHALL fail validation.

---

## 40. Security Semantic Integrity

Repository validation SHALL verify that the normalized framework preserves the intended Security Framework semantics.

Important areas include:

* deny by default;
* least privilege;
* explicit trust;
* identity;
* authentication;
* authorization;
* data protection;
* secrets;
* cryptography;
* threat modeling;
* risk management;
* trust boundaries;
* security controls;
* compliance;
* implementation;
* automation;
* validation;
* release security.

Normalization SHALL NOT silently weaken these requirements.

---

## 41. Identity and Authorization Boundary

The framework SHALL preserve the distinction:

```text
Identity
    ≠
Authentication
    ≠
Authorization
```

Authentication proves or increases confidence in identity.

Authorization determines whether an authenticated or otherwise identified subject may perform a specific operation.

The concepts SHALL NOT be collapsed during normalization.

---

## 42. Data and Secret Boundary

The framework SHALL preserve the distinction between ordinary configuration and secrets.

```text
Configuration
    ≠
Secret
```

Secrets require stronger protection, distribution, logging, rotation, and lifecycle controls.

---

## 43. Threat and Risk Integrity

Threat analysis SHALL remain connected to risk.

Conceptually:

```text
Asset
   ↓
Threat
   ↓
Impact + Likelihood
   ↓
Risk
   ↓
Control
   ↓
Residual Risk
```

Security validation SHALL NOT reduce threat modeling to a static checklist.

---

## 44. Security Control Integrity

Controls SHOULD remain attributable to:

* a requirement;
* an owner;
* an implementation;
* evidence;
* a validation mechanism.

Security control existence alone SHALL NOT prove effectiveness.

---

## 45. Plugin Security Boundary

Plugin security SHALL remain integrated with the broader FamilyOS plugin architecture.

Security requirements may apply to:

* plugin identity;
* capabilities;
* permissions;
* provenance;
* dependencies;
* data access;
* execution boundaries;
* compliance.

Official status SHALL NOT automatically grant unrestricted trust.

---

## 46. Testing Boundary

EPIC-TST-001 remains authoritative for general testing architecture.

EPIC-SEC-001 defines security-specific testing requirements.

Relationship:

```text
Security Requirement
        ↓
Testing Mechanism
        ↓
Security Evidence
```

The Security Framework SHALL NOT create an independent competing testing lifecycle.

---

## 47. Quality Boundary

EPIC-QLT-001 remains authoritative for the general Quality Framework.

Security may supply quality evidence such as:

* security findings;
* security test results;
* policy violations;
* control failures;
* unresolved risk.

Security-specific release blocking remains governed through applicable security and release policy.

---

## 48. Build Boundary

EPIC-BLD-001 remains authoritative for build engineering.

Security may define requirements concerning:

* dependencies;
* build environments;
* credentials;
* artifact integrity;
* provenance;
* supply-chain protection.

Security SHALL NOT redefine the general build lifecycle.

---

## 49. Release Boundary

EPIC-REL-001 remains authoritative for release engineering.

EPIC-SEC-001 supplies security evidence and security gates to the release process.

Conceptually:

```text
Security Validation
        ↓
Security Evidence
        ↓
Release Readiness
        ↓
Release Decision
```

Security SHALL NOT introduce a competing release lifecycle.

---

## 50. Observability Boundary

Observability infrastructure may provide security-relevant evidence.

Examples include:

* authentication failures;
* authorization failures;
* anomalous activity;
* control failures;
* security events;
* runtime policy violations.

Security remains responsible for interpreting such evidence within the security model.

---

## 51. Evidence Model

Security revalidation follows:

```text
Requirement
    ↓
Validation
    ↓
Observed Result
    ↓
Evidence
    ↓
Decision
```

Claims SHALL follow evidence.

Evidence SHALL NOT be inferred merely from documentation intent.

---

## 52. Validation Categories

The normalized repository SHOULD be validated across:

```text
YAML Parse
YAML Contract
Filesystem Contract
Numbering Integrity
Control Documents
Empty Files
Manifest Synchronization
README Synchronization
EPIC Summary Synchronization
Changelog Synchronization
Revision History Synchronization
State Consistency
Reference Integrity
Placeholder Validation
Security Principle Consistency
Identity and Access Consistency
Data / Secret / Cryptography Consistency
Threat / Risk / Trust Consistency
Security Control Consistency
Framework Boundary Consistency
Historical Tag Integrity
Ruff
MyPy
Pytest
Diff Check
Final Repository State
```

---

## 53. Validation State

The current normalization activity SHALL initially use:

```text
documentation_status: completed
repository_validation_status: validated
final_validation_status: validated
```

These values SHALL remain pending until validation evidence is actually produced.

---

## 54. Revalidation Transition

Permitted transition:

```text
Validated
        ↓
Repository Checks Executed
        ↓
Evidence Reviewed
        ↓
All Blocking Checks Pass
        ↓
Validated
```

If any blocking requirement fails:

```text
Validated
        ↓
Validation Failure
        ↓
Correction
        ↓
Revalidation
```

---

## 55. Historical Publication State

Historical publication is already complete.

Therefore:

```text
Historical Publication: Published
Historical Tag:          v5.0.0-security-framework
Historical Tag Policy:   Immutable
```

Post-release normalization SHALL NOT return the historical publication to a pending state.

Only the current repository revalidation state is pending.

---

## 56. Change Governance

Changes to canonical repository membership require synchronized updates to:

```text
EPIC.yaml
MANIFEST.md
README.md
EPIC-SEC-001.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
CHANGELOG.md
```

A change affecting numbered-document membership also requires review of:

```text
00-EPIC.md
```

where applicable.

---

## 57. Future Structural Changes

Future versions may extend or reorganize the Security Framework.

Such changes SHALL:

1. preserve historical release evidence;
2. document migration explicitly;
3. update canonical inventory;
4. update machine-readable metadata;
5. validate references;
6. record the revision;
7. avoid rewriting historical tags.
