# Security Framework

## EPIC-SEC-001

## 05 Data, Secrets and Cryptography

### Overview

Data protection, secret management, and cryptography form the confidentiality and integrity foundation of the FamilyOS Security Framework.

FamilyOS manages information that may include highly sensitive family records, identity information, documents, financial data, communication content, security metadata, authentication material, integration credentials, and operational evidence.

This information MUST remain protected throughout its complete lifecycle.

The security model therefore addresses three closely related areas:

* data protection;
* secret management;
* cryptographic controls.

Data protection determines how information is classified, stored, transmitted, processed, retained, and deleted.

Secret management governs highly sensitive credentials and security material.

Cryptography provides mechanisms for confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and secure verification.

These responsibilities MUST remain governed consistently across the FamilyOS platform.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to define the FamilyOS requirements for:

* data classification;
* sensitive-data handling;
* data confidentiality;
* data integrity;
* data at rest;
* data in transit;
* data in use;
* backups;
* retention;
* deletion;
* secret storage;
* secret access;
* secret rotation;
* credential protection;
* cryptographic algorithms;
* key management;
* digital signatures;
* hashing;
* random generation;
* cryptographic lifecycle;
* cryptographic governance.

The objective is to ensure that sensitive FamilyOS information remains protected by design and throughout its operational lifecycle.

---

## Security Objectives

The FamilyOS data and cryptographic security architecture MUST support the following objectives:

1. classify information according to sensitivity;
2. protect confidential information from unauthorized disclosure;
3. protect important information from unauthorized modification;
4. prevent accidental exposure of secrets;
5. provide secure encryption where required;
6. govern cryptographic algorithms and key material;
7. limit secret access according to least privilege;
8. support key and secret rotation;
9. protect backups and exported data;
10. ensure secure deletion where required;
11. prevent sensitive information from leaking through logs or diagnostics;
12. produce evidence that security controls remain effective.

---

## Data Security Model

FamilyOS protects information throughout the complete data lifecycle.

```text
Create
  │
  ▼
Classify
  │
  ▼
Process
  │
  ▼
Store
  │
  ▼
Access
  │
  ▼
Transfer / Share
  │
  ▼
Archive
  │
  ▼
Delete
```

Security controls MUST remain appropriate throughout all relevant lifecycle stages.

---

## Data Classification

FamilyOS SHOULD classify information according to its sensitivity and potential impact if compromised.

A baseline classification model MAY include:

```text
Public
Internal
Confidential
Sensitive
Highly Sensitive
```

Specific domains MAY define more specialized categories where required.

---

## Public Data

Public data is information approved for unrestricted or broadly unrestricted disclosure.

Examples MAY include:

* public documentation;
* public release metadata;
* published project information;
* intentionally public resources.

Public classification MUST still preserve integrity requirements where correctness matters.

Public does not mean uncontrolled.

---

## Internal Data

Internal data is information intended for FamilyOS internal operational use.

Examples MAY include:

* internal architecture information;
* routine operational metadata;
* internal process records;
* non-sensitive system configuration.

Internal data SHOULD NOT automatically be publicly exposed.

---

## Confidential Data

Confidential data includes information whose unauthorized disclosure could create meaningful privacy, operational, or organizational impact.

Examples MAY include:

* private family information;
* internal account information;
* private documents;
* operational records;
* non-public system metadata.

Confidential data SHOULD require controlled access.

---

## Sensitive Data

Sensitive data includes information requiring stronger security controls because compromise could produce significant harm.

Examples MAY include:

* financial information;
* private communications;
* identity data;
* family records;
* security configurations;
* privileged operational information.

Sensitive data SHOULD receive stronger access control, encryption, auditing, and retention controls where appropriate.

---

## Highly Sensitive Data

Highly sensitive data includes information whose compromise could materially undermine FamilyOS security or expose critical private information.

Examples include:

* passwords;
* private cryptographic keys;
* authentication tokens;
* recovery secrets;
* highly privileged credentials;
* sensitive health or financial information where applicable.

Highly sensitive data MUST receive the strongest applicable security controls.

---

## Data Classification Responsibilities

Data classification SHOULD influence:

* access-control requirements;
* encryption requirements;
* logging restrictions;
* backup policies;
* retention periods;
* deletion procedures;
* sharing controls;
* audit requirements.

Classification MUST NOT exist only as documentation.

It SHOULD translate into enforceable technical and operational controls.

---

## Data Ownership

Important FamilyOS data SHOULD have defined ownership.

Ownership MAY identify:

* responsible domain;
* responsible family context;
* responsible service;
* responsible administrative authority.

Ownership information MAY influence:

* authorization;
* retention;
* lifecycle management;
* deletion;
* recovery.

Ownership does not automatically imply unrestricted access.

---

## Data Minimization

FamilyOS SHOULD collect and retain only the information necessary for legitimate platform functionality.

Unnecessary data SHOULD NOT be collected merely because storage is available.

Data minimization reduces:

* privacy exposure;
* attack surface;
* backup complexity;
* incident impact;
* compliance burden.

Sensitive information SHOULD have a clear operational purpose.

---

## Sensitive Data Handling

Sensitive data MUST be protected while:

* stored;
* transmitted;
* processed;
* logged;
* exported;
* backed up;
* restored;
* archived;
* deleted.

Security controls SHOULD reflect both classification and threat model.

---

## Data at Rest

Data at rest includes persistent information stored in:

* files;
* databases;
* local storage;
* backups;
* archives;
* object storage;
* configuration repositories.

Sensitive data at rest SHOULD be protected using appropriate access controls and encryption where warranted.

---

## Storage Access Control

Storage systems MUST enforce appropriate permissions.

Access SHOULD be limited to:

* authorized users;
* authorized services;
* approved plugins;
* authorized administrative processes.

Filesystem or database-level protections SHOULD complement application-layer authorization.

---

## Encryption at Rest

Sensitive and highly sensitive information SHOULD be encrypted at rest when encryption materially improves security.

Encryption at rest MAY apply to:

* databases;
* files;
* backups;
* exported archives;
* credential stores;
* secret stores.

Encryption keys MUST NOT be stored alongside encrypted data in a manner that removes meaningful protection.

---

## Data in Transit

Sensitive information transmitted between security boundaries MUST use protected transport.

Data in transit SHOULD receive:

* confidentiality;
* integrity protection;
* endpoint authentication where appropriate.

Plaintext transmission of secrets or highly sensitive information over untrusted networks is prohibited.

---

## Secure Transport

Approved secure transport mechanisms SHOULD be used for:

* API communication;
* plugin integrations;
* service communication;
* external integrations;
* synchronization;
* remote management.

Transport security configuration MUST avoid obsolete or insecure cryptographic protocols.

---

## Data in Use

Sensitive data remains vulnerable while actively processed.

Applications SHOULD minimize:

* unnecessary plaintext copies;
* unnecessary serialization;
* unnecessary temporary files;
* long-lived memory exposure;
* propagation across unrelated components.

Highly sensitive values SHOULD have the shortest practical lifetime in accessible memory.

---

## Temporary Data

Temporary data MAY contain sensitive information.

Temporary files and intermediate artifacts MUST therefore receive appropriate protection.

Temporary sensitive data SHOULD:

* use restricted permissions;
* have controlled lifetime;
* be deleted when no longer required;
* avoid predictable unsafe locations.

Temporary storage MUST NOT become an ungoverned persistence layer.

---

## Data Integrity

FamilyOS MUST protect important information against unauthorized or accidental modification.

Integrity mechanisms MAY include:

* access controls;
* checksums;
* cryptographic hashes;
* signatures;
* immutable audit records;
* transaction controls;
* validation rules.

Integrity protection SHOULD reflect the criticality of the information.

---

## Integrity Verification

Critical artifacts SHOULD support integrity verification.

Examples include:

* release artifacts;
* backups;
* configuration packages;
* security evidence;
* plugin packages;
* migration files.

Integrity verification SHOULD be reproducible and auditable.

---

## Data Authenticity

Where it is important to establish origin, FamilyOS SHOULD support authenticity verification.

Authenticity MAY be established through:

* digital signatures;
* authenticated transport;
* trusted identity assertions;
* signed metadata;
* trusted provenance.

Authenticity SHOULD be distinguishable from integrity alone.

---

## Data Retention

FamilyOS SHOULD define retention requirements for important classes of information.

Retention decisions SHOULD consider:

* operational need;
* user expectations;
* security;
* auditability;
* recovery;
* compliance;
* privacy.

Sensitive information SHOULD NOT be retained indefinitely without justification.

---

## Data Deletion

Data deletion MUST be controlled and consistent with retention requirements.

Deletion SHOULD consider:

* primary data;
* replicas;
* caches;
* backups;
* exports;
* temporary files;
* indexes.

A deletion request MUST NOT be considered complete if unnecessary live copies remain accessible without justification.

---

## Secure Deletion

Secure deletion requirements SHOULD reflect the underlying storage technology and threat model.

Logical deletion MAY be sufficient in some contexts.

Higher-risk environments MAY require additional controls.

Deletion procedures MUST be documented where they affect security guarantees.

---

## Backup Security

Backups frequently contain the same sensitive information as production storage and MUST receive equivalent protection.

Backup security SHOULD include:

* access control;
* encryption where appropriate;
* integrity verification;
* retention governance;
* recovery testing;
* secure deletion.

Backup systems MUST NOT become weaker copies of production security controls.

---

## Backup Encryption

Sensitive backups SHOULD be encrypted.

Backup encryption keys MUST be protected independently from ordinary backup storage where practical.

Loss of backup encryption keys MUST be considered in recovery planning.

---

## Backup Integrity

FamilyOS SHOULD verify that backups have not been corrupted or modified unexpectedly.

Integrity verification MAY include:

* hashes;
* signatures;
* controlled restore testing;
* metadata validation.

A backup that cannot be trusted SHOULD NOT be used as a recovery source without investigation.

---

## Exported Data

Exported data leaves normal application security boundaries.

Exports SHOULD therefore carry explicit security considerations.

Export controls MAY include:

* authorization;
* encryption;
* integrity protection;
* expiration;
* restricted destination handling;
* audit logging.

Sensitive exports MUST NOT silently receive weaker protections than source data.

---

## Data Sharing

Sharing sensitive information MUST require explicit authorization.

Sharing decisions SHOULD consider:

* receiving principal;
* resource sensitivity;
* family boundary;
* destination security;
* duration;
* revocation.

Cross-family or external sharing MUST NOT occur implicitly.

---

## Logging and Sensitive Data

Logs MUST NOT become an uncontrolled channel for sensitive data exposure.

The following SHOULD NOT appear in logs:

* passwords;
* private keys;
* full authentication tokens;
* secret values;
* unnecessary financial information;
* highly sensitive personal information.

Logs SHOULD prefer identifiers and redacted values where sufficient.

---

## Data Redaction

Redaction SHOULD be applied when partial information is sufficient for diagnostics or audit purposes.

Examples include:

```text
Token:
abcd********wxyz

Account:
****1234

Email:
t***@example.com
```

Redaction MUST NOT create a reversible exposure when the value is intended to remain secret.

---

## Secrets

Secrets are security-sensitive values that provide authentication, authorization, cryptographic, or privileged access.

Secrets include:

* passwords;
* API keys;
* private keys;
* signing keys;
* database credentials;
* access tokens;
* refresh tokens;
* recovery codes;
* service credentials;
* encryption keys.

Secrets MUST be treated separately from ordinary configuration.

---

## Secret Management Architecture

The preferred FamilyOS secret access model is:

```text
Application / Service
        │
        ▼
Secret Abstraction
        │
        ▼
Authorization
        │
        ▼
Secret Provider
        │
        ▼
Protected Secret Storage
```

Applications SHOULD retrieve secrets only when required.

---

## Secret Storage

Secrets MUST NOT be stored directly in source code.

Secrets SHOULD NOT be committed to:

* Git repositories;
* documentation;
* examples containing real credentials;
* issue trackers;
* build logs;
* test snapshots.

Approved secret storage mechanisms SHOULD provide access control and auditability where practical.

---

## Environment Variables

Environment variables MAY be used for secret injection where appropriate.

However, environment variables MUST NOT automatically be considered secure simply because they are external to source code.

Risks MAY include:

* process inspection;
* debug dumps;
* inherited environments;
* CI logs;
* accidental printing.

Highly sensitive environments SHOULD use stronger secret-management mechanisms where available.

---

## Secret Access

Secret access MUST follow least privilege.

Each principal SHOULD receive access only to secrets required for its responsibilities.

Secret access SHOULD be scoped by:

* application;
* environment;
* service;
* plugin;
* operation.

Broad shared secrets SHOULD be avoided.

---

## Secret Distribution

Secret distribution SHOULD minimize exposure.

Secrets SHOULD NOT be transmitted through:

* unencrypted messaging;
* public documentation;
* source-control comments;
* ordinary ticket systems;
* insecure command-line arguments where avoidable.

Automated distribution SHOULD prefer authenticated secret-management channels.

---

## Secret Rotation

Long-lived secrets SHOULD support rotation.

Rotation MAY be required because of:

* policy;
* compromise;
* personnel changes;
* environment changes;
* credential age;
* cryptographic lifecycle requirements.

Rotation SHOULD minimize service disruption while eliminating use of obsolete credentials.

---

## Secret Revocation

Compromised or obsolete secrets MUST be revocable.

Revocation SHOULD invalidate the secret as quickly as practical.

Systems MUST NOT continue accepting a revoked secret indefinitely because of stale caches or configuration.

---

## Secret Versioning

Secret-management systems MAY support versioned secrets.

Versioning SHOULD allow controlled migration from:

```text
Secret v1
   │
   ▼
Secret v2
   │
   ▼
Revoke v1
```

Multiple valid secret versions SHOULD exist only for the shortest necessary transition period.

---

## Secret Lifetime

Secrets SHOULD have an appropriate lifetime.

Short-lived credentials SHOULD be preferred when they materially reduce compromise impact.

Permanent credentials SHOULD require strong justification.

---

## Secret Exposure Response

When a secret is suspected of exposure:

```text
Detect Exposure
      │
      ▼
Revoke Secret
      │
      ▼
Issue Replacement
      │
      ▼
Update Dependents
      │
      ▼
Investigate Usage
      │
      ▼
Validate Recovery
```

Changing the secret alone MAY be insufficient if unauthorized use occurred.

---

## Cryptographic Architecture

FamilyOS cryptographic mechanisms MUST use established, reviewed cryptographic primitives.

Custom cryptographic algorithm design is prohibited unless explicitly justified through expert review and governance.

Cryptographic use cases include:

* encryption;
* hashing;
* password hashing;
* integrity verification;
* signatures;
* token generation;
* secure randomness;
* key derivation.

---

## Approved Cryptography

FamilyOS SHOULD maintain an approved cryptographic baseline.

The baseline SHOULD define acceptable:

* algorithms;
* key sizes;
* modes;
* protocols;
* libraries;
* configuration.

Obsolete or known-insecure algorithms MUST NOT be used for new security-sensitive functionality.

---

## Cryptographic Agility

The architecture SHOULD support cryptographic agility.

Cryptographic agility allows algorithms and parameters to evolve without requiring complete redesign.

Systems SHOULD avoid embedding unnecessary assumptions about a single permanent algorithm.

---

## Encryption

Encryption provides confidentiality.

FamilyOS encryption MUST use approved algorithms and secure modes.

Encryption implementation MUST correctly handle:

* keys;
* nonces;
* initialization values;
* authentication tags where applicable;
* failure conditions.

Encryption without integrity protection SHOULD be avoided when authenticated encryption is available and appropriate.

---

## Authenticated Encryption

Authenticated encryption SHOULD be preferred where both confidentiality and integrity are required.

Authenticated encryption provides protection against:

* unauthorized disclosure;
* undetected modification.

Decryption failures MUST be handled safely.

---

## Hashing

Cryptographic hashing MAY be used for:

* integrity checks;
* artifact verification;
* content identification;
* signatures;
* controlled fingerprinting.

General-purpose cryptographic hashes MUST NOT be confused with password-hashing functions.

---

## Password Hashing

Passwords MUST use dedicated password-hashing algorithms designed to resist brute-force attacks.

Password hashing SHOULD use configurable work factors.

Ordinary fast hashes MUST NOT be used as password storage mechanisms.

---

## Digital Signatures

Digital signatures MAY be used when FamilyOS must establish:

* integrity;
* authenticity;
* provenance;
* signer identity.

Potential uses include:

* release artifacts;
* plugin packages;
* security evidence;
* configuration bundles;
* trusted metadata.

Signing keys MUST receive strong protection.

---

## Signature Verification

Signature verification MUST validate:

* trusted key;
* signed content;
* signature validity;
* algorithm policy.

A valid signature from an untrusted key MUST NOT automatically establish trust.

---

## Message Authentication

Message authentication mechanisms MAY protect integrity and authenticity where digital signatures are not required.

Keys used for message authentication MUST remain protected.

Shared-key authentication SHOULD consider the consequences of every holder being able to generate valid authentication data.

---

## Cryptographic Randomness

Security-sensitive random values MUST come from a cryptographically secure random source.

Secure randomness is required for values such as:

* tokens;
* nonces;
* session identifiers;
* reset credentials;
* cryptographic keys;
* unpredictable identifiers where security depends on unpredictability.

General-purpose pseudo-random generators MUST NOT be used when cryptographic unpredictability is required.

---

## Key Management

Cryptographic keys are high-value security assets.

Key management MUST address:

```text
Generate
  │
  ▼
Store
  │
  ▼
Distribute
  │
  ▼
Use
  │
  ▼
Rotate
  │
  ▼
Revoke
  │
  ▼
Archive / Destroy
```

Every key SHOULD have a defined purpose.

---

## Key Separation

Keys SHOULD be separated by purpose.

For example:

```text
Encryption Key
Signing Key
Authentication Key
Backup Key
Environment-Specific Key
```

The same cryptographic key SHOULD NOT be reused for unrelated purposes without explicit justification.

---

## Environment Key Separation

Development, testing, staging, and production SHOULD use separate key material.

Production keys MUST NOT be copied into lower-trust environments merely for convenience.

Compromise of development infrastructure SHOULD NOT automatically compromise production cryptography.

---

## Key Generation

Cryptographic keys MUST be generated using approved secure mechanisms.

Key generation MUST use sufficient entropy.

Manually selected keys MUST NOT be used where cryptographically random key generation is required.

---

## Key Storage

Private and symmetric keys MUST be stored securely.

Appropriate controls MAY include:

* protected key stores;
* hardware-backed key storage;
* secret-management systems;
* strict filesystem permissions;
* encrypted key containers.

Plaintext key files with unrestricted access are prohibited.

---

## Key Access

Key access MUST follow least privilege.

Only components that require a key SHOULD have access to it.

Where practical, systems SHOULD perform cryptographic operations without exposing raw key material to ordinary application code.

---

## Key Rotation

Keys SHOULD support rotation according to:

* risk;
* policy;
* age;
* algorithm changes;
* compromise;
* environment changes.

Rotation procedures MUST consider existing encrypted or signed data.

---

## Key Revocation

Compromised signing, authentication, or access keys MUST be revocable.

Revocation SHOULD prevent future trust in operations performed after the revocation point according to the relevant trust model.

Historical validation MAY require additional timestamp or provenance information.

---

## Key Destruction

Keys that are no longer required SHOULD be securely destroyed where practical.

Key destruction MUST consider:

* active systems;
* backups;
* archives;
* recovery requirements.

Destroying a key MAY permanently render encrypted data inaccessible and therefore MUST be governed carefully.

---

## Key Recovery

Some encryption systems MAY require controlled key recovery mechanisms.

Recovery keys MUST receive security protections equal to or stronger than ordinary operational keys.

Recovery mechanisms MUST NOT create an unrestricted security bypass.

---

## Cryptographic Metadata

Cryptographic operations SHOULD retain sufficient metadata for future verification.

Metadata MAY include:

* algorithm identifier;
* key identifier;
* version;
* creation time;
* signature metadata;
* encryption parameters.

Sensitive key material MUST NOT be included in metadata.

---

## Cryptographic Failure Handling

Cryptographic failures MUST fail safely.

Examples include:

* invalid signature;
* authentication-tag failure;
* unavailable key;
* unsupported algorithm;
* corrupted ciphertext.

Failure MUST NOT silently downgrade to insecure processing.

---

## Algorithm Deprecation

Cryptographic algorithms MAY become unsafe over time.

FamilyOS SHOULD support formal deprecation.

Deprecation SHOULD define:

* affected algorithm;
* affected data;
* replacement mechanism;
* migration strategy;
* deadline;
* compatibility considerations.

Deprecated algorithms MUST NOT remain indefinitely because of convenience.

---

## Cryptographic Libraries

FamilyOS SHOULD use established and maintained cryptographic libraries.

Cryptographic implementation SHOULD avoid direct low-level primitive composition unless required.

Library selection SHOULD consider:

* security history;
* maintenance;
* documentation;
* platform support;
* dependency risk.

---

## Secret and Cryptographic Configuration

Cryptographic and secret-related configuration is security-sensitive.

Configuration SHOULD include explicit control over:

* algorithm selection;
* key identifiers;
* secret providers;
* rotation policy;
* credential source;
* environment binding.

Unsafe cryptographic defaults MUST be avoided.

---

## Plugin Data Security

Plugins MAY process sensitive FamilyOS data.

Plugin access MUST therefore respect:

* data classification;
* authorization;
* capability boundaries;
* logging restrictions;
* secret isolation.

Plugins MUST NOT receive direct access to unrelated secrets or sensitive data.

---

## Plugin Secrets

Plugin credentials SHOULD be isolated by plugin and purpose.

A plugin SHOULD NOT automatically receive:

* platform administrative credentials;
* other plugin secrets;
* unrelated integration credentials;
* unrestricted cryptographic key access.

Plugin secrets MUST be revocable independently where practical.

---

## Plugin Cryptography

Plugins requiring cryptographic functionality SHOULD use approved FamilyOS abstractions or approved libraries.

Plugins MUST NOT introduce insecure cryptographic mechanisms that bypass platform policy.

Compliance validation SHOULD include cryptographic requirements where applicable.

---

## Service Secrets

Services SHOULD use dedicated credentials.

Shared credentials across unrelated services SHOULD be avoided.

Dedicated service secrets improve:

* revocation;
* attribution;
* auditability;
* containment.

---

## CI/CD Secrets

Build and deployment systems frequently require sensitive credentials.

CI/CD secrets MUST be protected carefully.

Controls SHOULD include:

* least privilege;
* environment separation;
* masked logs;
* restricted secret exposure;
* short-lived credentials where possible;
* controlled release permissions.

Pull requests from untrusted contexts MUST NOT automatically receive privileged secrets.

---

## Build Artifact Security

Artifacts SHOULD support verification when security-sensitive.

Controls MAY include:

* cryptographic hashes;
* digital signatures;
* provenance records;
* reproducible build evidence.

Artifact verification integrates with EPIC-BLD-001 — Build Framework.

---

## Release Cryptography

Release processes MAY use cryptographic mechanisms to establish integrity and authenticity.

Potential controls include:

* signed Git tags;
* signed release artifacts;
* checksum publication;
* provenance signatures.

Release cryptography MUST integrate with EPIC-REL-001 — Release Framework.

---

## Data Security and Observability

Security observability MUST avoid exposing protected data.

Telemetry SHOULD capture:

* access attempts;
* access decisions;
* secret access events;
* key operations;
* cryptographic failures;
* data-integrity failures.

Telemetry MUST NOT record secret values.

---

## Secret Access Auditing

Access to highly sensitive secrets SHOULD be auditable where technically appropriate.

Audit records MAY include:

```text
Timestamp
Principal
Secret Identifier
Operation
Environment
Result
Correlation Identifier
```

Audit records MUST NOT include the secret value.

---

## Key Operation Auditing

Security-sensitive key operations SHOULD be observable.

Examples include:

* key creation;
* key rotation;
* key revocation;
* key deletion;
* signing operation;
* decryption failure.

Auditability MUST respect performance and privacy requirements.

---

## Data Breach Containment

If sensitive data exposure is suspected, FamilyOS SHOULD support:

```text
Detect
  │
  ▼
Contain
  │
  ▼
Restrict Access
  │
  ▼
Revoke Credentials
  │
  ▼
Rotate Keys / Secrets
  │
  ▼
Investigate
  │
  ▼
Recover
  │
  ▼
Validate Security
```

The response SHOULD depend on the affected data classification and security context.

---

## Secret Leakage Detection

FamilyOS engineering processes SHOULD include mechanisms capable of identifying accidental secret exposure.

Detection MAY include:

* repository secret scanning;
* CI validation;
* release validation;
* dependency and artifact inspection.

Detected secrets MUST be treated as compromised unless exposure can be reliably ruled out.

---

## Data and Clean Architecture

Data protection concerns MUST respect Clean Architecture boundaries.

Domain logic SHOULD define sensitivity and protection requirements without becoming dependent on specific cryptographic infrastructure.

Example:

```text
Domain
  │
  ├── Defines protection requirement
  │
  ▼
Application
  │
  ├── Requests secure operation
  │
  ▼
Security Port
  │
  ▼
Infrastructure
      └── Cryptography / Secret Provider
```

Infrastructure implementations MUST satisfy domain and application security requirements.

---

## Data and Domain-Driven Design

Different bounded contexts MAY have different security requirements.

Examples include:

```text
Identity
  └── Identity data protection

Finance
  └── Financial data protection

Documents
  └── Document confidentiality

Communication
  └── Message confidentiality

Security
  └── Credentials and cryptographic material
```

Each domain SHOULD define appropriate sensitivity while following common FamilyOS security standards.

---

## Data and Identity Security

This document extends the controls established by `04-Identity-Authentication-and-Authorization.md`.

Authentication and authorization depend on secure handling of:

* credentials;
* tokens;
* session secrets;
* identity data;
* cryptographic keys.

Weak secret or key handling can invalidate otherwise correct access-control architecture.

---

## Data and Plugin Compliance

EPIC-PLUGIN-002 — Plugin Compliance Framework SHOULD validate plugin behavior relating to:

* sensitive data access;
* secret handling;
* prohibited plaintext secrets;
* cryptographic usage;
* logging;
* external transfer.

Non-compliant handling of highly sensitive information SHOULD be treated as a high-severity finding.

---

## Data and Testing

Security tests SHOULD cover:

* encryption and decryption;
* invalid ciphertext handling;
* signature validation;
* secret retrieval authorization;
* secret revocation;
* key rotation;
* sensitive logging prevention;
* access denial;
* backup integrity;
* export authorization.

Tests MUST NOT embed real production secrets.

---

## Test Secrets

Test environments MUST use dedicated non-production secrets.

Test credentials SHOULD be clearly distinguishable from production credentials.

Test data SHOULD avoid unnecessary use of real sensitive personal information.

---

## Data and Quality

Data protection and cryptographic controls MUST participate in FamilyOS quality governance.

Quality evidence MAY include:

* cryptographic tests;
* secret scanning results;
* data-protection reviews;
* dependency validation;
* backup recovery tests;
* integrity verification results.

Critical failures MUST affect release eligibility.

---

## Cryptographic Governance

Material cryptographic changes SHOULD require security review.

Review SHOULD be required when introducing or changing:

* algorithms;
* key sizes;
* password hashing;
* signing mechanisms;
* encryption architecture;
* key-management systems;
* secret providers.

Important decisions SHOULD be documented through FamilyOS architectural governance.

---

## Exception Management

Exceptions to data-protection, secret-management, or cryptographic standards MUST be explicit.

An exception MUST identify:

* affected requirement;
* scope;
* justification;
* risk;
* compensating controls;
* owner;
* review or expiration condition.

Undocumented cryptographic exceptions are prohibited.

---

## Data Security Evidence

Security claims SHOULD be supported by evidence.

Evidence MAY include:

```text
Data Classification
       +
Access Policies
       +
Encryption Configuration
       +
Key Management Records
       +
Secret Scanning
       +
Security Tests
       +
Audit Evidence
       +
Release Validation
```

Evidence SHOULD demonstrate that controls exist and remain operational.

---

## Data Security Lifecycle

FamilyOS data security follows a continuous lifecycle.

```text
Classify
   │
   ▼
Protect
   │
   ▼
Use
   │
   ▼
Observe
   │
   ▼
Validate
   │
   ▼
Rotate / Update
   │
   ▼
Archive / Delete
```

Security controls MUST evolve as risk, technology, and system architecture change.

---

## Security Invariants

The following invariants apply across FamilyOS:

1. sensitive data MUST have appropriate access control;
2. secrets MUST NOT be stored in source code;
3. highly sensitive secrets MUST NOT appear in logs;
4. production secrets MUST remain separated from lower environments;
5. cryptographic operations MUST use approved mechanisms;
6. cryptographic keys MUST have controlled lifecycle management;
7. passwords MUST use dedicated secure password hashing;
8. security-sensitive random values MUST use cryptographically secure randomness;
9. cryptographic failure MUST NOT silently downgrade security;
10. backup protection MUST reflect source-data sensitivity;
11. plugin access to secrets MUST be explicitly authorized;
12. secret and key access MUST follow least privilege;
13. compromised secrets MUST be revocable;
14. important cryptographic changes MUST be governed.

---

## Reference Security Flow

The canonical data and cryptographic protection model is:

```text

## Expected Outcomes

The FamilyOS Data, Secrets and Cryptography architecture enables:

* consistent data classification;
* secure sensitive-data handling;
* protected storage and transmission;
* controlled data sharing;
* secure backup protection;
* safe data deletion;
* governed secret storage;
* least-privilege secret access;
* credential rotation;
* controlled key management;
* approved cryptographic mechanisms;
* secure password handling;
* cryptographic integrity verification;
* auditable key and secret operations;
* improved compromise containment.

## Final Principle

FamilyOS data security is based on the following principle:

> Sensitive information must remain protected throughout its complete lifecycle, while secrets and cryptographic keys must be treated as independently governed security assets whose compromise can invalidate broader platform protections.

Data protection preserves the confidentiality and integrity of family information.

Secret management protects the credentials and security material used to control access.

Cryptography provides the technical mechanisms required to establish confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and trust.

Together, these controls form the information-protection foundation of the FamilyOS Security Framework.
