# Security Framework

## EPIC-SEC-001

### Implementation and Automation

### Overview

This document defines the implementation strategy and automation model for the FamilyOS Security Framework.

The objective is to transform the principles, architecture, identity model, data-protection requirements, threat model, risk model, and security controls defined by EPIC-SEC-001 into concrete and testable engineering capabilities.

Security implementation must remain:

* incremental;
* explicit;
* testable;
* composable;
* deterministic;
* observable;
* vendor-neutral;
* proportional to risk.

The framework does not require FamilyOS to implement every possible security mechanism before development can continue.

Instead, it defines a practical path from security architecture to enforceable platform behavior.

---

## Implementation Philosophy

FamilyOS security follows the implementation sequence:

```text
Security Principles
        ↓
Security Contracts
        ↓
Core Security Primitives
        ↓
Enforcement
        ↓
Validation
        ↓
Evidence
        ↓
Automation
        ↓
Lifecycle Gates
```

Each stage should produce usable engineering value.

Security architecture must ultimately become executable behavior.

---

## Implementation Objectives

The implementation must provide mechanisms capable of supporting:

* explicit security contexts;
* authentication boundaries;
* authorization decisions;
* permission enforcement;
* least privilege;
* deny-by-default behavior;
* secret access;
* data protection;
* cryptographic abstraction;
* security events;
* plugin security;
* configuration validation;
* security findings;
* automated testing;
* CI validation;
* release security gates.

Not every mechanism must be implemented simultaneously.

---

## Implementation Boundaries

Security implementation SHOULD respect existing FamilyOS architecture.

Security logic must not become an uncontrolled dependency throughout the platform.

The preferred direction is:

```text
Domain / Capability
        ↓
Security Contract
        ↓
Security Service
        ↓
Provider / Adapter
```

External security technologies remain behind adapters where practical.

---

## Clean Architecture Alignment

Security implementation must preserve FamilyOS Clean Architecture principles.

Core security abstractions SHOULD NOT depend directly on:

* external identity providers;
* cloud secret managers;
* vendor authorization engines;
* external telemetry platforms;
* infrastructure-specific cryptographic services.

Instead:

```text
FamilyOS Core
      │
      ▼
Security Port
      │
      ▼
Infrastructure Adapter
      │
      ▼
External Provider
```

Dependencies point inward toward stable FamilyOS contracts.

---

## Security Package Structure

A future implementation may use a structure conceptually similar to:

```text
src/familyos_cli/
└── security/
    ├── models/
    ├── policies/
    ├── services/
    ├── ports/
    ├── adapters/
    ├── validation/
    └── events/
```

The exact package structure must follow the repository architecture existing at implementation time.

EPIC-SEC-001 does not mandate unnecessary directories before code requires them.

---

## Core Security Primitives

The first implementation SHOULD establish a small set of reusable security primitives.

A conceptual foundation is:

```text
SecurityContext
Permission
AuthorizationRequest
AuthorizationDecision
SecurityEvent
SecurityFinding
SecretReference
```

These primitives provide stable contracts around which implementation can evolve.

---

## Security Context

`SecurityContext` represents security-relevant information associated with an execution context.

A conceptual model may contain:

```text
SecurityContext

actor_id
actor_type
authentication_state
permissions
roles
attributes
correlation_id
```

The actual implementation SHOULD remain smaller if some fields are unnecessary.

---

## Security Context Requirements

A security context SHOULD be:

* explicit;
* immutable where practical;
* scoped to execution;
* testable;
* independent of global mutable state.

Security context must not become a container for arbitrary application data.

---

## Security Context Propagation

Where an operation crosses relevant application boundaries, required security context should propagate explicitly.

Conceptually:

```text
Request
   ↓
Authentication
   ↓
SecurityContext
   ↓
Application Service
   ↓
Capability
   ↓
Authorization
```

Implicit global security state should be avoided.

---

## Permission Model

Permissions represent stable authorization concepts.

Conceptually:

```text
Permission(
    namespace,
    action
)
```

or a canonical identifier such as:

```text
document.read
document.write
communication.send
security.configure
plugin.activate
```

The exact representation should remain simple and strongly validated.

---

## Permission Naming

Permission names SHOULD be:

* stable;
* explicit;
* deterministic;
* namespace-aware;
* human-readable;
* machine-processable.

Permission semantics must not silently vary between components.

---

## Authorization Request

A protected operation SHOULD be representable as an authorization request.

Conceptually:

```text
AuthorizationRequest

actor
permission
resource
context
```

Not every request requires every field.

The model should remain proportional to actual policy needs.

---

## Authorization Decision

Authorization must return an explicit decision.

A conceptual result may include:

```text
AuthorizationDecision

allowed
reason
policy
```

The critical invariant is:

```text
No explicit allow
      ↓
DENY
```

---

## Authorization Reasons

Stable reason categories improve explainability and testing.

Examples may include:

```text
ALLOWED
MISSING_PERMISSION
NOT_AUTHENTICATED
INVALID_SECURITY_CONTEXT
RESOURCE_RESTRICTED
POLICY_DENIED
```

Reason categories SHOULD NOT expose sensitive internal details.

---

## Authorization Service

A central authorization contract may conceptually provide:

```text
authorize(context, permission, resource) -> AuthorizationDecision
```

The implementation may later support more advanced policy evaluation.

The initial contract should remain small.

---

## Enforcement

Authorization contracts have value only when enforcement occurs at meaningful boundaries.

Typical enforcement locations include:

* application services;
* capabilities;
* administrative operations;
* protected repository operations;
* plugin boundaries;
* secret access.

Security checks should not be scattered randomly across helper functions.

---

## Enforcement Pattern

A protected capability may follow:

```text
Request
   ↓
Validate Input
   ↓
Build Security Context
   ↓
Authorize
   │
   ├── DENY ──► Security Event + Failure
   │
   └── ALLOW
          ↓
      Execute Capability
```

The pattern should remain predictable across FamilyOS.

---

## Denial Behavior

Authorization denial SHOULD:

* stop the protected operation;
* return a controlled failure;
* avoid exposing protected information;
* produce security evidence when appropriate.

Denial must not silently fall through to execution.

---

## Authentication Integration

EPIC-SEC-001 does not require a specific authentication provider.

Authentication should be integrated through stable contracts.

Conceptually:

```text
Credential / Identity Evidence
          ↓
Authentication Port
          ↓
Authentication Provider
          ↓
Authenticated Identity
          ↓
SecurityContext
```

This preserves vendor neutrality.

---

## Authentication Providers

Future adapters may support:

* local development identity;
* CLI identity;
* operating-system identity;
* external identity providers;
* service identities.

The framework should not require these providers before concrete use cases exist.

---

## Test Authentication

Tests SHOULD use deterministic authentication providers.

For example:

```text
TestIdentityProvider
      ↓
Known Test Identity
      ↓
Known Permissions
```

Tests must not depend on production credentials.

---

## Secret Provider Contract

Secret access SHOULD occur through a dedicated contract.

Conceptually:

```text
SecretProvider

get(reference)
exists(reference)
```

Mutation operations should only be introduced when required.

---

## Secret References

Application code SHOULD refer to secrets indirectly.

For example:

```text
SecretReference("integration.payment.api_key")
```

rather than embedding the secret value.

This separates secret identity from secret material.

---

## Local Secret Provider

Development environments MAY use a simple local provider.

The provider must still respect fundamental security rules.

It must not encourage:

* committed secrets;
* secret logging;
* production credential reuse.

---

## Test Secret Provider

Tests SHOULD use deterministic synthetic secrets.

Example:

```text
InMemorySecretProvider
```

with synthetic values.

This enables repeatable testing without external infrastructure.

---

## Production Secret Providers

Future production adapters may integrate with external secret-management systems.

The core architecture should not depend on which provider is selected.

---

## Secret Redaction

Security implementation SHOULD provide consistent mechanisms for preventing accidental secret exposure.

Sensitive values SHOULD NOT appear in:

* logs;
* traces;
* exceptions;
* diagnostic dumps;
* generated reports.

Where automatic redaction is introduced, tests must verify its behavior.

---

## Cryptographic Ports

Cryptographic functionality SHOULD be exposed through purpose-specific interfaces where abstraction provides value.

Possible contracts include:

```text
Encryptor
Signer
Verifier
Hasher
KeyProvider
```

A single generic cryptography service should be avoided if it obscures security intent.

---

## Cryptographic Adapters

Adapters should use established cryptographic libraries.

The implementation MUST NOT create custom algorithms.

Algorithm selection should be centralized enough to support future cryptographic agility.

---

## Data Protection Enforcement

Data-protection requirements may be enforced at several layers.

```text
Authorization
      ↓
Capability
      ↓
Repository
      ↓
Storage Adapter
```

Encryption and access control solve different problems and should not be conflated.

---

## Security Events

Security-sensitive operations SHOULD produce structured events where useful.

A conceptual event may include:

```text
SecurityEvent

event_name
timestamp
component
actor_reference
operation
outcome
reason
correlation_id
```

Protected content and secrets must not be included unnecessarily.

---

## Security Event Integration

Security events SHOULD integrate with the Observability Framework.

Conceptually:

```text
Security Control
      ↓
Security Event
      ↓
Observability Contract
      ↓
Configured Sink
```

Security should not create an entirely separate telemetry architecture.

---

## Security Event Categories

Initial categories may include:

```text
authentication.success
authentication.failed

authorization.allowed
authorization.denied

secret.access.failed

security.configuration.invalid

security.validation.failed

plugin.permission.denied
```

Not every successful operation needs to generate an event.

Signal volume must remain proportional.

---

## Security Findings

Automated validation SHOULD produce structured security findings.

A conceptual model may contain:

```text
SecurityFinding

identifier
category
severity
message
component
evidence
remediation
```

Findings should be machine-processable where practical.

---

## Finding Severity

A simple initial severity model is:

```text
LOW
MEDIUM
HIGH
CRITICAL
```

Severity should align with the risk model defined in `06-Threat-Risk-and-Trust-Model.md`.

---

## Security Validation Result

Security validation SHOULD produce an aggregate result.

Conceptually:

```text
SecurityValidationResult

passed
findings
evidence
```

This result may later participate in quality and release gates.

---

## Configuration Validation

Security-sensitive configuration SHOULD be validated before use.

Validation may verify:

* required fields;
* allowed values;
* provider availability;
* permission definitions;
* cryptographic configuration;
* unsafe combinations.

---

## Startup Security Validation

Critical invalid security configuration MAY prevent startup or capability activation.

Conceptually:

```text
Load Configuration
       ↓
Security Validation
       │
       ├── VALID ──► Continue
       │
       └── INVALID ──► Fail Safely
```

Silent insecure fallback is prohibited.

---

## Plugin Security Implementation

Plugins SHOULD consume platform security contracts rather than implement independent alternatives.

A protected plugin operation may follow:

```text
Plugin Request
      ↓
Declared Capability
      ↓
Required Permission
      ↓
Authorization
      ↓
Execution
```

---

## Plugin Permission Metadata

Where useful, plugin metadata MAY declare security requirements.

Conceptually:

```yaml
permissions:
  - document.read
  - communication.send
```

The exact schema should align with the existing plugin architecture.

---

## Plugin Activation Validation

Before activation, applicable plugins MAY be validated for:

* declared permissions;
* configuration;
* prohibited secret exposure;
* compliance requirements;
* dependency rules;
* external integration declarations.

This should integrate with the existing Plugin Compliance Framework.

---

## Security and Plugin Compliance

The relationship is:

```text
Security Framework
      ↓
Defines Security Requirements
      ↓
Plugin Compliance Framework
      ↓
Validates Plugin Conformance
```

Security MUST NOT duplicate the entire compliance engine.

---

## Repository Security

Repositories should remain focused on persistence concerns.

Where repository-level protection is required, it should complement rather than replace capability-level authorization.

The preferred pattern is:

```text
Application
     ↓
Authorization
     ↓
Capability
     ↓
Repository
```

---

## Integration Security Implementation

External integrations SHOULD use dedicated adapters.

The adapter boundary provides a natural location for:

* credential retrieval;
* transport configuration;
* input validation;
* output validation;
* timeout handling;
* error translation;
* security telemetry.

---

## Integration Credentials

Integration adapters SHOULD obtain credentials through the Secret Provider contract.

Conceptually:

```text
Integration Adapter
       ↓
SecretReference
       ↓
SecretProvider
       ↓
Credential
```

Credential values must not become normal application configuration.

---

## Dependency Security Automation

Dependency security SHOULD build upon the existing dependency and build architecture.

Automation MAY include:

* dependency inventory;
* known-vulnerability checks;
* version-policy checks;
* prohibited dependency checks;
* lock consistency checks.

New tooling should only be introduced when it provides clear value.

---

## Secret Detection Automation

Source and configuration files SHOULD be checked for accidentally committed secrets where practical.

Automation may detect patterns associated with:

* private keys;
* API tokens;
* passwords;
* cloud credentials;
* known credential formats.

Detection must be tuned to avoid unusable false-positive rates.

---

## Static Security Analysis

Security-specific static analysis MAY complement existing FamilyOS checks.

Existing baseline checks remain:

```text
Ruff
MyPy
```

Security-specific tools should only be added when their findings are actionable and maintainable.

---

## Dynamic Security Tests

Security behavior SHOULD primarily be validated through executable tests.

Examples include:

* authentication tests;
* authorization tests;
* negative permission tests;
* invalid-input tests;
* plugin boundary tests;
* secret-provider tests;
* configuration tests;
* security-event tests.

---

## Authorization Test Matrix

Authorization tests SHOULD include both positive and negative cases.

Example:

```text
Permission Present
      ↓
ALLOW

Permission Missing
      ↓
DENY

Invalid Context
      ↓
DENY

Unauthenticated Actor
      ↓
DENY
```

Negative cases are mandatory security evidence.

---

## Security Boundary Tests

Important trust boundaries SHOULD receive direct tests.

Examples include:

```text
User → Application

Application → Capability

Plugin → Platform

Capability → Repository

FamilyOS → External Integration

Component → Secret Provider
```

Tests should verify both intended access and prohibited access.

---

## Security Regression Tests

When a security defect is fixed, a regression test SHOULD be added whenever practical.

The expected lifecycle is:

```text
Security Defect
      ↓
Fix
      ↓
Regression Test
      ↓
Permanent Protection
```

This converts discovered vulnerabilities into lasting engineering knowledge.

---

## Property-Based Security Testing

Property-based testing MAY be introduced when security invariants benefit from broad input exploration.

Examples include:

* identifier validation;
* parser robustness;
* permission normalization;
* security-event sanitization.

It is optional and should be justified by value.

---

## Fuzz Testing

Fuzz testing MAY be introduced for high-risk parsers or externally exposed boundaries.

It is not required as a universal FamilyOS security tool.

---

## Security Test Fixtures

Security fixtures SHOULD use:

* synthetic actors;
* synthetic identities;
* synthetic permissions;
* synthetic secrets;
* isolated resources.

Fixtures should be deterministic.

---

## CI Security Pipeline

Security validation should integrate incrementally into CI.

A conceptual pipeline is:

```text
Source
  ↓
Formatting / Linting
  ↓
Type Checking
  ↓
Tests
  ↓
Security Validation
  ↓
Build
  ↓
Release Validation
```

The exact ordering may evolve with the existing FamilyOS pipeline.

---

## Fast Security Checks

Frequently executed checks should remain fast.

Examples include:

* permission-model tests;
* configuration validation;
* secret-pattern checks;
* security unit tests.

Fast checks support developer feedback.

---

## Extended Security Checks

More expensive checks MAY run less frequently.

Examples include:

* comprehensive dependency analysis;
* large integration security suites;
* deeper artifact inspection.

Execution frequency should reflect cost and risk.

---

## Local Security Validation

Developers SHOULD be able to execute core security validation locally.

Security must not depend entirely on remote CI.

A future command may conceptually provide:

```text
familyos security validate
```

The exact CLI command should only be introduced when implementation requires it.

---

## Machine-Readable Results

Automation SHOULD produce structured results where practical.

Possible formats may include:

```text
JSON
Typed Python Models
Structured CLI Results
```

Human-readable output may be derived from these structures.

---

## Deterministic Validation

Given the same:

```text
source
configuration
security policy
dependencies
```

security validation SHOULD produce equivalent results whenever external vulnerability intelligence is not involved.

External data sources must be explicitly identified when they introduce time-dependent results.

---

## Security Evidence

Automation should produce evidence suitable for:

* development;
* code review;
* quality gates;
* release validation;
* future compliance;
* incident analysis.

Evidence must remain proportional to its purpose.

---

## Evidence Integrity

Security evidence must not claim successful validation when checks were:

* skipped unexpectedly;
* unavailable;
* silently disabled;
* partially executed.

Automation SHOULD distinguish:

```text
PASS
FAIL
SKIPPED
ERROR
```

where relevant.

---

## Fail-Open Versus Fail-Closed Automation

Security-critical enforcement SHOULD normally fail closed.

For example:

```text
Authorization Engine Error
        ↓
DENY
```

Engineering validation pipelines require more nuanced behavior.

For example, temporary external vulnerability-service unavailability may produce:

```text
ERROR
```

rather than falsely reporting:

```text
PASS
```

---

## Security Gates

Security automation may produce lifecycle gates.

A conceptual model is:

```text
Security Findings
       ↓
Risk Classification
       ↓
Gate Policy
       ↓
PASS / BLOCK / REVIEW
```

---

## Critical Findings

Critical findings SHOULD normally block release.

Examples may include:

* committed production secret;
* authorization bypass;
* known critical dependency vulnerability with applicable exposure;
* broken cryptographic verification;
* unrestricted sensitive plugin access.

Exact policy must remain risk-based.

---

## High Findings

High-severity findings SHOULD normally require remediation or explicit security review before release.

---

## Medium and Low Findings

Medium and low findings may be:

* tracked;
* reviewed;
* accepted temporarily;
* scheduled for remediation.

They should not automatically create permanent release paralysis.

---

## Risk Acceptance Automation

Automation MAY record explicit risk acceptance metadata.

It MUST NOT silently convert unresolved findings into successful validation.

---

## Build Integration

Security automation should consume the Build Framework rather than create an independent build process.

Possible integration points include:

* dependency validation;
* source scanning;
* artifact validation;
* secret exclusion;
* reproducibility evidence.

---

## Release Integration

Security validation should integrate with the Release Framework.

Conceptually:

```text
Release Candidate
       ↓
Quality Validation
       ↓
Security Validation
       ↓
Release Decision
```

Security should not create a separate competing release lifecycle.

---

## Observability Integration

Security implementation should use the Observability Framework for runtime evidence.

The relationship is:

```text
Security Control
       ↓
Structured Security Event
       ↓
Observability
       ↓
Configured Destination
```

Security telemetry remains subject to privacy and redaction requirements.

---

## Quality Integration

Security validation results may become Quality Framework evidence.

Conceptually:

```text
Security Tests
      +
Security Validation
      +
Security Findings
      ↓
Quality Evidence
```

This allows security to participate in existing engineering gates.

---

## Documentation Integration

Security contracts that developers must use SHOULD be documented near their implementation.

Architecture documentation should remain focused on stable rules.

Detailed API documentation should derive from actual code once implementation exists.

---

## Developer Workflow

A security-aware development workflow SHOULD become:

```text
Design Change
      ↓
Identify Security Impact
      ↓
Implement
      ↓
Add / Update Tests
      ↓
Run Security Validation
      ↓
Review Findings
      ↓
Commit
```

Security should become part of normal engineering rather than a separate final phase.

---

## Security Review Triggers

Additional review SHOULD be considered when a change affects:

* authentication;
* authorization;
* permission semantics;
* trust boundaries;
* secret handling;
* cryptography;
* sensitive data flow;
* plugin privileges;
* external integrations.

Not every code change requires dedicated security review.

---

## Automation Principles

Security automation follows these rules:

```text
Automate Stable Contracts

Prefer Deterministic Checks

Produce Structured Evidence

Avoid Silent Skips

Minimize False Positives

Keep Fast Checks Fast

Use Risk-Based Gates

Do Not Duplicate Existing Frameworks
```

---

## Automation Must Not Replace Architecture

Security tooling cannot compensate for unclear trust boundaries or undefined authorization semantics.

The correct sequence is:

```text
Architecture
    ↓
Contract
    ↓
Implementation
    ↓
Automation
```

not:

```text
Security Scanner
      ↓
Architecture
```

---

## Automation Must Not Replace Review

Automated security validation is necessary but not sufficient.

Some changes require architectural reasoning that automated tools cannot fully perform.

Automation supports engineering judgment.

It does not eliminate it.

---

## Avoiding Tool Proliferation

Before introducing a security tool, FamilyOS SHOULD ask:

1. Which threat does it address?
2. Which control does it validate?
3. What evidence does it produce?
4. Can an existing tool provide the same evidence?
5. How will false positives be handled?
6. Who maintains the integration?
7. Does it work locally and in CI where required?

Tools without clear answers should not be introduced.

---

## Implementation Phases

Security implementation SHOULD proceed incrementally.

A recommended sequence is:

```text
Phase 1
Core Security Models

Phase 2
Authorization

Phase 3
Secret Management

Phase 4
Security Events

Phase 5
Plugin Security Integration

Phase 6
Security Validation

Phase 7
CI Automation

Phase 8
Release Gates
```

These phases may overlap where implementation naturally requires it.

---

## Phase 1 — Core Security Models

Initial models SHOULD establish:

```text
SecurityContext
Permission
AuthorizationDecision
SecurityEvent
SecurityFinding
```

The goal is a stable vocabulary.

---

## Phase 2 — Authorization

Authorization implementation SHOULD establish:

* permission evaluation;
* deny-by-default behavior;
* explainable decisions;
* deterministic tests.

This is one of the highest-priority runtime controls.

---

## Phase 3 — Secret Management

Secret-management implementation SHOULD establish:

* `SecretReference`;
* provider contract;
* local/test provider;
* safe failure behavior;
* secret-leak tests.

External production providers can follow later.

---

## Phase 4 — Security Events

Security events SHOULD integrate with the Observability Framework.

Initial implementation should prioritize high-value events rather than emitting excessive telemetry.

---

## Phase 5 — Plugin Security

Plugin integration SHOULD establish:

* permission requirements;
* compliance integration;
* protected capability access;
* negative authorization tests.

This phase builds upon the existing plugin architecture.

---

## Phase 6 — Security Validation

A unified validation layer SHOULD aggregate relevant security findings.

It may initially consume:

```text
Security Tests
Configuration Checks
Secret Checks
Plugin Compliance
Dependency Evidence
```

---

## Phase 7 — CI Automation

Stable local validation should then be integrated into CI.

CI should not become the first environment where security behavior can be tested.

---

## Phase 8 — Release Gates

Only mature, reliable security validations should become blocking release gates.

This prevents unstable security automation from unnecessarily disrupting development.

---

## Minimal Viable Security Foundation

The minimum useful implementation for FamilyOS is:

```text
SecurityContext
       +
Permission
       +
Authorization Contract
       +
Deny-by-Default Enforcement
       +
Secret Provider Contract
       +
Security Events
       +
Security Tests
       =
Minimum Security Foundation
```

This foundation provides substantial security value without requiring enterprise infrastructure.

---

## Implementation Anti-Patterns

FamilyOS SHOULD avoid the following patterns.

### Global Security State

```text
GLOBAL_CURRENT_USER
GLOBAL_PERMISSIONS
```

Uncontrolled global state reduces testability and isolation.

### Scattered Authorization

Permission checks distributed randomly across unrelated helpers create inconsistent enforcement.

### Hard-Coded Secrets

Credentials embedded directly in code or configuration files are prohibited.

### Provider Coupling

Core domain code should not directly depend on vendor-specific identity or secret APIs.

### Security Through Logging

Logging suspicious behavior does not replace preventing unauthorized behavior.

### Security Through Obscurity

Hidden implementation details must not be treated as primary security controls.

### Automatic Trust

Installed, internal, or official components must not receive unrestricted access automatically.

---

## Implementation Quality Requirements

Security implementation MUST satisfy applicable FamilyOS engineering quality standards.

At minimum:

```text
Ruff
MyPy
Pytest
```

must continue to pass for affected implementation scope.

Security-specific checks may supplement these requirements.

---

## Test Coverage Expectations

Security-critical behavior SHOULD receive strong behavioral coverage.

Coverage must emphasize:

* trust boundaries;
* denied behavior;
* invalid states;
* failure modes;
* sensitive data handling.

A numeric coverage percentage alone does not prove security.

---

## Performance Expectations

Security implementation should avoid unnecessary performance cost.

However, required authorization and validation MUST NOT be bypassed merely to improve benchmark results.

Performance optimization must preserve security invariants.

---

## Backward Compatibility

Security changes may intentionally restrict behavior that was previously permitted.

Compatibility MUST NOT justify preserving clearly insecure behavior indefinitely.

When a security change is breaking, FamilyOS SHOULD provide an explicit migration path where practical.

---

## Migration Strategy

Security migrations may involve:

```text
Introduce Contract
      ↓
Support Transitional Behavior
      ↓
Emit Deprecation Evidence
      ↓
Update Consumers
      ↓
Remove Unsafe Behavior
```

Transitional compatibility must not silently disable essential protections.

---

## Operational Readiness

Before security mechanisms are relied upon operationally, FamilyOS should be able to determine:

* whether the control is active;
* whether configuration is valid;
* whether failures are observable;
* whether tests verify expected behavior;
* whether recovery procedures exist where required.

This prepares the platform for the future Operations Framework.

---

## Future Automation

As FamilyOS matures, automation may expand toward:

* security posture evaluation;
* automated dependency remediation;
* credential rotation workflows;
* policy analysis;
* artifact verification;
* plugin trust scoring;
* security regression detection;
* incident-response automation.

These capabilities are explicitly future-oriented.

They are not prerequisites for EPIC-SEC-001 completion.

---

## Implementation Exit Criteria

The implementation architecture defined by EPIC-SEC-001 is ready when FamilyOS has clear answers for:

```text
How is security context represented?

How are permissions represented?

Where is authorization enforced?

What happens when authorization fails?

How are secrets accessed?

How are cryptographic providers isolated?

How are security events emitted?

How are plugins constrained?

How are security findings represented?

How are security controls tested?

How does CI consume security evidence?

How can release decisions consume security results?
```

---

## Automation Exit Criteria

Security automation is sufficiently defined when:

* stable security contracts can be tested;
* security findings have structured representation;
* negative authorization behavior is testable;
* configuration can be validated;
* secret exposure can be checked;
* plugin security can integrate with compliance;
* CI integration is defined;
* risk-based release gating is possible;
* automation does not duplicate existing FamilyOS frameworks.

---

## Success Criteria

This implementation and automation model succeeds when security can move from architecture into code without requiring another large documentation phase.

The target lifecycle is:

```text
Security Requirement
        ↓
Implementation
        ↓
Automated Test
        ↓
Validation
        ↓
Security Evidence
        ↓
Quality / Release Gate
```

---

## Expected Outcome

After implementation of this model, FamilyOS security should become a normal part of engineering.

Developers should be able to:

```text
Declare security requirements
        ↓
Use stable security contracts
        ↓
Implement protected behavior
        ↓
Test allowed and denied behavior
        ↓
Generate security evidence
        ↓
Pass automated validation
```

Security becomes enforceable rather than aspirational.

## Conclusion

EPIC-SEC-001 deliberately avoids building a large security platform before FamilyOS needs one.

The implementation strategy begins with small, stable, high-value primitives and expands only when concrete requirements justify additional capability.

The governing implementation principle is:

> Build the smallest security mechanisms that enforce explicit contracts, test them at real trust boundaries, automate stable checks, and use their evidence throughout the engineering lifecycle.

This approach allows FamilyOS to become progressively more secure without sacrificing architectural clarity, developer usability, or implementation momentum.
