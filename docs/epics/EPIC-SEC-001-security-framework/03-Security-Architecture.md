# Security Framework

## 03 Security Architecture

### Overview

The FamilyOS Security Architecture defines the structural security model used to protect the platform, its users, family data, services, plugins, infrastructure, and operational environments.

Security architecture establishes how security responsibilities are distributed across the FamilyOS ecosystem and how security controls are integrated into system boundaries, components, interfaces, workflows, and trust relationships.

The architecture follows a defense-in-depth approach in which no individual security mechanism is considered sufficient on its own.

Security must therefore exist across multiple architectural layers and remain enforceable independently whenever possible.

The Security Architecture provides the structural foundation required to implement the principles defined by EPIC-SEC-001 consistently across the complete FamilyOS platform.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of the Security Architecture is to define how FamilyOS translates security principles into enforceable architectural structures.

It establishes:

* security boundaries;
* trust boundaries;
* security layers;
* identity and access control integration;
* authorization enforcement points;
* data protection boundaries;
* cryptographic responsibilities;
* secret management boundaries;
* plugin security isolation;
* infrastructure security controls;
* security observability;
* auditability requirements;
* security failure containment;
* recovery responsibilities.

The architecture ensures that security is part of the platform structure rather than an additional layer applied after implementation.

---

## Architectural Objectives

The FamilyOS Security Architecture MUST support the following objectives:

1. protect family and platform data;
2. authenticate identities reliably;
3. authorize operations explicitly;
4. minimize privileges;
5. isolate security domains;
6. protect sensitive information at rest and in transit;
7. prevent unauthorized capability execution;
8. contain failures and compromises;
9. produce sufficient security evidence;
10. detect suspicious behavior;
11. support secure recovery;
12. preserve security across platform evolution.

Security controls MUST remain compatible with the modular and extensible architecture of FamilyOS.

---

## Security Architecture Model

FamilyOS uses a layered security architecture.

```text
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|                    Security Governance                       |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|                 Security Policy & Assurance                  |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|              Identity / Authentication / Access              |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|               Authorization & Capability Layer               |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|                  Application Security                        |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|                     Plugin Security                          |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|                 Data Protection Layer                        |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|              Secrets & Cryptographic Services                |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|             Infrastructure & Runtime Security                |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|             Observability / Audit / Detection                |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|                 Recovery & Resilience                        |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Each layer provides independent controls while cooperating with adjacent layers.

A weakness in one layer MUST NOT automatically result in unrestricted access to the entire platform.

---

## Defense in Depth

Defense in depth is a fundamental architectural requirement.

FamilyOS MUST NOT depend on a single control for protecting critical assets.

Security-sensitive operations SHOULD normally be protected by multiple independent mechanisms.

For example:

```text
Identity Verification
        │
        ▼
Authentication
        │
        ▼
Authorization
        │
        ▼
Capability Validation
        │
        ▼
Policy Enforcement
        │
        ▼
Domain Validation
        │
        ▼
Secure Data Access
        │
        ▼
Audit Event
```

Each stage reduces the probability that a failure at another stage produces a complete security compromise.

---

## Trust Model

FamilyOS MUST operate according to explicit trust relationships.

Trust MUST NOT be granted implicitly because a component is:

* internal;
* installed locally;
* part of an official plugin;
* executed by the FamilyOS process;
* connected to a trusted service;
* operating inside a trusted network.

Every meaningful security relationship MUST have a defined trust basis.

---

## Trust Boundaries

A trust boundary exists whenever information, commands, identities, or capabilities move between components with different security assumptions.

Important FamilyOS trust boundaries include:

```text
User
  │
  ▼
CLI / Interface
  │
  ▼
FamilyOS Application
  │
  ├────────────► Plugin Runtime
  │
  ├────────────► Domain Services
  │
  ├────────────► Repositories
  │
  └────────────► External Integrations
                     │
                     ▼
               External Systems
```

Additional boundaries may exist between:

* processes;
* devices;
* family members;
* administrators;
* plugins;
* external providers;
* storage systems;
* networks;
* deployment environments.

Crossing a trust boundary MUST trigger appropriate security controls.

---

## Zero-Trust Principles

FamilyOS security architecture SHOULD apply zero-trust principles where appropriate.

The fundamental assumption is:

> No component receives permanent trust merely because of its location or architectural position.

Security decisions SHOULD therefore consider:

* verified identity;
* current authorization;
* requested capability;
* resource sensitivity;
* execution context;
* policy state;
* environmental conditions;
* available security evidence.

Trust SHOULD be continuously justified rather than permanently inherited.

---

## Security Domains

FamilyOS separates security responsibilities into logical security domains.

Primary domains include:

```text
Identity Security
Authentication Security
Authorization Security
Application Security
Plugin Security
Data Security
Cryptographic Security
Secret Management
Infrastructure Security
Supply Chain Security
Observability Security
Operational Security
Recovery Security
```

Each domain MUST define clear ownership and control responsibilities.

Security domains MAY share common platform services but MUST preserve their individual security guarantees.

---

## Identity Architecture

Identity provides the basis for security decisions involving users, services, plugins, devices, and system actors.

FamilyOS MUST maintain explicit identities for security-relevant actors.

An identity may represent:

* a person;
* a family member;
* an administrator;
* a service;
* a plugin;
* a device;
* an integration;
* an automation;
* a system process.

Identity information MUST be treated as security-sensitive data.

---

## Authentication Architecture

Authentication establishes whether an actor is the identity it claims to represent.

Authentication mechanisms MUST be appropriate for the sensitivity of the protected operation.

The architecture SHOULD support stronger authentication mechanisms for higher-risk actions.

Authentication flow:

```text
Actor
  │
  ▼
Identity Claim
  │
  ▼
Authentication Mechanism
  │
  ▼
Credential Verification
  │
  ▼
Authenticated Identity
  │
  ▼
Authorization Evaluation
```

Authentication success MUST NOT itself imply authorization.

---

## Authorization Architecture

Authorization determines whether an authenticated actor may perform a requested operation.

FamilyOS MUST use explicit authorization decisions for security-sensitive operations.

The authorization model SHOULD support:

* roles;
* permissions;
* capabilities;
* resource ownership;
* policies;
* contextual constraints.

A simplified authorization flow is:

```text
Identity
   +
Requested Action
   +
Target Resource
   +
Execution Context
   │
   ▼
Authorization Engine
   │
   ├── Allow
   │
   └── Deny
```

The default outcome SHOULD be denial when authorization cannot be determined reliably.

---

## Least Privilege Architecture

Every actor and component MUST receive only the permissions necessary to perform its intended responsibilities.

Least privilege applies to:

* users;
* services;
* plugins;
* repositories;
* processes;
* CI/CD systems;
* deployment environments;
* automation;
* infrastructure components.

Privileges SHOULD be:

* minimal;
* explicit;
* scoped;
* reviewable;
* revocable.

Temporary privilege elevation SHOULD be preferred over permanent broad privilege assignment.

---

## Capability Security

FamilyOS uses capabilities as important architectural units of functionality.

Security-sensitive capabilities MUST have explicit security requirements.

Capability execution SHOULD follow:

```text
Capability Request
        │
        ▼
Identity Verification
        │
        ▼
Authorization Check
        │
        ▼
Policy Evaluation
        │
        ▼
Input Validation
        │
        ▼
Capability Execution
        │
        ▼
Result Validation
        │
        ▼
Security Audit Event
```

Capability security MUST remain compatible with the FamilyOS plugin architecture.

---

## Application Security Layer

The application layer is responsible for enforcing security rules close to business operations.

Application security includes:

* input validation;
* authorization checks;
* secure error handling;
* domain invariant enforcement;
* sensitive operation controls;
* output protection;
* security event generation.

Security controls SHOULD be placed as close as practical to the operation they protect.

Critical authorization MUST NOT depend exclusively on user-interface restrictions.

---

## Domain Security

Domain logic MUST preserve security invariants.

Examples include:

* ownership restrictions;
* access restrictions;
* family membership constraints;
* protected document rules;
* sensitive financial operations;
* communication permissions;
* security state transitions.

Domain objects MUST NOT assume that upstream layers have already performed every necessary security check.

Critical invariants SHOULD remain enforceable inside the domain boundary whenever appropriate.

---

## Plugin Security Architecture

Plugins extend FamilyOS capabilities and therefore represent an important security boundary.

Plugins MUST NOT receive unrestricted platform access by default.

Plugin security MUST support:

* explicit capability declaration;
* permission boundaries;
* controlled platform API access;
* policy validation;
* input validation;
* dependency validation;
* auditability;
* compliance verification.

The architecture SHOULD treat plugin privileges as explicitly granted capabilities.

---

## Official Plugin Security

Official plugins are trusted to a higher operational degree only after satisfying defined governance and compliance requirements.

Official status MUST NOT bypass security controls.

Official plugins remain subject to:

* capability restrictions;
* security policies;
* testing requirements;
* compliance validation;
* dependency controls;
* security review;
* release governance.

Trust in official plugins MUST remain evidence-based.

---

## Third-Party Plugin Security

Third-party plugins MUST be treated as potentially untrusted extensions.

The architecture SHOULD support stronger restrictions for externally developed plugins.

Possible controls include:

* permission manifests;
* capability allowlists;
* restricted APIs;
* isolated execution;
* resource quotas;
* network restrictions;
* filesystem restrictions;
* signature verification;
* provenance validation.

Third-party code MUST NOT automatically inherit the privileges of the FamilyOS runtime.

---

## Data Security Architecture

FamilyOS manages information that may be highly sensitive to families.

Data protection MUST therefore exist throughout the complete data lifecycle.

```text
Creation
   │
   ▼
Processing
   │
   ▼
Storage
   │
   ▼
Access
   │
   ▼
Sharing
   │
   ▼
Archival
   │
   ▼
Deletion
```

Security controls MUST remain appropriate at every stage.

---

## Data Classification

Security controls SHOULD be driven by data sensitivity.

FamilyOS SHOULD support classification categories such as:

```text
Public
Internal
Confidential
Sensitive
Highly Sensitive
```

Classification MAY influence:

* authorization requirements;
* encryption requirements;
* audit requirements;
* retention rules;
* sharing restrictions;
* backup controls;
* deletion requirements.

Higher sensitivity MUST result in stronger protection where appropriate.

---

## Data at Rest

Sensitive data stored persistently MUST receive appropriate protection.

Controls MAY include:

* filesystem permissions;
* database authorization;
* encryption;
* key separation;
* secure backup;
* integrity verification.

Plaintext storage of secrets or highly sensitive credentials MUST be prohibited.

---

## Data in Transit

Sensitive information transmitted across trust boundaries MUST use secure communication mechanisms.

Transport protection SHOULD provide:

* confidentiality;
* integrity;
* endpoint authentication where appropriate.

Insecure transport protocols MUST NOT be used for sensitive FamilyOS communication without explicit and justified exception handling.

---

## Data in Use

Data may remain sensitive while being processed.

The architecture SHOULD minimize:

* unnecessary copies;
* excessive retention in memory;
* exposure through logs;
* temporary plaintext artifacts;
* transmission to unrelated components.

Sensitive values MUST NOT be included in diagnostic output unless explicitly required and securely controlled.

---

## Cryptographic Architecture

Cryptographic operations MUST be centralized or governed sufficiently to prevent inconsistent security practices.

The architecture SHOULD define approved mechanisms for:

* encryption;
* hashing;
* digital signatures;
* integrity verification;
* key derivation;
* secure token generation;
* random value generation.

Custom cryptographic algorithms MUST NOT be introduced where established and reviewed cryptographic mechanisms are available.

---

## Key Management

Cryptographic keys MUST be treated as high-value security assets.

Key management MUST address:

* generation;
* storage;
* access;
* rotation;
* revocation;
* backup;
* recovery;
* destruction.

Keys SHOULD be separated according to their purpose and security domain.

A compromise of one key SHOULD NOT unnecessarily compromise unrelated security domains.

---

## Secrets Architecture

Secrets include:

* passwords;
* API keys;
* private keys;
* access tokens;
* refresh tokens;
* signing credentials;
* service credentials.

Secrets MUST NOT be embedded directly in source code.

Secret access MUST follow least privilege.

The preferred architecture is:

```text
Application
    │
    ▼
Secret Interface
    │
    ▼
Authorized Secret Provider
    │
    ▼
Protected Secret Storage
```

Secret values SHOULD remain outside ordinary application configuration whenever possible.

---

## Configuration Security

Configuration can materially affect system security.

Security-sensitive configuration MUST therefore be governed.

Examples include:

* authentication settings;
* authorization policies;
* plugin permissions;
* network configuration;
* cryptographic settings;
* logging configuration;
* deployment permissions.

Unsafe defaults MUST be avoided.

Secure defaults SHOULD be used wherever possible.

---

## Infrastructure Security Architecture

Infrastructure security protects the runtime environment supporting FamilyOS.

Infrastructure controls SHOULD address:

* operating systems;
* containers;
* virtual machines;
* networks;
* storage;
* deployment platforms;
* CI/CD environments;
* build infrastructure.

Infrastructure MUST be hardened according to its exposure and security role.

---

## Environment Isolation

Development, testing, staging, and production environments SHOULD be logically separated.

```text
Development
     │
     ▼
Testing
     │
     ▼
Staging
     │
     ▼
Production
```

Credentials and sensitive production data MUST NOT automatically propagate into lower-trust environments.

Production privileges MUST remain independently controlled.

---

## Network Security

Network access SHOULD follow least-access principles.

The architecture SHOULD minimize unnecessary:

* exposed ports;
* public services;
* inbound connectivity;
* unrestricted outbound connectivity;
* cross-environment communication.

Network boundaries SHOULD reinforce application and infrastructure security controls.

---

## Dependency and Supply Chain Security

Dependencies introduce external code into the FamilyOS trust model.

The architecture MUST therefore account for software supply chain risk.

Controls SHOULD include:

* dependency inventory;
* version pinning where appropriate;
* provenance verification;
* vulnerability analysis;
* integrity validation;
* controlled dependency updates;
* build reproducibility;
* artifact verification.

Dependency trust MUST NOT be assumed solely because a package exists in a public repository.

---

## Build Security

The build process forms part of the security architecture.

Build systems MUST protect:

* source integrity;
* dependency integrity;
* build configuration;
* generated artifacts;
* signing material;
* release metadata.

Security-sensitive build operations SHOULD produce verifiable evidence.

The Security Framework therefore integrates directly with EPIC-BLD-001 — Build Framework.

---

## Release Security

Security requirements MUST remain enforceable during release preparation and distribution.

Release security SHOULD verify:

* artifact provenance;
* test completion;
* security validation;
* dependency state;
* release authorization;
* version integrity;
* tag integrity;
* documentation completeness.

The Security Framework integrates with EPIC-REL-001 — Release Framework for release governance.

---

## Security Observability

Security architecture MUST provide sufficient visibility to identify relevant security events.

Security observability includes:

* authentication events;
* authorization failures;
* privilege changes;
* sensitive operations;
* policy violations;
* suspicious plugin behavior;
* integrity failures;
* configuration changes;
* secret access events;
* security control failures.

Security observability MUST integrate with the FamilyOS Observability Framework.

---

## Security Logging

Security logs MUST provide enough context to support investigation without unnecessarily exposing sensitive data.

Security events SHOULD include, where appropriate:

```text
Timestamp
Actor
Action
Resource
Decision
Security Context
Correlation Identifier
Result
```

Secrets MUST NOT appear in logs.

Highly sensitive data SHOULD be redacted, masked, or excluded.

---

## Audit Architecture

Auditability is required for important security operations.

Audit evidence SHOULD support reconstruction of:

* who performed an operation;
* what operation occurred;
* which resource was affected;
* when the operation occurred;
* whether it succeeded;
* which security decision allowed or denied it.

Audit records SHOULD be protected against unauthorized modification.

---

## Detection Architecture

FamilyOS SHOULD support detection of security-relevant anomalies.

Detection MAY include:

* repeated authentication failures;
* unexpected privilege escalation;
* unusual access patterns;
* unauthorized capability requests;
* suspicious plugin activity;
* integrity violations;
* abnormal configuration changes.

Detection mechanisms SHOULD produce actionable security events rather than uncontrolled volumes of noise.

---

## Security Failure Model

Security controls MUST fail safely.

When a security decision cannot be completed reliably, the preferred behavior is:

```text
Unknown Security State
        │
        ▼
Deny Sensitive Operation
        │
        ▼
Record Security Event
        │
        ▼
Return Controlled Error
```

Security failures MUST NOT silently downgrade protection.

---

## Failure Containment

Security architecture MUST attempt to limit the impact of compromised components.

Containment mechanisms MAY include:

* privilege boundaries;
* process isolation;
* plugin isolation;
* network segmentation;
* restricted credentials;
* scoped keys;
* resource limits;
* controlled shutdown;
* capability revocation.

The compromise of one component SHOULD NOT automatically compromise the entire FamilyOS environment.

---

## Secure Error Handling

Errors MUST NOT disclose unnecessary security-sensitive information.

External errors SHOULD avoid exposing:

* credentials;
* secrets;
* internal filesystem paths where sensitive;
* private cryptographic information;
* complete stack traces in inappropriate contexts;
* authorization internals that facilitate bypass attempts.

Detailed diagnostics MAY be retained in protected operational logs when required.

---

## Recovery Architecture

Security architecture MUST support recovery from security incidents.

Recovery mechanisms SHOULD include:

* credential revocation;
* key rotation;
* token invalidation;
* configuration restoration;
* artifact verification;
* trusted backup restoration;
* compromised component isolation;
* security state revalidation.

Recovery MUST restore both functionality and security guarantees.

---

## Backup Security

Backups MUST receive security protections appropriate to the data they contain.

Backup security SHOULD address:

* confidentiality;
* integrity;
* access control;
* retention;
* recovery validation;
* deletion.

A secure production environment MUST NOT be undermined by poorly protected backups.

---

## Security Control Placement

Controls SHOULD be positioned at the layer where they provide the strongest enforceable guarantee.

Example:

```text
Interface
   │
   ├── Input validation
   ▼
Application
   │
   ├── Authorization
   ▼
Domain
   │
   ├── Security invariants
   ▼
Repository
   │
   ├── Data access restrictions
   ▼
Storage
       └── Encryption / permissions
```

Duplicated controls MAY be appropriate when they provide meaningful defense in depth.

---

## Policy Enforcement Points

FamilyOS SHOULD define explicit Policy Enforcement Points.

Potential enforcement locations include:

* CLI boundaries;
* API boundaries;
* application services;
* capability dispatch;
* plugin runtime;
* repository access;
* external integration adapters;
* deployment workflows.

Policy decisions MUST be deterministic and auditable where security impact is significant.

---

## Policy Decision Architecture

A policy decision may follow:

```text
Actor
  +
Requested Operation
  +
Resource
  +
Context
  │
  ▼
Policy Decision Point
  │
  ▼
Policy Evaluation
  │
  ├────────► Allow
  │
  └────────► Deny
             │
             ▼
       Audit Evidence
```

Policy enforcement and policy decision responsibilities SHOULD remain clearly separated where practical.

---

## Security Architecture and Clean Architecture

FamilyOS follows Clean Architecture principles.

Security MUST respect architectural boundaries while remaining enforceable across layers.

A typical structure is:

```text
Interfaces
    │
    ▼
Application
    │
    ▼
Domain
    ▲
    │
Infrastructure
```

Security mechanisms MUST NOT introduce uncontrolled dependency inversion violations.

Infrastructure-specific security mechanisms SHOULD be accessed through defined abstractions when required by inner architectural layers.

---

## Security Architecture and DDD

Security rules SHOULD align with domain boundaries.

Domain-driven design supports security by making ownership and responsibility explicit.

Security policies MAY therefore be associated with:

* aggregates;
* entities;
* domain services;
* bounded contexts;
* application capabilities.

Security architecture MUST avoid creating a single unrestricted global security context that bypasses domain boundaries.

---

## Security Architecture and Plugins

The plugin architecture MUST integrate security through explicit contracts.

```text
Plugin
  │
  ▼
Plugin Manifest
  │
  ▼
Capability Declaration
  │
  ▼
Compliance Validation
  │
  ▼
Permission Evaluation
  │
  ▼
Runtime Registration
  │
  ▼
Controlled Execution
```

Plugin registration MUST NOT imply unrestricted execution authority.

---

## Security Architecture and Compliance

Security architecture MUST produce evidence that can be evaluated by the FamilyOS compliance mechanisms.

Relevant evidence MAY include:

* security test results;
* policy validation results;
* dependency reports;
* vulnerability findings;
* configuration validation;
* audit records;
* architecture reviews;
* release validation evidence.

The Security Framework therefore integrates with EPIC-PLUGIN-002 — Plugin Compliance Framework where plugin security is concerned.

---

## Security Architecture and Testing

Security controls MUST be testable.

Testing SHOULD cover:

* authentication;
* authorization;
* access denial;
* privilege boundaries;
* invalid input;
* policy enforcement;
* secret handling;
* plugin permissions;
* failure behavior;
* recovery mechanisms.

Security testing MUST integrate with EPIC-TST-001 — Testing Framework.

---

## Security Architecture and Quality

Security is a quality attribute of the FamilyOS platform.

Security architecture MUST therefore participate in:

* quality gates;
* validation;
* evidence collection;
* defect management;
* risk management;
* release decisions.

Security-related defects MUST be handled according to their risk and severity.

The architecture integrates with EPIC-QLT-001 — Quality Framework.

---

## Security Architecture and Documentation

Security architecture decisions MUST be documented sufficiently to remain understandable and auditable.

Documentation SHOULD capture:

* security boundaries;
* trust assumptions;
* controls;
* responsibilities;
* threat considerations;
* exceptions;
* architectural decisions.

Security documentation MUST follow EPIC-DOC-001 — Documentation Framework.

---

## Security Architecture and Observability

Security telemetry MUST use the common observability foundations of FamilyOS wherever possible.

The security architecture SHOULD reuse standardized:

* logging;
* metrics;
* tracing;
* correlation identifiers;
* event structures;
* evidence handling.

Security observability MUST NOT create an isolated monitoring architecture when the platform observability framework already provides suitable primitives.

---

## Security Architecture Governance

Material security architecture changes MUST be governed.

Changes MAY require:

* architecture review;
* security review;
* ADR creation;
* threat analysis;
* testing;
* compliance validation;
* documentation updates.

High-impact changes MUST NOT bypass established engineering governance.

---

## Security Architecture Review

Security architecture SHOULD be reviewed periodically and when significant changes occur.

Review triggers include:

* new trust boundaries;
* new authentication mechanisms;
* new authorization models;
* new plugin execution capabilities;
* new external integrations;
* new sensitive data categories;
* cryptographic changes;
* infrastructure changes;
* significant incidents.

Reviews SHOULD produce traceable outcomes.

---

## Architecture Exceptions

Security architecture exceptions MUST be explicit.

An exception MUST define:

* affected control;
* justification;
* scope;
* risk;
* compensating controls;
* owner;
* expiration or review condition.

Permanent undocumented security exceptions are prohibited.

---

## Security Architecture Evidence

Architecture compliance SHOULD be demonstrable through evidence.

Evidence MAY include:

```text
Architecture Documentation
        +
Threat Models
        +
Security Tests
        +
Policy Validation
        +
Compliance Reports
        +
Audit Records
        +
Release Evidence
```

Security claims SHOULD be supported by verifiable evidence rather than assumptions.

---

## Security Architecture Lifecycle

Security architecture evolves with the platform.

```text
Design
  │
  ▼
Threat Analysis
  │
  ▼
Implementation
  │
  ▼
Security Validation
  │
  ▼
Deployment
  │
  ▼
Observation
  │
  ▼
Review
  │
  ▼
Improvement
```

Security architecture MUST remain a continuous engineering responsibility.

---

## Architectural Security Invariants

The following invariants apply across FamilyOS:

1. authentication does not imply authorization;
2. authorization MUST be explicit for sensitive operations;
3. least privilege is the default privilege model;
4. secrets MUST NOT be stored in source code;
5. sensitive data MUST receive appropriate protection;
6. plugins MUST NOT automatically inherit unrestricted platform privileges;
7. security-relevant actions SHOULD be auditable;
8. security failures MUST fail safely;
9. production privileges MUST remain controlled;
10. security controls MUST be testable;
11. significant security decisions MUST be traceable;
12. security architecture MUST remain compatible with FamilyOS governance.

---

## Relationship With Other FamilyOS Frameworks

The Security Architecture operates as part of the broader FamilyOS engineering foundation.

```text
Engineering Foundation
        │
        ├── Documentation Framework
        ├── Testing Framework
        ├── Quality Framework
        ├── Build Framework
        ├── Release Framework
        ├── Observability Framework
        └── Security Framework
                │
                ▼
        Security Architecture
```

The Security Framework does not replace these foundations.

It defines the security responsibilities that integrate with them.

---

## Target Security Architecture

The target architecture for FamilyOS is:

## Expected Outcomes

The Security Architecture enables FamilyOS to achieve:

* explicit security boundaries;
* controlled trust relationships;
* consistent identity management;
* enforceable authorization;
* least-privilege execution;
* secure plugin extensibility;
* protected family data;
* governed cryptographic operations;
* secure secret handling;
* observable security behavior;
* auditable security decisions;
* contained security failures;
* recoverable security states;
* verifiable security compliance.

## Final Principle

FamilyOS security architecture is based on the following principle:

> Security must be structurally enforced across every trust boundary, capability, component, and lifecycle stage rather than assumed from the correctness of individual implementations.

The architecture established by this document provides the structural foundation upon which the remaining EPIC-SEC-001 security controls, mechanisms, governance processes, and validation requirements are built.
