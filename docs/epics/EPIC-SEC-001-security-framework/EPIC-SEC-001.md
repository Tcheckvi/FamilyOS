## Overview

EPIC-SEC-001 establishes the authoritative **FamilyOS Security Framework**.

The framework defines the principles, architecture, controls, trust boundaries, identity requirements, authorization model, data protection model, cryptographic expectations, threat and risk model, implementation requirements, automation strategy, compliance requirements, validation model, and release-security requirements used throughout FamilyOS.

Security is treated as a permanent engineering responsibility spanning:

```text
Architecture
    ↓
Implementation
    ↓
Testing
    ↓
Validation
    ↓
Build
    ↓
Release
    ↓
Runtime Operation
```

The framework is designed to make FamilyOS security:

* explicit;
* least-privilege;
* deny-by-default;
* threat-driven;
* evidence-based;
* data-protective;
* secret-safe;
* cryptographically sound;
* plugin-aware;
* observable;
* testable;
* automatable;
* governable.

---

## Historical Framework Model

EPIC-SEC-001 was originally authored using the historical compact framework documentation model.

The historical publication contained exactly:

```text
10 numbered documents
0 control documents
10 total files
```

The canonical numbered sequence was:

```text
00 → 09
```

This historical structure is intentional and SHALL remain preserved as part of the original publication record.

The absence of modern control documents in the historical release SHALL NOT be interpreted as corruption or incomplete publication.

---

## Historical Publication

Version `5.0.0` was historically published under:

```text
v5.0.0-security-framework
```

Historical publication commit:

```text
498fa16e692bf1461df2e4afba8bc4e485837a45
```

Historical publication state:

```text
Published
```

The historical release tag is immutable.

Post-release normalization SHALL NOT:

* move the historical tag;
* recreate the tag on a different commit;
* overwrite the tag;
* rewrite the historical release commit;
* represent a later normalization commit as the original publication.

---

## Historical Tag Object

The annotated historical tag is:

```text
v5.0.0-security-framework
```

The authoritative dereferenced tag target is:

```text
498fa16e692bf1461df2e4afba8bc4e485837a45
```

The local and authoritative remote tag SHALL continue to resolve to this commit.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of EPIC-SEC-001 is to establish the canonical FamilyOS security foundation.

The framework provides a common security model for:

* architecture;
* identities;
* authentication;
* authorization;
* permissions;
* data;
* secrets;
* cryptography;
* trust;
* threat analysis;
* risk;
* plugins;
* engineering controls;
* compliance;
* validation;
* release decisions;
* runtime security.

The framework enables FamilyOS to answer questions such as:

* Who or what is requesting access?
* How is identity established?
* What permissions apply?
* Which trust boundary is being crossed?
* Which data classification applies?
* Which secrets are involved?
* Which cryptographic guarantees are required?
* Which threats are relevant?
* Which risks remain?
* Which security controls apply?
* Which evidence proves that the controls work?
* Should the change be allowed to progress toward release?

---

## Security Problem Statement

FamilyOS handles information and capabilities that may become increasingly sensitive as the platform evolves.

Potential security concerns include:

* unauthorized access;
* excessive permissions;
* identity confusion;
* authentication bypass;
* authorization bypass;
* privilege escalation;
* insecure plugin behavior;
* secret exposure;
* insecure storage;
* insecure transport;
* cryptographic misuse;
* supply-chain compromise;
* dependency vulnerabilities;
* release-pipeline compromise;
* configuration errors;
* insufficient auditability;
* incomplete validation;
* ungoverned risk acceptance.

Without a common Security Framework, individual components could define security independently and create inconsistent or contradictory behavior.

EPIC-SEC-001 establishes shared security semantics for the entire FamilyOS engineering ecosystem.

---

## Security Principles

The framework is founded on the following core principles:

```text
Deny by Default
Least Privilege
Explicit Trust
Threat-Driven
Data-Protective
Secret-Safe
Cryptographically Sound
Plugin-Aware
Observable
Testable
Automatable
Vendor-Neutral
Proportional
```

These principles apply throughout the complete security lifecycle.

---

## Deny by Default

Access SHOULD be denied unless explicitly permitted.

The absence of an applicable authorization rule SHALL NOT normally grant access.

The preferred default is:

```text
Unknown
   ↓
Untrusted
   ↓
Denied
```

until sufficient security evidence establishes otherwise.

---

## Least Privilege

Subjects, services, plugins, automation, and operational identities SHOULD receive only the capabilities required for their legitimate responsibilities.

Privileges SHOULD be:

* explicit;
* scoped;
* reviewable;
* revocable;
* traceable.

---

## Explicit Trust

Trust SHALL NOT be inferred merely from location, naming, implementation origin, or prior behavior.

Trust decisions SHOULD be based on explicit security evidence.

Examples include:

* authenticated identity;
* verified plugin identity;
* signed artifacts;
* validated configuration;
* approved permissions;
* trusted provenance;
* governed exceptions.

---

## Threat-Driven Security

Security requirements SHOULD correspond to meaningful threats.

Threat modeling helps identify:

* protected assets;
* trust boundaries;
* threat actors;
* attack paths;
* misuse cases;
* security assumptions;
* mitigations;
* residual risk.

Security controls should solve identifiable security problems rather than exist only as ceremony.

---

## Data Protection

Data protection SHALL be proportional to sensitivity, value, and risk.

The framework establishes security expectations for:

* confidentiality;
* integrity;
* availability;
* minimization;
* retention;
* access control;
* encryption;
* auditability.

---

## Secret Safety

Secrets SHALL NOT be treated as ordinary configuration.

Examples include:

* passwords;
* tokens;
* API credentials;
* encryption keys;
* signing keys;
* private certificates;
* release credentials.

Secrets SHOULD be:

* isolated from source code;
* protected at rest;
* protected in transit;
* minimally distributed;
* revocable;
* rotated where appropriate;
* excluded from logs and release artifacts.

---

## Cryptographic Soundness

Cryptography SHALL use accepted algorithms, implementations, parameters, and key-management practices.

The framework discourages:

* custom cryptographic primitives;
* obsolete algorithms;
* hard-coded production keys;
* insecure random-number generation;
* uncontrolled key reuse;
* missing integrity protection.

---

## Plugin-Aware Security

Plugins are security-sensitive extension points.

Plugin security may involve:

* plugin identity;
* capabilities;
* permissions;
* isolation;
* dependency trust;
* provenance;
* configuration;
* data access;
* compliance;
* release validation.

Official plugin status SHALL NOT automatically bypass security controls.

---

## Security Observability

Security-relevant actions SHOULD generate sufficient structured evidence to support:

* troubleshooting;
* investigations;
* risk analysis;
* compliance;
* release decisions;
* operational monitoring.

Observability SHALL respect data-minimization and privacy constraints.

---

## Testable Security

Security requirements SHOULD be testable where practical.

Examples include:

* authorization tests;
* denied-path tests;
* malformed-input tests;
* secret-scanning tests;
* configuration validation;
* dependency checks;
* cryptographic-policy checks;
* plugin capability tests.

---

## Automatable Security

Repeatable security checks SHOULD be automated when reliable automation is practical.

Automation SHOULD produce structured evidence.

Automation SHALL NOT silently convert unresolved security findings into successful validation.

---

## Security Architecture

The Security Architecture defines how security responsibilities are distributed across FamilyOS.

Conceptually:

```text
Identity
   ↓
Authentication
   ↓
Authorization
   ↓
Policy
   ↓
Domain Enforcement
   ↓
Data / Capability Access
   ↓
Audit / Evidence
```

Security controls may exist at multiple boundaries.

---

## Identity

Identity answers:

```text
Who or what is this?
```

Identity may represent:

* a person;
* a family member;
* a service;
* a plugin;
* an automation process;
* an operational actor;
* a device;
* an external integration.

Identity SHALL remain distinguishable from authorization.

---

## Authentication

Authentication establishes confidence in an asserted identity.

Authentication mechanisms may include:

* passwords;
* tokens;
* certificates;
* device credentials;
* external identity providers;
* cryptographic proofs.

Authentication success alone SHALL NOT automatically grant unrestricted access.

---

## Authorization

Authorization determines whether an authenticated or otherwise identified subject may perform a specific action.

A simplified model is:

```text
Subject
   +
Action
   +
Resource
   +
Context
   ↓
Authorization Decision
```

Possible decisions may include:

```text
ALLOW
DENY
REQUIRE_ADDITIONAL_ASSURANCE
```

The exact executable model may evolve.

---

## Permissions

Permissions SHOULD use stable, explicit semantics.

A permission SHOULD identify a capability or operation rather than depend on ambiguous implicit meaning.

Permission semantics SHALL remain governed across:

* platform services;
* plugins;
* APIs;
* automation;
* operational tooling.

---

## Data Security

The Security Framework governs the protection of FamilyOS information.

Data security includes:

* classification;
* storage;
* access;
* transmission;
* retention;
* deletion;
* integrity;
* encryption;
* auditability.

Security measures SHOULD reflect actual sensitivity and risk.

---

## Secret Management

Secret-management architecture SHOULD provide controlled acquisition and use of sensitive credentials.

Applications SHOULD depend on secret-provider abstractions where appropriate rather than directly embedding secret-storage assumptions.

---

## Cryptography

Cryptographic requirements may apply to:

* data at rest;
* data in transit;
* signatures;
* checksums;
* tokens;
* credentials;
* release artifacts;
* provenance.

The framework integrates release cryptography with EPIC-REL-001.

---

## Threat Model

Threat modeling identifies possible security failures before they become implementation defects.

A threat model may describe:

```text
Asset
   ↓
Trust Boundary
   ↓
Threat
   ↓
Impact
   ↓
Likelihood
   ↓
Risk
   ↓
Control
   ↓
Residual Risk
```

Threat models SHOULD remain proportional to system criticality.

---

## Risk Model

Security risk reflects the likelihood and impact of undesirable security outcomes.

Risk may influence:

* design;
* testing;
* control selection;
* security reviews;
* release decisions;
* exception handling;
* operational monitoring.

Critical risks SHOULD normally block release or activation until remediated or explicitly governed.

---

## Trust Model

Trust boundaries define where security assumptions change.

Examples may include:

* user to application;
* plugin to platform;
* external integration to FamilyOS;
* build environment to release environment;
* release artifact to runtime;
* local system to remote service.

Crossing a trust boundary SHOULD trigger appropriate validation and authorization.

---

## Security Controls

Security controls implement or enforce security requirements.

Controls may be:

* preventive;
* detective;
* corrective;
* compensating.

A control SHOULD have sufficiently explicit:

* purpose;
* owner;
* applicability;
* implementation;
* validation method;
* evidence;
* status.

---

## Security Compliance

Compliance determines whether applicable security controls and requirements are satisfied.

Compliance may consume evidence from:

* tests;
* static validation;
* dependency analysis;
* configuration validation;
* policy validation;
* security review;
* release validation;
* runtime observability.

Compliance does not replace security architecture.

---

## Security Validation

Security validation determines whether applicable security requirements have been evaluated adequately.

Validation may occur at:

```text
Developer
   ↓
Pull Request
   ↓
Continuous Integration
   ↓
Build
   ↓
Release Candidate
   ↓
Release
   ↓
Runtime
```

Validation SHOULD remain proportional to change scope and risk.

---

## Security Evidence

Security decisions SHOULD rely on trustworthy evidence.

Evidence may include:

* test results;
* policy-validation results;
* dependency findings;
* secret-scan results;
* artifact checksums;
* provenance;
* control assessments;
* security review outcomes;
* release-gate results.

Absence of required evidence SHALL NOT automatically be interpreted as success.

---

## Release Security

Security validation integrates with EPIC-REL-001 — Release Framework.

Conceptually:

```text
Release Candidate
        ↓
Quality Evidence
        ↓
Security Validation
        ↓
Security Release Gate
        ↓
Release Authorization
        ↓
FamilyOS Release
```

Security SHALL NOT create a competing independent release lifecycle.

---

## Security Release Gates

Release security gates may consider:

* unresolved critical vulnerabilities;
* authorization defects;
* secret exposure;
* insecure cryptography;
* dependency risk;
* plugin-security failures;
* missing evidence;
* artifact integrity;
* release-pipeline trust.

A mandatory gate failure SHOULD normally prevent ordinary release progression.

---

## Security Exceptions

Exceptions SHALL remain explicit.

An exception SHOULD identify:

* affected requirement;
* justification;
* risk;
* owner;
* approval;
* scope;
* expiration or review expectation.

An exception SHALL NOT rewrite historical evidence to make a failed check appear successful.

---

## Framework Relationships

EPIC-SEC-001 depends on and integrates with other FamilyOS engineering frameworks.

Important relationships include:

```text
Engineering Foundation
        ↓
Testing Framework
        ↓
Quality Framework
        ↓
Build Framework
        ↓
Release Framework
        ↓
Observability Framework
        ↓
Security Framework
```

The relationship is conceptual rather than ownership inheritance.

Each framework retains its own responsibilities.

---

## Testing Boundary

EPIC-TST-001 owns testing architecture and testing practices.

Security defines security-specific requirements and consumes testing capabilities.

---

## Quality Boundary

EPIC-QLT-001 owns the general quality model, quality evidence, quality gates, metrics, and quality governance.

Security findings may become Quality Framework evidence.

---

## Build Boundary

EPIC-BLD-001 owns build execution, build environments, dependency preparation, artifact production, and Build Evidence.

Security applies security constraints to build and supply-chain behavior.

---

## Release Boundary

EPIC-REL-001 owns the canonical release lifecycle and publication model.

Security provides release-security requirements and gates.

---

## Observability Boundary

EPIC-OBS-001 owns the general observability framework.

Security consumes observability capabilities for security evidence and operational detection.

---

## Plugin Compliance Boundary

EPIC-PLUGIN-002 owns plugin compliance semantics.

Security defines security controls applicable to plugins.

Plugin compliance may consume security requirements and security evidence.

---

## Canonical Historical Documents

The historical framework consists of:

```text
00-EPIC.md
01-Context-and-Vision.md
02-Security-Principles.md
03-Security-Architecture.md
04-Identity-Authentication-and-Authorization.md
05-Data-Secrets-and-Cryptography.md
06-Threat-Risk-and-Trust-Model.md
07-Security-Controls-and-Compliance.md
08-Implementation-and-Automation.md
09-Validation-and-Release.md
```

Historical count:

```text
10 numbered documents
```

---

## Current Control Documents

The normalized current repository representation adds:

```text
EPIC-SEC-001.md
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

Control count:

```text
7 control documents
```

Current canonical repository representation:

```text
10 numbered documents
+
7 control documents
=
17 canonical files
```

---

## Historical vs Current Structure

The distinction SHALL remain explicit.

Historical publication:

```text
Numbered Documents: 10
Control Documents:    0
Total Files:         10
```

Current normalized repository:

```text
Numbered Documents: 10
Control Documents:    7
Canonical Files:     17
```

The current structure SHALL NOT be retroactively attributed to the historical release.

---

## Post-Release Normalization

The current activity introduces the standard FamilyOS control-document model around the historically published Security Framework.

Normalization may establish:

* machine-readable EPIC metadata;
* canonical repository inventory;
* validation evidence;
* revision history;
* changelog;
* framework navigation;
* current lifecycle state.

Normalization SHALL preserve historical publication truth.

---

## Current Revalidation

The normalized representation requires evidence-based revalidation.

Required validation includes:

* YAML parsing;
* YAML contract;
* filesystem inventory;
* numbered-document integrity;
* control-document integrity;
* empty-file validation;
* manifest synchronization;
* active-state consistency;
* reference validation;
* placeholder validation;
* malformed join validation;
* security architecture consistency;
* identity/authentication/authorization consistency;
* data/secrets/cryptography consistency;
* threat/risk/trust consistency;
* controls/compliance consistency;
* framework-boundary consistency;
* historical tag integrity;
* Ruff;
* MyPy;
* Pytest;
* Git diff validation.

---

## Evidence Rule

The revalidation model is:

```text
Execute
    ↓
Observe
    ↓
Evaluate
    ↓
Record
```

The prohibited model is:

```text
Requirement Exists
    ↓
Assume Success
    ↓
Record PASS
```

Only actual evidence may convert pending validation state to validated state.

---
