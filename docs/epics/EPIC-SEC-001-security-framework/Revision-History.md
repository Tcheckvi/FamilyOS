# EPIC-SEC-001 — Security Framework Revision History

## Document Purpose

This document records the evolution of **EPIC-SEC-001 — Security Framework**.

It preserves the historical publication of version `5.0.0` while documenting the later normalization of the repository into the current FamilyOS EPIC control model.

The revision history distinguishes between:

* historical framework publication;
* historical compact documentation structure;
* immutable release identity;
* later control-document normalization;
* current repository revalidation;
* future framework evolution.

## 1. Revision Principles

The Security Framework revision history follows several foundational principles.

### Historical Integrity

Historical publication state SHALL remain identifiable and immutable.

The release tag:

```text
v5.0.0-security-framework
```

SHALL remain attached to:

```text
498fa16e692bf1461df2e4afba8bc4e485837a45
```

Later normalization commits SHALL NOT replace that historical publication identity.

---

### Explicit Evolution

Material changes to the Security Framework SHOULD remain traceable.

This includes changes affecting:

* security principles;
* security architecture;
* identity;
* authentication;
* authorization;
* permissions;
* data protection;
* secrets;
* cryptography;
* threat modeling;
* risk;
* trust;
* controls;
* compliance;
* security automation;
* validation;
* release integration.

---

### Evidence-Based Validation

Validation state SHALL follow evidence.

A requirement SHALL NOT be marked `PASS` merely because it is documented.

The expected sequence is:

```text
Execute
    ↓
Observe
    ↓
Evaluate
    ↓
Record
```

---

### Structural Truth

The repository history SHALL preserve the difference between:

```text
Historical Published Structure
```

and:

```text
Current Normalized Structure
```

The current seven control documents SHALL NOT be retroactively attributed to the historical version `5.0.0` publication.

---

## 2. Framework Version

The historically published Security Framework version is:

```text
5.0.0
```

This version is part of the historical framework identity.

Post-release repository normalization does not by itself require a new framework semantic version when the normative Security Framework content remains unchanged.

---

## 3. Framework Version vs Repository History

Framework version:

```text
5.0.0
```

Historical release tag:

```text
v5.0.0-security-framework
```

Historical release commit:

```text
498fa16e692bf1461df2e4afba8bc4e485837a45
```

A later repository normalization commit may have a different Git identity while the framework remains version `5.0.0`.

---

## 4. Historical Documentation Model

The original Security Framework used the compact FamilyOS framework documentation model.

Historical structure:

```text
Canonical Range:       00 → 09
Numbered Documents:    10
Control Documents:      0
Historical Files:      10
```

The historical release therefore consisted only of the ten numbered framework documents.

---

## 5. Historical Numbered Documents

The historical release contained:

```text
00-EPIC.md
01-Context-and-Vision.md
02-Security-Principles.md
03-Security-Architecture.md
04-Identity-Authentication-and-Authorization.md
05-Data-Secrets-and-Cryptography.md
06-Threat-Risk-and-Trust-Model.md
07-Security-Controls-and-Compliance.md
08-Implementation-and-Automation.md
09-Validation-and-Release.md
```

These documents form the historical normative framework baseline.

---

## 6. Historical Publication

EPIC-SEC-001 version `5.0.0` was historically published under:

```text
v5.0.0-security-framework
```

Historical publication commit:

```text
498fa16e692bf1461df2e4afba8bc4e485837a45
```

Historical publication status:

```text
Published
```

Historical tag policy:

```text
Immutable
```

---

## 7. Historical Tag Evidence

The historical tag exists as an annotated Git tag.

Its dereferenced target is:

```text
498fa16e692bf1461df2e4afba8bc4e485837a45
```

The authoritative remote was also observed to resolve the historical tag to the same commit.

This relationship SHALL remain unchanged through normalization.

---

## 8. Historical Tag Immutability

Post-release normalization SHALL NOT:

* move `v5.0.0-security-framework`;
* delete and recreate it on another commit;
* force-update it;
* rewrite its publication commit;
* claim a later correction commit as the original release;
* reinterpret later control documents as historical release content.

---

## 9. Security Framework Foundation

Version `5.0.0` established the canonical FamilyOS Security Framework.

The release defines:

* Security Principles;
* Security Architecture;
* Identity;
* Authentication;
* Authorization;
* Data Protection;
* Secret Management;
* Cryptography;
* Threat Modeling;
* Risk Management;
* Trust Boundaries;
* Security Controls;
* Compliance;
* Implementation Direction;
* Security Automation;
* Validation;
* Release Security.

---

## 10. Security Principles Revision

Version `5.0.0` establishes the following foundational principles:

```text
Deny by Default
Least Privilege
Explicit Trust
Threat-Driven
Data-Protective
Secret-Safe
Cryptographically Sound
Plugin-Aware
Observable
Testable
Automatable
Vendor-Neutral
Proportional
```

These principles represent the foundational normative security posture.

---

## 11. Deny-by-Default Revision

The framework establishes deny-by-default behavior.

The absence of a valid applicable authorization rule SHOULD normally result in denial.

Conceptually:

```text
Unknown
   ↓
Untrusted
   ↓
Denied
```

---

## 12. Least-Privilege Revision

The framework establishes least privilege for:

* users;
* family members;
* services;
* plugins;
* automation;
* operational identities.

Privileges SHOULD remain explicit, scoped, reviewable, and revocable.

---

## 13. Explicit Trust Revision

Trust SHALL rely on explicit evidence rather than implicit assumptions.

Examples include:

* authenticated identity;
* approved authorization;
* validated provenance;
* trusted configuration;
* governed permissions;
* signed artifacts.

---

## 14. Identity Revision

The framework establishes identity as a first-class concept.

Identity may represent:

* people;
* services;
* plugins;
* devices;
* automation;
* integrations;
* operational actors.

Identity SHALL remain distinct from authentication and authorization.

---

## 15. Authentication Revision

Authentication establishes confidence in an asserted identity.

Version `5.0.0` explicitly avoids equating authentication success with unrestricted permission.

---

## 16. Authorization Revision

Authorization determines whether an identified subject may perform an operation.

Conceptually:

```text
Subject
   +
Action
   +
Resource
   +
Context
   ↓
Authorization Decision
```

Authorization SHALL remain explicit and governable.

---

## 17. Data Protection Revision

Version `5.0.0` establishes security expectations for:

* confidentiality;
* integrity;
* access control;
* classification;
* minimization;
* retention;
* encryption;
* auditability.

---

## 18. Secret Management Revision

Secrets are treated as security-sensitive objects distinct from ordinary configuration.

Examples include:

* passwords;
* API credentials;
* tokens;
* private keys;
* encryption keys;
* signing keys;
* release credentials.

---

## 19. Cryptography Revision

The framework establishes expectations for sound cryptographic engineering.

It favors:

* established algorithms;
* trusted implementations;
* sound key management;
* secure randomness;
* appropriate integrity protection.

Custom cryptographic primitives are discouraged.

---

## 20. Threat Model Revision

Version `5.0.0` establishes threat modeling as a permanent security-design mechanism.

Conceptually:

```text
Asset
  ↓
Threat
  ↓
Attack Path
  ↓
Impact
  ↓
Likelihood
  ↓
Risk
  ↓
Control
  ↓
Residual Risk
```

---

## 21. Risk Revision

Security risk influences:

* architecture;
* implementation;
* testing;
* security controls;
* validation;
* release decisions;
* exception handling;
* runtime monitoring.

Critical unresolved risk SHOULD normally prevent ordinary release progression.

---

## 22. Trust Model Revision

The framework establishes explicit trust boundaries.

Examples include:

```text
User → Application
Plugin → Platform
External Integration → FamilyOS
Build Environment → Release Environment
Artifact → Runtime
Service → Protected Data
```

---

## 23. Security Control Revision

Security controls may be:

```text
Preventive
Detective
Corrective
Compensating
```

A control SHOULD identify:

* requirement;
* purpose;
* applicability;
* owner;
* implementation;
* evidence;
* validation method.

---

## 24. Compliance Revision

Security compliance is defined as evidence-based evaluation of applicable requirements and controls.

Compliance SHALL NOT treat documentation intent alone as proof that a control is effective.

---

## 25. Implementation Revision

The framework provides implementation direction without binding FamilyOS to a single security vendor or toolchain.

Implementation areas may include:

* authentication services;
* authorization services;
* policy engines;
* secret providers;
* cryptographic utilities;
* security validation services;
* plugin security.

---

## 26. Automation Revision

Security automation may include:

* secret scanning;
* dependency analysis;
* policy validation;
* configuration validation;
* permission validation;
* security tests;
* artifact verification;
* release gates.

Automation SHALL expose failures rather than silently convert them into success.

---

## 27. Plugin Security Revision

Plugins are treated as important trust boundaries.

Security considerations include:

* identity;
* permissions;
* capabilities;
* provenance;
* dependencies;
* data access;
* execution boundaries;
* compliance.

Official plugin status SHALL NOT imply unrestricted trust.

---

## 28. Validation Revision

Security validation is evidence-based.

Potential evidence includes:

* authorization tests;
* authentication tests;
* denied-path tests;
* dependency findings;
* secret-scan results;
* policy results;
* configuration checks;
* artifact integrity;
* provenance;
* security reviews.

---

## 29. Release Security Revision

The framework integrates security with the FamilyOS Release Framework.

Conceptually:

```text
Release Candidate
        ↓
Security Validation
        ↓
Security Evidence
        ↓
Security Gate
        ↓
Release Decision
```

EPIC-REL-001 remains authoritative for the general release lifecycle.

---

## 30. Testing Boundary Revision

EPIC-TST-001 remains authoritative for general testing architecture.

Security defines security-specific testing requirements and consumes Testing Framework capabilities.

---

## 31. Quality Boundary Revision

EPIC-QLT-001 remains authoritative for quality governance and general quality-gate semantics.

Security findings may become quality evidence.

---

## 32. Build Boundary Revision

EPIC-BLD-001 remains authoritative for build engineering.

Security adds constraints related to:

* dependency trust;
* build credentials;
* build-environment trust;
* artifact integrity;
* provenance;
* supply-chain security.

---

## 33. Release Boundary Revision

EPIC-REL-001 owns release lifecycle semantics.

EPIC-SEC-001 provides security requirements and evidence consumed by release decisions.

---

## 34. Observability Boundary Revision

EPIC-OBS-001 remains authoritative for general observability.

Security may consume observability evidence for:

* investigation;
* authentication failures;
* authorization failures;
* runtime policy failures;
* suspicious activity;
* compliance.

---

## 35. Plugin Compliance Boundary Revision

EPIC-PLUGIN-002 remains authoritative for plugin compliance.

Security requirements may become plugin compliance criteria.

---

## 36. Post-Release Governance Evolution

After the publication of version `5.0.0`, the FamilyOS framework governance model evolved.

Later normalized frameworks use a standard seven-document control layer:

```text
EPIC-<ID>.md
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

EPIC-SEC-001 did not contain this layer in its historical publication.

---

## 37. Post-Release Normalization

The current normalization adds:

```text
EPIC-SEC-001.md
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

These control documents improve:

* machine-readable metadata;
* structural inventory;
* navigation;
* validation evidence;
* revision tracking;
* lifecycle visibility;
* historical-publication clarity.

---

## 38. Current Repository Structure

The normalized current repository contains:

```text
10 numbered documents
+
7 control documents
=
17 canonical files
```

Current canonical range remains:

```text
00 → 09
```

---

## 39. Historical vs Current Structure

Historical release:

```text
Numbered Documents: 10
Control Documents:    0
Historical Files:    10
```

Current normalized repository:

```text
Numbered Documents: 10
Control Documents:    7
Canonical Files:     17
```

The second state SHALL NOT be attributed retroactively to the first.

---

## 40. Machine-Readable Normalization

The current normalization introduces:

```text
EPIC.yaml
```

as the machine-readable framework contract.

It records:

* EPIC identity;
* framework version;
* status;
* scope;
* deliverables;
* structure;
* historical structure;
* validation state;
* publication identity;
* closure state.

---

## 41. Manifest Normalization

The normalization introduces:

```text
MANIFEST.md
```

as the canonical repository inventory.

It establishes the current expected seventeen-file repository structure.

---

## 42. Validation Normalization

The normalization introduces:

```text
VALIDATION.md
```

as the authoritative record for current revalidation evidence.

It distinguishes historical publication evidence from current repository evidence.

---

## 43. Changelog Normalization

The normalization introduces:

```text
CHANGELOG.md
```

to preserve:

* historical `5.0.0` publication;
* later repository normalization;
* future security-framework revisions.

---

## 44. README Normalization

The normalization introduces:

```text
README.md
```

as the human-readable navigation layer.

It does not replace the normative numbered framework documents.

---

## 45. EPIC Control Summary

The normalization introduces:

```text
EPIC-SEC-001.md
```

as the consolidated control-level summary of the framework.

---

## 46. Current Validation State

Current revalidation state:

```text
Repository Validation: Validated
Final Revalidation:     Validated
```

This state SHALL remain pending until actual repository validation evidence is recorded.

---

## 47. Current Revalidation Scope

The current revalidation includes:

```text
YAML Parse
YAML Contract
Filesystem Contract
Numbering Integrity
Control Document Integrity
Empty File Validation
Manifest Synchronization
README Synchronization
EPIC Summary Synchronization
Changelog Synchronization
Revision History Synchronization
State Consistency
Reference Integrity
Placeholder Validation
Join Defect Validation
Security Principle Consistency
Security Architecture Consistency
Identity / Authentication / Authorization Consistency
Data / Secrets / Cryptography Consistency
Threat / Risk / Trust Consistency
Security Controls / Compliance Consistency
Framework Boundaries
Historical Tag Integrity
Ruff
MyPy
Pytest
Diff Check
Remote Branch Verification
Final Repository Cleanliness
```

---

## 48. Validation Evidence Policy

The required validation sequence is:

```text
Execute
    ↓
Observe
    ↓
Evaluate
    ↓
Record
```

Historical validation evidence does not automatically prove the current normalized repository state.

---

## 49. Historical Evidence Already Observed

The following historical evidence has already been observed:

```text
Historical Tag Exists:       PASS
Annotated Tag:               PASS
Historical Commit Identified: PASS
Remote Historical Tag:       PASS
Historical Tag Resolution:   PASS
Historical File Count:       PASS — 10
Historical Control Count:    PASS — 0
```

These findings describe the historical publication only.

---

## 50. Current Repository Evidence

Current repository validation evidence remains to be collected after all seven control documents are present and synchronized.

Until then:

```text
Repository Validation: Validated
Final Revalidation:     Validated
```

---

## 51. Revision Classification

Future Security Framework changes may be classified as follows.

### Editorial

Examples:

* spelling;
* grammar;
* formatting;
* non-semantic wording correction.

Expected version impact:

```text
Usually none
```

---

### Repository Normalization

Examples:

* control-document addition;
* metadata synchronization;
* manifest normalization;
* validation-record normalization;
* active-state correction.

Expected version impact:

```text
Usually none
```

when normative framework semantics remain unchanged.

---

### Compatible Semantic Change

Examples:

* compatible new control category;
* compatible evidence extension;
* compatible security profile;
* additional optional security metadata.

Potential version impact:

```text
MINOR
```

subject to FamilyOS release governance.

---

### Breaking Semantic Change

Examples:

* incompatible authorization model;
* incompatible security policy semantics;
* incompatible trust model;
* incompatible mandatory control behavior;
* incompatible release-security contract.

Potential version impact:

```text
MAJOR
```

subject to governance.

---

## 52. Historical State Policy

Historical lifecycle states may remain when clearly identified as historical.

Examples may include:

```text
Ready for Final Validation
Target Release
Implementation Pending
```

if they appear within the historical document as evidence of its pre-publication state.

They SHALL NOT be interpreted as the current control-document lifecycle state after publication.

---

## 53. Current State Policy

Current control documents SHALL distinguish:

```text
Historical Framework Publication
```

from:

```text
Current Repository Revalidation
```

The historical publication is already complete.

Only current repository revalidation remains pending.

---

## 54. Historical `00-EPIC.md` State

The historical `00-EPIC.md` records:

```text
Canonical Documents: 10
Target Release: v5.0.0-security-framework
Implementation Status: Pending
Framework Status: Ready for Final Validation
```

These statements represent the state of the document at the time of the historical release process.

They SHALL remain preserved unless a later explicit normalization decision governs modification of the historical numbered document.

The new control layer provides the current lifecycle truth without rewriting historical evidence prematurely.

---

## 55. Current Control State

The normalized control state is:

```text
Framework Version:       5.0.0
Historical Publication:  Published
Historical Tag:          v5.0.0-security-framework
Historical Commit:       498fa16e692bf1461df2e4afba8bc4e485837a45

Current Activity:         Post-Release Revalidation
Repository Validation:   Validated
Final Revalidation:      Validated
```

---

## 56. Repository Completion Conditions

Current normalization becomes technically complete when:

* all seventeen files exist;
* all ten numbered documents remain intact;
* all seven control documents exist;
* YAML parsing passes;
* filesystem contract passes;
* numbering passes;
* manifest synchronization passes;
* references pass;
* placeholders pass;
* security semantic reviews pass;
* Ruff passes;
* MyPy passes;
* Pytest passes;
* `git diff --check` passes;
* historical tag integrity is re-confirmed.

---

## 57. Post-Release Correction Conditions

The normalization workflow becomes fully complete when:

* normalization files are staged;
* staged content is validated;
* correction commit is created;
* repository quality gates pass after commit;
* correction commit is pushed;
* authoritative remote branch matches local HEAD;
* historical tag remains unchanged locally and remotely;
* working tree is clean.

---

## 58. Future Security Framework Evolution

Future revisions may introduce:

* executable security policies;
* machine-readable security profiles;
* formal permission schemas;
* authorization policy engines;
* advanced threat-model formats;
* risk-scoring models;
* control catalogs;
* compliance automation;
* security attestations;
* signing;
* artifact provenance validation;
* advanced secret-provider integrations;
* security incident-response integration;
* continuous runtime security validation.

Future revisions SHALL preserve historical version `5.0.0` publication evidence.

---

## 59. Current Revision State

```text
EPIC:                    EPIC-SEC-001
Framework:               Security Framework
Framework Version:       5.0.0

Historical Publication:  Published
Historical Tag:          v5.0.0-security-framework
Historical Commit:       498fa16e692bf1461df2e4afba8bc4e485837a45
Historical Tag Policy:   Immutable

Historical Structure:
Canonical Range:         00 → 09
Numbered Documents:      10
Control Documents:        0
Historical Files:        10

Current Structure:
Canonical Range:         00 → 09
Numbered Documents:      10
Control Documents:        7
Canonical Files:         17

Current Activity:         Post-Release Revalidation
Repository Validation:   Validated
Final Revalidation:      Validated
```

---

## 60. Current Validation Evidence Status

Historical publication evidence has been established.

Current normalized repository evidence remains pending.

The authoritative current validation evidence belongs in:

```text
VALIDATION.md
```

Until current evidence is complete, this revision history SHALL NOT claim final repository revalidation success.

---

## 61. Final Revision Principle

EPIC-SEC-001 version `5.0.0` established the canonical FamilyOS Security Framework.

Its historical publication consists of:

```text
10 numbered documents
0 control documents
10 historical files
```

under:

```text
v5.0.0-security-framework
```

at:

```text
498fa16e692bf1461df2e4afba8bc4e485837a45
```

The current repository normalization adds seven control documents without rewriting that history.

Future framework evolution SHALL preserve:

* deny by default;
* least privilege;
* explicit trust;
* identity separation;
* authorization integrity;
* protected data;
* secret safety;
* cryptographic soundness;
* threat-driven engineering;
* risk governance;
* explicit trust boundaries;
* evidence-based controls;
* historical release integrity.
