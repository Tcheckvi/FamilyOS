# Security Framework

## EPIC-SEC-001

## 04 Identity, Authentication and Authorization

### Overview

Identity, authentication, and authorization form the primary access-control foundation of the FamilyOS Security Framework.

FamilyOS manages sensitive family information, platform capabilities, plugins, services, integrations, devices, and administrative operations. Every security-sensitive interaction therefore requires a reliable mechanism for determining:

* who or what is acting;
* whether the claimed identity can be trusted;
* what that identity is permitted to do;
* which resources may be accessed;
* under which conditions access remains valid;
* how access decisions can be reviewed and audited.

Identity establishes the security principal.

Authentication verifies the principal.

Authorization determines the operations that the authenticated principal may perform.

These responsibilities MUST remain logically distinct.

Authentication MUST NOT automatically imply authorization.

Authorization MUST NOT be granted without a sufficiently established identity when identity is required by the operation.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to establish the FamilyOS architecture and requirements for:

* identity management;
* security principals;
* authentication;
* credentials;
* sessions;
* authorization;
* permissions;
* roles;
* capabilities;
* resource ownership;
* policy evaluation;
* privilege management;
* service identities;
* plugin identities;
* device identities;
* external identities;
* access revocation;
* access auditing.

The objective is to provide a consistent and extensible access-control model across the entire FamilyOS ecosystem.

---

## Security Objectives

The FamilyOS identity and access architecture MUST support the following objectives:

1. uniquely identify security-relevant actors;
2. authenticate identities using appropriate mechanisms;
3. prevent unauthorized access;
4. enforce least privilege;
5. separate authentication from authorization;
6. support explicit permissions and capabilities;
7. protect credentials and authentication material;
8. support revocation;
9. prevent privilege escalation;
10. provide auditable access decisions;
11. support human and non-human identities;
12. remain compatible with FamilyOS domain and plugin architecture.

Identity and access controls MUST be enforceable independently of presentation-layer restrictions.

---

## Identity, Authentication and Authorization Model

The core access-control flow is:

```text
Actor
  │
  ▼
Identity Claim
  │
  ▼
Authentication
  │
  ▼
Authenticated Principal
  │
  ▼
Authorization Request
  │
  ▼
Policy / Permission Evaluation
  │
  ├────────────► Deny
  │
  ▼
Allow
  │
  ▼
Protected Operation
  │
  ▼
Security Audit Event
```

Each stage represents a distinct security responsibility.

Failure at a required stage MUST prevent execution of the protected operation.

---

## Identity Model

An identity represents a security-relevant actor recognized by FamilyOS.

Identities MAY represent:

* family members;
* users;
* administrators;
* applications;
* services;
* plugins;
* devices;
* integrations;
* automation processes;
* system components.

Every identity used for security decisions MUST be represented by a stable identifier.

Display names MUST NOT be used as authoritative security identifiers.

---

## Security Principals

A security principal is an identity capable of participating in an authenticated or authorized operation.

Examples include:

```text
Person
Family Member
Administrator
Service
Plugin
Device
Integration
Automation
System Process
```

Security principals MUST be distinguishable from ordinary domain entities when their security responsibilities differ.

A domain entity MAY correspond to a security principal without becoming responsible for authentication implementation details.

---

## Principal Identifier

Each security principal MUST have a stable identifier.

The identifier SHOULD be:

* unique within its security scope;
* immutable whenever practical;
* independent of display names;
* suitable for audit records;
* safe for internal reference.

Changing a person's name, email address, or other mutable profile attribute MUST NOT silently create a new security identity unless explicitly intended.

---

## Identity Attributes

An identity MAY contain security-relevant attributes.

Examples include:

```text
principal_id
principal_type
family_id
status
roles
permissions
capabilities
authentication_state
security_context
created_at
disabled_at
```

Security decisions MUST use only trusted attributes.

Unverified user-supplied attributes MUST NOT be treated as authoritative authorization information.

---

## Identity Lifecycle

Identity security applies throughout the complete identity lifecycle.

```text
Provision
   │
   ▼
Activate
   │
   ▼
Authenticate
   │
   ▼
Authorize
   │
   ▼
Maintain
   │
   ▼
Suspend
   │
   ▼
Revoke / Disable
   │
   ▼
Archive / Delete
```

Each lifecycle transition MUST preserve security invariants.

---

## Identity Provisioning

Identity creation MUST be controlled.

Provisioning SHOULD establish:

* principal identifier;
* principal type;
* initial status;
* family association where applicable;
* initial roles;
* initial permissions;
* authentication requirements;
* ownership information.

New identities MUST NOT receive unnecessary privileges by default.

---

## Identity Activation

Provisioned identities SHOULD remain inactive until required activation conditions have been satisfied.

Activation MAY require:

* credential establishment;
* identity verification;
* administrator approval;
* invitation acceptance;
* family membership validation;
* device verification;
* external identity verification.

Activation MUST NOT implicitly grant privileges beyond those explicitly assigned.

---

## Identity Suspension

FamilyOS MUST support temporary identity suspension where applicable.

A suspended identity SHOULD be prevented from initiating new protected operations.

Suspension MAY occur because of:

* suspected compromise;
* policy violation;
* administrative action;
* repeated authentication failures;
* temporary account restriction;
* incident response.

Suspension SHOULD be reversible without requiring creation of a new identity.

---

## Identity Revocation

Identity access MUST be revocable.

Revocation SHOULD invalidate, where applicable:

* active sessions;
* authentication tokens;
* refresh tokens;
* delegated permissions;
* temporary privileges;
* plugin credentials;
* service credentials.

Revocation MUST take effect within a security-appropriate timeframe.

---

## Authentication

Authentication verifies that an actor is entitled to operate as a claimed identity.

Authentication answers:

> Can FamilyOS sufficiently trust that this actor represents this principal?

Authentication MUST occur before authorization whenever an operation requires an authenticated principal.

---

## Authentication Factors

Authentication factors generally belong to categories such as:

```text
Something the actor knows
Something the actor possesses
Something inherent to the actor
Something established cryptographically
```

Examples MAY include:

* passwords;
* passphrases;
* security keys;
* device credentials;
* one-time codes;
* cryptographic keys;
* trusted identity-provider assertions.

Authentication strength SHOULD reflect operation sensitivity.

---

## Authentication Assurance

Not every authentication mechanism provides the same assurance.

FamilyOS SHOULD distinguish authentication assurance levels where appropriate.

Example:

```text
Low-Risk Operation
       │
       ▼
Standard Authentication

Sensitive Operation
       │
       ▼
Strong Authentication

Critical Operation
       │
       ▼
Strong Authentication
       +
Additional Verification
```

Higher-risk operations MAY require re-authentication or stronger verification.

---

## Multi-Factor Authentication

FamilyOS SHOULD support multi-factor authentication for security-sensitive identities and operations where technically appropriate.

Multi-factor authentication combines independent authentication factors.

Compromise of one factor SHOULD NOT automatically compromise the complete authentication mechanism.

Administrative and highly privileged identities SHOULD use stronger authentication controls than ordinary low-risk identities.

---

## Credential Security

Authentication credentials are security-sensitive assets.

Credentials MUST be protected throughout their lifecycle.

Credential security includes:

* creation;
* transmission;
* storage;
* validation;
* rotation;
* recovery;
* revocation;
* destruction.

Credentials MUST NOT be stored in plaintext when a secure alternative exists.

---

## Password Security

Where passwords are supported, FamilyOS MUST apply secure password handling.

Passwords MUST NOT be stored directly.

Password storage MUST use an approved password-hashing mechanism with appropriate parameters.

Password handling SHOULD support:

* adequate password length;
* protection against common credential attacks;
* secure reset procedures;
* controlled authentication failure handling;
* secure password change mechanisms.

Application logs MUST NOT contain passwords.

---

## Credential Transmission

Credentials transmitted across a network MUST be protected by secure transport.

Credentials MUST NOT be intentionally exposed through:

* URLs;
* logs;
* command history where avoidable;
* analytics;
* diagnostic traces;
* error messages.

Credential transmission SHOULD minimize unnecessary intermediaries.

---

## Authentication Failure Handling

Authentication failures MUST be handled securely.

The system SHOULD avoid exposing unnecessary information about whether:

* an identity exists;
* a password was correct;
* a particular authentication factor failed;
* internal account state differs.

Failure responses SHOULD provide sufficient usability without facilitating account enumeration or attack optimization.

---

## Brute-Force Protection

Authentication systems SHOULD include controls against repeated automated attempts.

Controls MAY include:

* rate limiting;
* progressive delays;
* temporary restrictions;
* risk-based verification;
* security alerts;
* additional authentication requirements.

Protection mechanisms MUST avoid creating trivial denial-of-service paths against legitimate users.

---

## Session Architecture

Successful authentication MAY establish a security session.

A session represents a bounded period during which previously established authentication state can be reused.

```text
Authentication
      │
      ▼
Session Creation
      │
      ▼
Session Identifier / Token
      │
      ▼
Authorized Requests
      │
      ▼
Expiration / Revocation
```

Sessions MUST have explicit lifecycle rules.

---

## Session Security

Sessions SHOULD define:

* creation time;
* principal identity;
* authentication assurance;
* expiration;
* inactivity timeout where applicable;
* revocation state;
* relevant security context.

Session identifiers MUST be sufficiently unpredictable.

Sensitive operations MAY require fresh authentication even when a valid session exists.

---

## Session Expiration

Sessions MUST NOT remain valid indefinitely unless explicitly justified by the security model.

Expiration policies SHOULD consider:

* account sensitivity;
* device trust;
* operation sensitivity;
* environmental risk;
* user experience;
* threat model.

Expired sessions MUST NOT authorize new protected operations.

---

## Session Revocation

FamilyOS MUST support session revocation.

Revocation MAY be triggered by:

* logout;
* credential change;
* account suspension;
* suspected compromise;
* administrative action;
* security policy;
* identity revocation.

Security-sensitive revocation SHOULD invalidate related authentication artifacts when appropriate.

---

## Authentication Tokens

Authentication tokens MUST be treated as credentials.

Tokens SHOULD be:

* scoped;
* time-limited;
* protected in storage;
* protected in transit;
* revocable where appropriate;
* resistant to prediction.

Tokens MUST NOT provide broader access than necessary.

---

## Authorization

Authorization determines whether a principal may perform a requested operation against a resource.

Authorization answers:

> Is this principal permitted to perform this action on this resource under the current conditions?

Authorization MUST be explicit for security-sensitive operations.

---

## Authorization Request Model

A FamilyOS authorization decision SHOULD consider:

```text
Principal
    +
Action
    +
Resource
    +
Context
    │
    ▼
Authorization Decision
```

The context MAY include:

* family membership;
* resource ownership;
* principal role;
* granted capabilities;
* authentication assurance;
* environment;
* policy state;
* time constraints;
* delegation state.

---

## Default Deny

FamilyOS authorization MUST follow a default-deny principle.

If the system cannot establish that access is permitted, access SHOULD be denied.

```text
Authorization Result Unknown
            │
            ▼
           DENY
```

Missing policy information MUST NOT automatically produce permission.

---

## Permissions

A permission represents authorization to perform a defined operation.

Examples MAY include:

```text
document.read
document.create
document.update
document.delete

finance.account.read
finance.transaction.create

communication.message.send

security.identity.manage
```

Permission names SHOULD be explicit and stable.

Broad permissions SHOULD be avoided when narrower permissions can express the intended authority.

---

## Permission Model

Permissions SHOULD describe:

```text
Domain.Resource.Action
```

or another consistently governed FamilyOS naming convention.

Permissions MUST NOT rely solely on ambiguous human-readable labels.

The permission model SHOULD remain machine-verifiable.

---

## Roles

Roles group permissions according to organizational or domain responsibilities.

Example:

```text
Role
 │
 ├── Permission A
 ├── Permission B
 └── Permission C
```

Roles MAY simplify access administration.

Roles MUST NOT become an uncontrolled mechanism for accumulating privileges.

---

## Role-Based Access Control

FamilyOS MAY use Role-Based Access Control where role semantics are appropriate.

Example:

```text
Principal
    │
    ▼
Role Assignment
    │
    ▼
Role
    │
    ▼
Permissions
    │
    ▼
Protected Resources
```

Role assignment MUST itself be authorized.

Sensitive roles SHOULD receive additional governance.

---

## Capability-Based Authorization

FamilyOS capabilities provide a natural mechanism for expressing functional authority.

A capability represents permission to access a defined platform behavior.

Example:

```text
Principal
    │
    ▼
Granted Capability
    │
    ▼
Capability Request
    │
    ▼
Authorization
    │
    ▼
Capability Execution
```

Capability possession MUST NOT bypass resource-level authorization when additional authorization is required.

---

## Resource-Based Authorization

Authorization MAY depend on the specific resource being accessed.

Examples include:

* document ownership;
* family membership;
* financial account access;
* communication channel membership;
* administrative ownership;
* delegated access.

Resource authorization MUST use trusted ownership and relationship information.

---

## Attribute-Based Authorization

FamilyOS MAY use security attributes when authorization requires contextual decisions.

Attributes MAY describe:

* principal;
* resource;
* environment;
* operation;
* family relationship;
* authentication assurance.

Example:

```text
Principal Attributes
        +
Resource Attributes
        +
Environmental Context
        │
        ▼
Policy Evaluation
        │
        ▼
Allow / Deny
```

Attributes used for authorization MUST come from trusted sources.

---

## Policy-Based Authorization

Complex authorization decisions SHOULD be expressible through explicit policies.

Policies MAY define:

* permitted principals;
* permitted actions;
* protected resources;
* required conditions;
* explicit restrictions;
* exception handling.

Policy decisions SHOULD be deterministic and auditable.

---

## Authorization Enforcement

Authorization MUST be enforced at appropriate Policy Enforcement Points.

Possible enforcement points include:

* CLI commands;
* API boundaries;
* application services;
* capability dispatch;
* plugin runtime;
* repositories;
* integration adapters.

User-interface visibility MUST NOT be considered sufficient authorization enforcement.

---

## Authorization Decision Point

FamilyOS SHOULD centralize common authorization decision semantics without creating an unrestricted security dependency.

A conceptual model is:

```text
Protected Operation
        │
        ▼
Policy Enforcement Point
        │
        ▼
Authorization Request
        │
        ▼
Policy Decision Point
        │
        ▼
Policy / Permission Evaluation
        │
        ├────────► DENY
        │
        └────────► ALLOW
```

The enforcement point remains responsible for honoring the decision.

---

## Least Privilege

Every principal MUST receive only the privileges necessary for its intended responsibilities.

Least privilege applies to:

* family members;
* administrators;
* services;
* plugins;
* devices;
* automation;
* external integrations.

Privileges SHOULD be narrow in:

* capability;
* resource scope;
* duration;
* environment.

---

## Privilege Elevation

Temporary privilege elevation MAY be used when an operation requires exceptional authority.

Elevation MUST be:

* explicit;
* authorized;
* time-bounded where practical;
* auditable;
* revocable.

Privilege elevation MUST NOT silently become permanent access.

---

## Administrative Access

Administrative identities represent high-value security principals.

Administrative operations SHOULD receive stronger controls.

Controls MAY include:

* stronger authentication;
* re-authentication;
* dedicated administrative permissions;
* enhanced audit logging;
* restricted sessions;
* approval workflows.

Ordinary user identities SHOULD NOT receive administrative privileges by default.

---

## Family-Level Authorization

FamilyOS operates around family contexts and therefore requires explicit family boundaries.

A principal associated with one family MUST NOT automatically receive access to another family's resources.

Conceptually:

```text
Principal
    │
    ▼
Family Membership
    │
    ▼
Family Boundary
    │
    ▼
Resource Authorization
```

Cross-family access MUST require explicit authorization.

---

## Resource Ownership

Resources MAY have explicit ownership.

Ownership MAY influence authorization but MUST NOT necessarily imply unrestricted authority.

For example, ownership of a resource MAY permit modification while security or governance policies continue to restrict:

* deletion;
* sharing;
* export;
* administrative changes.

Ownership semantics MUST be defined by the relevant domain.

---

## Delegated Access

FamilyOS MAY support delegated authority.

Delegation MUST specify:

* delegating principal;
* receiving principal;
* granted authority;
* resource scope;
* validity period;
* revocation conditions.

Delegated authority MUST NOT exceed the delegating principal's ability to delegate.

---

## Service Identities

Services MUST use explicit service identities when participating in protected operations.

Service identities SHOULD have:

* stable identifiers;
* scoped credentials;
* explicit permissions;
* controlled lifecycle;
* auditable activity.

Services MUST NOT use human credentials as their normal authentication mechanism.

---

## Plugin Identities

Plugins MAY act as security principals when they access protected FamilyOS capabilities.

A plugin identity SHOULD identify:

* plugin identifier;
* plugin version where relevant;
* trust classification;
* granted capabilities;
* permission scope;
* execution context.

Plugin authorization MUST follow the Plugin Compliance Framework and FamilyOS security policies.

---

## Plugin Authorization

Plugin installation MUST NOT imply unrestricted platform access.

Plugin access SHOULD follow:

```text
Plugin
  │
  ▼
Plugin Identity
  │
  ▼
Declared Capabilities
  │
  ▼
Compliance Validation
  │
  ▼
Granted Permissions
  │
  ▼
Runtime Authorization
  │
  ▼
Controlled Platform Access
```

Unauthorized plugin capability requests MUST be denied.

---

## Device Identity

Devices MAY require explicit identity when they participate in trusted FamilyOS operations.

Device identity MAY support:

* trusted-device registration;
* session association;
* cryptographic authentication;
* device revocation;
* risk evaluation.

Device trust MUST NOT permanently replace user authentication for operations requiring verified user intent.

---

## Integration Identity

External integrations MUST have explicit identities and credentials.

Integration access SHOULD be:

* scoped;
* revocable;
* auditable;
* isolated from human credentials;
* restricted to required capabilities.

External integrations MUST NOT receive unrestricted FamilyOS access by default.

---

## Machine-to-Machine Authentication

Service-to-service and machine-to-machine interactions MUST use mechanisms appropriate for non-human identities.

Possible mechanisms include:

* cryptographic credentials;
* signed assertions;
* short-lived access tokens;
* mutually authenticated secure channels.

Long-lived unrestricted shared credentials SHOULD be avoided.

---

## External Identity Providers

FamilyOS MAY integrate with trusted external identity providers.

External authentication MUST NOT eliminate FamilyOS authorization.

```text
External Identity Provider
          │
          ▼
Authenticated External Identity
          │
          ▼
FamilyOS Identity Mapping
          │
          ▼
FamilyOS Authorization
```

External identity claims MUST be validated before use.

---

## Identity Mapping

External identities MUST map deterministically to FamilyOS principals.

Identity mapping MUST avoid relying exclusively on mutable or non-unique attributes.

Changes to external identity information MUST NOT accidentally transfer privileges between principals.

---

## Access Revocation

All significant forms of access MUST have a revocation strategy.

Revocable access includes:

* identities;
* sessions;
* credentials;
* tokens;
* roles;
* permissions;
* capabilities;
* delegated authority;
* plugin access;
* integration access.

Revocation mechanisms MUST be tested.

---

## Permission Changes

Permission changes SHOULD take effect predictably.

Changes MUST be auditable when security impact is significant.

Security-sensitive permission changes SHOULD record:

```text
Timestamp
Affected Principal
Previous Authority
New Authority
Change Actor
Reason
Correlation Identifier
```

Permission modifications MUST themselves require authorization.

---

## Privilege Escalation Prevention

FamilyOS MUST prevent principals from granting themselves authority they do not already possess or control.

Privilege-management operations MUST validate:

* acting principal;
* target principal;
* requested privilege;
* delegation authority;
* policy constraints.

Privilege escalation attempts SHOULD generate security events.

---

## Separation of Duties

Sensitive operations MAY require separation of duties.

No single principal SHOULD automatically control every stage of a high-risk operation when independent approval materially reduces risk.

Examples MAY include:

* security policy modification;
* critical credential rotation;
* production release approval;
* highly privileged access grants.

The requirement SHOULD reflect actual risk rather than unnecessary process complexity.

---

## Authentication and Authorization Logging

Security-relevant identity and access events SHOULD be observable.

Events MAY include:

* authentication success;
* authentication failure;
* logout;
* session revocation;
* authorization denial;
* privilege assignment;
* privilege revocation;
* identity suspension;
* identity activation;
* credential rotation.

Sensitive credential material MUST NOT be included in logs.

---

## Access Audit Model

Access audit records SHOULD allow reconstruction of significant security decisions.

A typical audit record may include:

```text
Timestamp
Principal
Authentication Context
Action
Resource
Authorization Decision
Policy Context
Result
Correlation Identifier
```

Audit records SHOULD be protected against unauthorized modification.

---

## Privacy and Identity Data

Identity information is sensitive and MAY contain personal data.

FamilyOS MUST minimize unnecessary identity data collection.

Identity attributes SHOULD be retained only when required for:

* functionality;
* security;
* compliance;
* audit;
* legitimate platform operation.

Security logging MUST avoid unnecessary duplication of personal information.

---

## Authentication Recovery

Authentication recovery mechanisms represent high-risk security paths.

Recovery MUST NOT provide weaker access controls than normal authentication without appropriate safeguards.

Recovery SHOULD verify sufficient evidence before allowing:

* credential reset;
* authentication-factor replacement;
* account recovery;
* administrative restoration.

Recovery events SHOULD be auditable.

---

## Compromised Identity Response

When an identity is suspected of compromise, FamilyOS SHOULD support:

```text
Detect
  │
  ▼
Restrict / Suspend
  │
  ▼
Revoke Sessions
  │
  ▼
Revoke Credentials
  │
  ▼
Investigate
  │
  ▼
Restore Trusted Authentication
  │
  ▼
Review Privileges
  │
  ▼
Reactivate
```

Restoring access MUST include verification that the identity can again be trusted.

---

## Fail-Safe Access Control

Identity and access controls MUST fail safely.

If authentication or authorization state cannot be validated reliably:

```text
Unknown State
     │
     ▼
Deny Protected Operation
     │
     ▼
Generate Security Evidence
```

System errors MUST NOT silently convert authorization failures into successful access.

---

## Identity and Clean Architecture

Identity and access mechanisms MUST respect FamilyOS Clean Architecture boundaries.

Domain logic SHOULD depend on security abstractions rather than infrastructure-specific authentication technologies.

Example:

```text
Interface
    │
    ▼
Application
    │
    ├── Authorization Port
    ▼
Domain
    ▲
    │
Infrastructure
    └── Authentication / Identity Provider
```

Authentication infrastructure MUST NOT unnecessarily leak into domain models.

---

## Identity and Domain-Driven Design

Security concepts SHOULD align with bounded contexts.

A domain SHOULD define its own resource-level authorization semantics where appropriate.

For example:

```text
Documents
    └── Document access rules

Finance
    └── Account and transaction permissions

Communication
    └── Message and channel permissions

Security
    └── Identity and privilege administration
```

A centralized authorization mechanism MUST NOT erase domain-specific security invariants.

---

## Identity and Security Architecture

This document implements the identity and access-control responsibilities established by `03-Security-Architecture.md`.

The relationship is:

```text
Security Architecture
        │
        ▼
Identity
        │
        ▼
Authentication
        │
        ▼
Authorization
        │
        ▼
Policy Enforcement
        │
        ▼
Protected Capability
```

Identity and access control are therefore foundational services of the FamilyOS Security Architecture.

---

## Identity and Plugin Compliance

Plugin identity and authorization MUST integrate with EPIC-PLUGIN-002 — Plugin Compliance Framework.

Compliance validation SHOULD verify:

* declared capabilities;
* requested permissions;
* prohibited privileges;
* plugin identity metadata;
* security policies;
* authorization integration.

A plugin MUST NOT be considered compliant when its required privileges cannot be explained or constrained.

---

## Identity and Testing

Identity, authentication, and authorization controls MUST be testable.

Testing SHOULD include:

* valid authentication;
* invalid authentication;
* expired credentials;
* revoked credentials;
* session expiration;
* session revocation;
* allowed authorization;
* denied authorization;
* cross-family access denial;
* privilege escalation attempts;
* plugin permission denial;
* delegated-access boundaries;
* recovery flows.

Negative authorization tests are mandatory for security-sensitive access paths.

---

## Identity and Quality

Identity and access controls MUST participate in FamilyOS quality governance.

Relevant quality evidence MAY include:

* authentication test results;
* authorization test results;
* access-control coverage;
* security findings;
* privilege reviews;
* policy-validation results.

Critical access-control failures MUST block release when they materially compromise FamilyOS security guarantees.

---

## Identity and Observability

Identity and access events MUST integrate with the FamilyOS Observability Framework.

Security telemetry SHOULD enable correlation between:

```text
Identity
   │
   ▼
Authentication
   │
   ▼
Authorization
   │
   ▼
Capability Execution
   │
   ▼
Result
```

Observability MUST preserve security and privacy requirements.

---

## Identity Governance

Identity and access architecture MUST be governed as a security-critical platform capability.

Material changes SHOULD require appropriate review.

Examples include:

* new authentication mechanisms;
* authorization model changes;
* new privileged roles;
* new plugin permissions;
* identity-provider integrations;
* changes to session security;
* changes to credential storage.

Significant decisions SHOULD be documented through FamilyOS architectural governance.

---

## Access Reviews

Privileged access SHOULD be reviewed periodically.

Reviews SHOULD verify:

* whether identities remain valid;
* whether roles remain necessary;
* whether permissions remain appropriately scoped;
* whether delegated access remains justified;
* whether inactive credentials should be revoked.

Unused or obsolete privileges SHOULD be removed.

---

## Identity Security Invariants

The following invariants apply across FamilyOS:

1. every security-relevant actor MUST have an identifiable principal where identity is required;
2. authentication and authorization MUST remain distinct;
3. authentication MUST NOT imply authorization;
4. sensitive operations MUST require explicit authorization;
5. unknown authorization states MUST default to denial;
6. least privilege MUST be the default access model;
7. credentials MUST be protected;
8. privileges MUST be revocable;
9. permission changes MUST themselves be authorized;
10. plugins MUST NOT receive unrestricted privileges by installation alone;
11. cross-family access MUST require explicit authorization;
12. security-sensitive identity and access events SHOULD be auditable;
13. recovery mechanisms MUST preserve authentication security;
14. access-control failures MUST fail safely.

---

## Reference Access Flow

The canonical FamilyOS access flow is:

```text
                    Actor
                      │
                      ▼
                Identity Claim
                      │
                      ▼
                Authentication
                      │
                      ▼
             Authenticated Principal
                      │
                      ▼
               Security Context
                      │
                      ▼
              Authorization Request
                      │

This flow provides the baseline authorization architecture for FamilyOS protected operations.

## Expected Outcomes

The FamilyOS Identity, Authentication and Authorization architecture enables:

* explicit security principals;
* reliable authentication;
* controlled credential handling;
* secure session management;
* explicit authorization;
* least-privilege access;
* capability-based security;
* family-boundary enforcement;
* controlled plugin permissions;
* service and device identities;
* revocable access;
* auditable privilege management;
* secure authentication recovery;
* consistent access-control enforcement.

---

## Final Principle

FamilyOS identity and access control is based on the following principle:

> Every protected operation must be attributable to an appropriate security principal, authenticated to the assurance required by the operation, and explicitly authorized for the requested action and resource.

Identity establishes who or what is acting.

Authentication establishes whether that identity can be trusted.

Authorization establishes what that identity is allowed to do.

These three responsibilities form the access-control foundation upon which the remaining FamilyOS security mechanisms are built.
