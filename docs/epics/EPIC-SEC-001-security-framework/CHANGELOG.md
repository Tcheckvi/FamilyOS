## 5.0.0 — Security Framework

### Historical Status

```text
PUBLISHED
```

Historical release tag:

```text
v5.0.0-security-framework
```

Historical publication commit:

```text
498fa16e692bf1461df2e4afba8bc4e485837a45

## Historical Documentation Model

The original Security Framework release used the compact FamilyOS framework documentation model.

Historical structure:

```text
Canonical Range:       00 → 09
Numbered Documents:    10
Control Documents:      0
Historical Files:      10
```

The seven standardized control documents used by later FamilyOS framework normalization were not part of the original publication.

This historical fact SHALL remain preserved.

---

## Added in 5.0.0

### Security Framework Foundation

Established **EPIC-SEC-001 — Security Framework** as the canonical FamilyOS security engineering foundation.

The framework introduced a dedicated security model covering:

* security principles;
* security architecture;
* identity;
* authentication;
* authorization;
* data protection;
* secrets;
* cryptography;
* threat modeling;
* risk;
* trust;
* security controls;
* compliance;
* implementation;
* automation;
* validation;
* release security.

---

## Canonical Historical Documents

The historical release established the following numbered-document structure:

```text
00-EPIC.md
01-Context-and-Vision.md
02-Security-Principles.md
03-Security-Architecture.md
04-Identity-Authentication-and-Authorization.md
05-Data-Secrets-and-Cryptography.md
06-Threat-Risk-and-Trust-Model.md
07-Security-Controls-and-Compliance.md
08-Implementation-and-Automation.md
09-Validation-and-Release.md
```

Historical numbered-document count:

```text
10
```

---

## Security Principles

Version `5.0.0` established the foundational FamilyOS Security Principles.

These include:

```text
Deny by Default
Least Privilege
Explicit Trust
Threat-Driven Security
Data Protection
Secret Safety
Cryptographic Soundness
Plugin-Aware Security
Security Observability
Testability
Automation
Vendor Neutrality
Proportionality
```

---

## Deny by Default

The framework established deny-by-default behavior as a canonical security expectation.

Absence of an explicit allow decision SHOULD normally result in denial rather than implicit permission.

---

## Least Privilege

The framework established least privilege as a permanent engineering requirement.

Subjects, services, plugins, and automation should receive only those capabilities required for legitimate operation.

---

## Explicit Trust

Version `5.0.0` established explicit trust as a foundational security concept.

Trust decisions SHOULD rely on evidence such as:

* identity;
* authentication;
* authorization;
* provenance;
* validated configuration;
* governed permissions;
* trusted artifacts.

---

## Threat-Driven Security

The framework established threat modeling as a security-design mechanism.

Security controls SHOULD correspond to real threats, attack paths, misuse cases, or material risk.

---

## Security Architecture

The release introduced the canonical Security Architecture.

Conceptually:

```text
Identity
   ↓
Authentication
   ↓
Authorization
   ↓
Policy
   ↓
Enforcement
   ↓
Capability / Data Access
   ↓
Security Evidence
```

The architecture established explicit separation between security responsibilities.

---

## Identity

The framework established identity as a first-class security concept.

Identity may represent:

* people;
* family members;
* services;
* plugins;
* automation;
* devices;
* integrations;
* operational actors.

Identity SHALL remain distinguishable from authorization.

---

## Authentication

Version `5.0.0` defined authentication as the process of establishing confidence in an asserted identity.

Authentication alone does not automatically imply permission to perform arbitrary operations.

---

## Authorization

The framework established explicit authorization semantics.

Conceptually:

```text
Subject
   +
Action
   +
Resource
   +
Context
   ↓
Authorization Decision
```

Authorization decisions SHOULD remain explicit, traceable, and governed.

---

## Permissions

Version `5.0.0` established stable permission semantics as an important security requirement.

Permissions SHOULD express explicit capabilities rather than rely on implicit implementation assumptions.

---

## Data Protection

The framework introduced canonical expectations for protecting FamilyOS data.

Areas include:

* confidentiality;
* integrity;
* availability;
* access control;
* classification;
* minimization;
* retention;
* encryption;
* auditability.

---

## Secret Management

Secrets were established as security-sensitive objects distinct from ordinary configuration.

Examples include:

* passwords;
* tokens;
* API credentials;
* encryption keys;
* signing keys;
* release credentials.

Secrets SHOULD remain protected throughout storage, use, logging, and release workflows.

---

## Cryptography

Version `5.0.0` established expectations for sound cryptographic engineering.

The framework favors:

* accepted algorithms;
* trusted implementations;
* appropriate key management;
* secure randomness;
* integrity protection;
* explicit cryptographic purpose.

Custom cryptographic primitives are strongly discouraged.

---

## Threat Model

The framework introduced a canonical threat-oriented model.

Conceptually:

```text
Asset
  ↓
Threat
  ↓
Attack Path
  ↓
Impact
  ↓
Likelihood
  ↓
Risk
  ↓
Mitigation
  ↓
Residual Risk
```

---

## Risk Management

Security risk was established as a governed engineering concern.

Risk may influence:

* architecture;
* implementation;
* control selection;
* testing;
* validation;
* release decisions;
* exceptions;
* runtime monitoring.

---

## Trust Model

Version `5.0.0` established trust boundaries and trust assumptions as explicit security concepts.

Examples include:

```text
User → Application
Plugin → Platform
External Integration → FamilyOS
Build Environment → Release Environment
Artifact → Runtime
Service → Protected Data
```

Crossing a trust boundary SHOULD trigger appropriate security evaluation.

---

## Security Controls

The framework introduced a structured control model.

Controls may be:

```text
Preventive
Detective
Corrective
Compensating
```

A control SHOULD identify:

* purpose;
* applicability;
* owner;
* implementation;
* evidence;
* validation mechanism.

---

## Security Compliance

Version `5.0.0` established security compliance as an evidence-based evaluation of applicable security requirements and controls.

Compliance may consume:

* testing evidence;
* policy evidence;
* dependency findings;
* configuration validation;
* security reviews;
* release evidence;
* runtime evidence.

---

## Implementation Direction

The framework established implementation guidance while remaining technology-neutral.

Potential implementation areas include:

* authentication services;
* authorization services;
* policy evaluation;
* secret-provider abstractions;
* cryptographic utilities;
* security validation;
* plugin security;
* audit evidence.

---

## Security Automation

Version `5.0.0` established automation as an important security capability.

Automation may include:

* security scanning;
* secret scanning;
* dependency analysis;
* policy validation;
* configuration validation;
* permission validation;
* artifact validation;
* security release gates.

Automation SHALL NOT convert unresolved findings into successful validation without governance.

---

## Plugin Security

The framework recognized plugins as important trust boundaries.

Plugin security concerns include:

* plugin identity;
* capabilities;
* permissions;
* provenance;
* dependencies;
* data access;
* execution boundaries;
* compliance.

Official plugin status SHALL NOT imply unrestricted trust.

---

## Security Validation

Version `5.0.0` established evidence-based security validation.

Security validation may consume:

* security tests;
* authorization tests;
* negative tests;
* secret-scanning evidence;
* dependency findings;
* policy findings;
* configuration checks;
* artifact integrity;
* provenance;
* risk assessments.

---

## Release Security

The framework integrated security into the FamilyOS release lifecycle.

Conceptually:

```text
Release Candidate
        ↓
Security Validation
        ↓
Security Evidence
        ↓
Security Gate
        ↓
Release Decision
```

EPIC-REL-001 remains authoritative for the general release lifecycle.

---

## Security Gates

Security gates may evaluate:

* critical vulnerabilities;
* authorization defects;
* authentication defects;
* secret exposure;
* insecure cryptography;
* dependency risks;
* plugin-security failures;
* missing security evidence;
* artifact-integrity failures;
* release-pipeline trust.

Blocking security findings SHOULD normally prevent ordinary release progression unless an explicit governed exception applies.

---

## Security Exceptions

The framework established explicit governance requirements for security exceptions.

An exception SHOULD identify:

* affected requirement;
* justification;
* risk;
* scope;
* owner;
* approval;
* review or expiration expectations.

Exceptions SHALL NOT alter historical evidence to make a failed security requirement appear successful.

---

## Testing Integration

EPIC-SEC-001 integrates with the FamilyOS Testing Framework.

Security-specific requirements may be implemented using testing capabilities such as:

* authorization testing;
* authentication testing;
* denied-path testing;
* malformed-input testing;
* plugin-security testing;
* configuration testing;
* dependency validation.

---

## Quality Integration

The framework integrates security evidence with the FamilyOS Quality Framework.

Security findings may contribute to:

* quality evidence;
* quality gates;
* risk assessment;
* release readiness;
* compliance decisions.

---

## Build Integration

Security integrates with the FamilyOS Build Framework through:

* dependency trust;
* build-environment trust;
* credential handling;
* supply-chain protection;
* artifact integrity;
* provenance.

A successful build does not automatically establish security readiness.

---

## Release Integration

EPIC-SEC-001 integrates with the Release Framework through security evidence and release gates.

Security does not replace the release lifecycle.

---

## Observability Integration

The framework integrates with the Observability Framework.

Security may consume observability for:

* authentication failures;
* authorization failures;
* anomalous behavior;
* runtime policy failures;
* investigation;
* audit evidence;
* compliance evidence.

---

## Plugin Compliance Integration

Security requirements may become inputs to plugin-compliance decisions.

Plugin Compliance remains governed separately by its canonical FamilyOS framework.

---

## Historical Release Completion

Version `5.0.0` was historically completed and published under:

```text
v5.0.0-security-framework
```

The tag dereferences to:

```text
498fa16e692bf1461df2e4afba8bc4e485837a45
```

The release is therefore historically published.

---

## Historical Tag Integrity

The historical release tag SHALL remain immutable.

The following operations are prohibited during current normalization:

```text
Move historical tag
Delete and recreate historical tag
Force-update historical tag
Point historical tag at normalization commit
Rewrite historical publication commit
```

Current corrections belong to later forward repository history.

---

## Post-Release Normalization

After historical publication, the FamilyOS framework-governance model evolved.

EPIC-SEC-001 is therefore receiving a standardized control-document layer.

Added control documents:

```text
EPIC-SEC-001.md
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

This changes the current repository representation to:

```text
10 numbered documents
+
7 control documents
=
17 canonical files
```

---

## Historical vs Current Repository State

Historical release:

```text
Canonical Range:       00 → 09
Numbered Documents:    10
Control Documents:      0
Historical Files:      10
```

Current normalized repository:

```text
Canonical Range:       00 → 09
Numbered Documents:    10
Control Documents:      7
Canonical Files:       17
```

The second structure SHALL NOT be retroactively attributed to the historical release.

---

## Current Revalidation

The normalized repository representation requires current evidence-based revalidation.

Required checks include:

```text
YAML Parse
YAML Contract
Filesystem Contract
Canonical Inventory
Numbering Integrity
Control Documents
Empty File Check
Manifest Synchronization
README Synchronization
EPIC Summary Synchronization
Changelog Synchronization
Revision History Synchronization
State Consistency
Reference Integrity
Placeholder Validation
Security Semantic Consistency
Historical Tag Integrity
Ruff
MyPy
Pytest
Diff Check
Final Repository State
```

---

## Validation Evidence Policy

The required model is:

```text
Execute
    ↓
Observe
    ↓
Evaluate
    ↓
Record
```

The prohibited model is:

```text
Requirement Documented
    ↓
Assume Success
    ↓
Record PASS
```

No current validation check SHALL be declared successful without actual evidence.

---

## Current Normalization State

```text
Framework Version:       5.0.0
Framework Status:        Historically Published

Historical Publication:  Published
Historical Tag:          v5.0.0-security-framework

Current Activity:         Post-Release Revalidation
Repository Validation:   Validated
Final Revalidation:      Validated
```

---

## Future Changes

Future Security Framework revisions may introduce:

* machine-readable security policies;
* executable authorization policy;
* stronger security evidence schemas;
* artifact signing;
* provenance attestations;
* formal threat-model schemas;
* automated risk scoring;
* security-control catalogs;
* compliance profiles;
* automated security gates;
* advanced secret-management integration;
* security observability integration;
* security incident-response integration.

Such changes SHALL follow normal framework versioning and release governance rather than modifying historical version `5.0.0` in place.

---

## Final Changelog Principle

The canonical historical statement for EPIC-SEC-001 is:

```text
Version:                 5.0.0
Historical Publication:  Published
Historical Tag:          v5.0.0-security-framework
Historical Commit:       498fa16e692bf1461df2e4afba8bc4e485837a45
Historical Tag Policy:   Immutable
```

The current control-document normalization is a post-release repository-governance change.

It preserves the framework's original release identity while bringing EPIC-SEC-001 into alignment with the current FamilyOS framework-control model.
