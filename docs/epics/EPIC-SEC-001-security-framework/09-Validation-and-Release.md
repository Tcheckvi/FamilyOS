# Security Framework

## 09 Validation and Release

### Overview

Security validation and release governance establish the final assurance mechanisms required before FamilyOS software, plugins, artifacts, configurations, or platform changes are considered eligible for release.

Security must not be evaluated only during implementation.

Every release represents a new security state of the FamilyOS ecosystem and therefore requires sufficient evidence that applicable security requirements remain satisfied.

Security validation determines whether security controls, architecture requirements, implementation constraints, tests, dependencies, configurations, artifacts, and operational assumptions meet the required security baseline.

Security release governance determines whether the resulting evidence is sufficient to authorize distribution or deployment.

The fundamental rule is:

> A FamilyOS release MUST NOT be considered security-ready solely because it builds successfully or passes functional tests.

Security readiness requires explicit validation.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to establish the FamilyOS requirements for:

* security validation;
* validation scope;
* validation planning;
* security test execution;
* control verification;
* compliance verification;
* vulnerability assessment;
* dependency validation;
* secret validation;
* cryptographic validation;
* plugin security validation;
* artifact integrity;
* provenance;
* security evidence;
* release security gates;
* release authorization;
* security exceptions;
* release blocking;
* post-release validation;
* emergency releases;
* rollback and recovery;
* release traceability.

The objective is to ensure that every FamilyOS release preserves the security guarantees established by EPIC-SEC-001.

---

## Security Validation Objectives

Security validation MUST provide sufficient confidence that:

1. applicable security requirements are implemented;
2. mandatory security controls remain effective;
3. authentication and authorization behave correctly;
4. sensitive data remains appropriately protected;
5. secrets are not unintentionally exposed;
6. cryptographic mechanisms satisfy approved requirements;
7. dependencies do not introduce unacceptable known risk;
8. plugins respect declared security boundaries;
9. artifacts have verifiable integrity;
10. release provenance can be established;
11. unresolved findings are appropriately governed;
12. security evidence supports the release decision.

Validation SHOULD be proportional to release risk.

---

## Validation Model

The FamilyOS security validation model is:

```text
Security Requirements
        │
        ▼
Applicable Controls
        │
        ▼
Implementation
        │
        ▼
Security Validation
        │
        ▼
Evidence Collection
        │
        ▼
Compliance Evaluation
        │
        ▼
Release Security Gate
        │
   ┌────┴────┐
   ▼         ▼
 PASS       BLOCK
   │
   ▼
Release Authorization
```

Every significant release SHOULD follow this model.

---

## Validation Principles

Security validation MUST follow several principles.

Validation SHOULD be:

* evidence-based;
* repeatable;
* risk-aware;
* traceable;
* independent where appropriate;
* automated where reliable;
* integrated into engineering workflows.

Validation MUST NOT depend exclusively on informal confidence or individual memory.

---

## Validation Scope

The validation scope MUST correspond to the actual release scope.

Security validation MAY cover:

* source code;
* configuration;
* dependencies;
* plugins;
* infrastructure definitions;
* build pipelines;
* release artifacts;
* documentation;
* policies;
* migration logic;
* deployment configuration.

The scope SHOULD identify security-sensitive changes explicitly.

---

## Change-Based Validation

Not every release requires identical security validation.

Validation SHOULD consider what changed.

```text
Release Change
      │
      ▼
Security Impact Analysis
      │
      ▼
Affected Controls
      │
      ▼
Required Validation
```

Changes affecting security-critical components SHOULD trigger stronger validation.

---

## Security-Critical Changes

Security-critical changes include modifications to:

* authentication;
* authorization;
* identity management;
* cryptography;
* secrets;
* permission models;
* plugin execution;
* security policies;
* sensitive-data storage;
* network exposure;
* release signing;
* security observability.

Such changes SHOULD receive explicit security review.

---

## Validation Planning

Security validation SHOULD be planned before release execution.

A validation plan SHOULD identify:

* release scope;
* applicable controls;
* required tests;
* required scans;
* required reviews;
* expected evidence;
* blocking criteria;
* exception handling.

For significant releases, validation requirements SHOULD be known before the final release stage.

---

## Validation Layers

Security validation SHOULD occur at multiple engineering layers.

```text
Developer Validation
        │
        ▼
Commit / Pull Request Validation
        │
        ▼
Continuous Integration
        │
        ▼
Build Validation
        │
        ▼
Release Validation
        │
        ▼
Deployment Validation
        │
        ▼
Runtime Validation
```

Earlier validation reduces the probability of discovering critical issues during final release preparation.

---

## Developer Security Validation

Developers SHOULD validate security-sensitive changes before integration.

Developer validation MAY include:

* unit tests;
* authorization tests;
* input-validation tests;
* static analysis;
* secret checks;
* dependency checks;
* configuration validation.

Local validation SHOULD provide rapid feedback.

---

## Pull Request Security Validation

Pull requests SHOULD trigger security validation appropriate to the changed components.

Validation MAY include:

* security test execution;
* static analysis;
* dependency analysis;
* secret scanning;
* policy checks;
* plugin compliance checks.

Security failures SHOULD be visible during review.

---

## Continuous Integration Validation

CI SHOULD automate repeatable security validation.

A typical security validation pipeline MAY include:

```text
Source
  │
  ▼
Formatting / Linting
  │
  ▼
Static Analysis
  │
  ▼
Type Validation
  │
  ▼
Security Tests
  │
  ▼
Secret Scanning
  │
  ▼
Dependency Analysis
  │
  ▼
Compliance Validation
  │
  ▼
Build
```

Required security validation MUST NOT be silently skipped.

---

## Security Test Validation

Security-related tests MUST pass before release unless an approved exception explicitly permits otherwise.

Tests SHOULD cover:

* authentication;
* authorization;
* access denial;
* privilege boundaries;
* secret handling;
* cryptographic behavior;
* data protection;
* plugin permissions;
* security failure handling;
* recovery paths.

Negative security tests are particularly important.

---

## Negative Security Validation

FamilyOS MUST verify that prohibited behavior fails correctly.

Examples include:

```text
Unauthorized Principal
        │
        ▼
Protected Operation
        │
        ▼
DENIED
```

Validation SHOULD confirm that:

* invalid credentials fail;
* revoked credentials fail;
* unauthorized permissions fail;
* cross-family access fails;
* invalid signatures fail;
* unauthorized plugin capabilities fail.

Successful-path testing alone is insufficient.

---

## Authentication Validation

Authentication validation SHOULD verify:

* valid credentials;
* invalid credentials;
* credential expiration;
* credential revocation;
* session creation;
* session expiration;
* session revocation;
* recovery flows.

Security-sensitive authentication changes SHOULD receive regression testing.

---

## Authorization Validation

Authorization validation MUST verify both allowed and denied operations.

Tests SHOULD cover:

* role boundaries;
* permission boundaries;
* capability restrictions;
* resource ownership;
* family boundaries;
* delegated access;
* administrative access;
* plugin access.

Unknown authorization states SHOULD result in denial.

---

## Data Protection Validation

Data-protection validation SHOULD verify:

* access restrictions;
* encryption requirements;
* sensitive logging restrictions;
* backup protection;
* export authorization;
* retention behavior;
* deletion behavior.

Validation SHOULD reflect the classification of the affected information.

---

## Secret Validation

Release validation MUST verify that production secrets have not been unintentionally included in release materials.

Validation SHOULD inspect:

* source code;
* configuration;
* documentation;
* generated artifacts;
* test fixtures;
* build logs where practical.

Detected real secrets MUST be treated as potentially compromised.

---

## Secret Scanning

Automated secret scanning SHOULD be integrated into engineering workflows.

Scanning SHOULD occur sufficiently early to prevent secret exposure from propagating through:

```text
Source
  │
  ▼
Repository
  │
  ▼
Build
  │
  ▼
Artifact
  │
  ▼
Release
```

A secret removed from the latest revision MAY still require rotation if it previously entered repository history.

---

## Cryptographic Validation

Cryptographic validation SHOULD verify:

* approved algorithms;
* approved libraries;
* appropriate key usage;
* secure randomness;
* key separation;
* key storage expectations;
* signature validation;
* cryptographic failure behavior.

Deprecated cryptography SHOULD fail applicable validation gates.

---

## Key and Credential Validation

Security validation SHOULD verify that release processes do not expose:

* signing keys;
* deployment credentials;
* service credentials;
* API tokens;
* encryption keys.

Production credentials MUST remain appropriately isolated.

---

## Dependency Validation

Dependencies MUST be evaluated before release according to their security risk.

Validation SHOULD consider:

* known vulnerabilities;
* version state;
* provenance;
* integrity;
* maintenance status;
* dependency policy.

Critical dependency vulnerabilities SHOULD block release unless explicitly governed.

---

## Transitive Dependencies

Security validation SHOULD consider transitive dependencies where tooling and risk justify it.

A direct dependency MAY introduce vulnerabilities through its dependency graph.

Dependency visibility SHOULD therefore extend beyond explicitly declared top-level packages where practical.

---

## Supply Chain Validation

FamilyOS release validation SHOULD protect the software supply chain.

Controls MAY include:

* dependency locking;
* package integrity verification;
* trusted repositories;
* build isolation;
* artifact checksums;
* provenance evidence;
* signing.

Supply chain trust MUST be evidence-based.

---

## Plugin Security Validation

Plugins MUST satisfy applicable security requirements before release.

Plugin validation SHOULD verify:

* plugin identity;
* metadata;
* declared capabilities;
* permissions;
* dependency state;
* data access;
* secret handling;
* security tests;
* compliance status.

Official plugin status MUST NOT bypass validation.

---

## Plugin Capability Validation

Declared plugin capabilities SHOULD match actual behavior.

A plugin MUST NOT silently depend on capabilities outside its approved declaration.

Validation SHOULD identify:

* undeclared capabilities;
* excessive permissions;
* prohibited access;
* invalid security metadata.

---

## Plugin Compliance Validation

Plugin security validation MUST integrate with EPIC-PLUGIN-002 — Plugin Compliance Framework.

The release process SHOULD consume plugin compliance evidence rather than duplicate unrelated compliance logic.

A non-compliant security-critical plugin SHOULD block release.

---

## Configuration Validation

Security configuration MUST be validated before production release.

Validation SHOULD cover:

* authentication configuration;
* authorization policy;
* cryptographic settings;
* secret sources;
* logging configuration;
* network exposure;
* plugin permissions.

Development defaults MUST NOT silently become production configuration.

---

## Infrastructure Validation

Where infrastructure is part of the release scope, validation SHOULD verify:

* access controls;
* environment separation;
* network restrictions;
* secret configuration;
* runtime permissions;
* logging;
* backup controls.

Infrastructure security MUST be considered part of release security.

---

## Build Validation

Security release validation depends on a trustworthy build.

The build SHOULD demonstrate:

* correct source revision;
* dependency integrity;
* successful required tests;
* reproducible configuration where applicable;
* artifact generation under controlled conditions.

The Security Framework integrates with EPIC-BLD-001 — Build Framework for these guarantees.

---

## Build Environment Security

The build environment SHOULD be protected against unauthorized modification.

Security-sensitive build systems SHOULD restrict:

* administrative access;
* secret access;
* release credentials;
* artifact publication.

Untrusted code MUST NOT automatically receive privileged release credentials.

---

## Artifact Validation

Release artifacts MUST correspond to the intended release source.

Artifact validation SHOULD verify:

* expected files;
* expected version;
* integrity;
* metadata;
* absence of prohibited content.

Release artifacts SHOULD NOT contain unnecessary development files, secrets, or sensitive temporary information.

---

## Artifact Integrity

Important artifacts SHOULD have cryptographic integrity information.

For example:

```text
Artifact
   │
   ▼
Cryptographic Hash
   │
   ▼
Release Metadata
```

Consumers or deployment processes SHOULD be able to verify integrity where required.

---

## Artifact Signing

High-trust release artifacts MAY be digitally signed.

Signing provides stronger evidence of:

* origin;
* integrity;
* release authority.

Signing keys MUST receive strong protection.

A signature MUST NOT be trusted solely because it is cryptographically valid; the signing identity must also be trusted.

---

## Provenance

FamilyOS SHOULD maintain sufficient provenance to determine how an artifact was produced.

Provenance MAY include:

* repository revision;
* Git commit;
* release tag;
* build environment;
* dependency state;
* build workflow;
* validation results.

Provenance strengthens supply chain assurance.

---

## Release Traceability

A FamilyOS release SHOULD be traceable across:

```text
Requirement
    │
    ▼
Source Revision
    │
    ▼
Validation
    │
    ▼
Build
    │
    ▼
Artifact
    │
    ▼
Release Tag
    │
    ▼
Release Record
```

Security-relevant evidence SHOULD be associated with the corresponding release.

---

## Security Evidence

Release security decisions MUST rely on sufficient evidence.

Evidence MAY include:

* security test results;
* static-analysis reports;
* secret scan results;
* dependency reports;
* compliance reports;
* plugin validation;
* artifact hashes;
* provenance records;
* security review outcomes.

Evidence SHOULD be reproducible where practical.

---

## Evidence Completeness

Security evidence SHOULD demonstrate that all mandatory validation categories applicable to the release have been evaluated.

Missing mandatory evidence SHOULD result in:

```text
Missing Required Evidence
          │
          ▼
    Validation Incomplete
          │
          ▼
      Release BLOCKED
```

Absence of evidence MUST NOT automatically be interpreted as successful validation.

---

## Evidence Integrity

Security evidence itself MUST be protected from unauthorized modification.

Important evidence MAY use:

* version-controlled records;
* checksums;
* signed reports;
* immutable CI results;
* controlled artifact storage.

Evidence integrity is necessary for trustworthy release decisions.

---

## Evidence Retention

Security release evidence SHOULD be retained according to FamilyOS governance requirements.

Retention SHOULD support:

* audits;
* incident investigations;
* regression analysis;
* release comparison;
* rollback decisions.

Evidence SHOULD be associated with a specific release whenever possible.

---

## Validation Status

A security validation MAY produce statuses such as:

```text
PASS
FAIL
PASS_WITH_EXCEPTION
INCOMPLETE
NOT_APPLICABLE
```

Status semantics MUST remain consistent.

---

## PASS

PASS indicates that:

* applicable mandatory checks succeeded;
* required evidence exists;
* no blocking findings remain;
* required controls are satisfied.

PASS allows progression to release authorization.

---

## FAIL

FAIL indicates that one or more blocking security conditions are unsatisfied.

A failed security validation MUST prevent ordinary release progression.

---

## PASS WITH EXCEPTION

PASS_WITH_EXCEPTION MAY be used when an approved security exception permits release despite a known deviation.

The exception MUST be explicit and traceable.

This status MUST NOT be used to bypass unreviewed failures.

---

## INCOMPLETE

INCOMPLETE indicates that required validation or evidence is missing.

An incomplete security assessment MUST NOT be interpreted as PASS.

---

## Release Security Gate

The release security gate evaluates whether the release satisfies mandatory security conditions.

```text
Security Tests
      +
Control Compliance
      +
Dependency State
      +
Secret Validation
      +
Plugin Compliance
      +
Artifact Integrity
      +
Open Findings
      +
Exceptions
      │
      ▼
Security Release Gate
```

The result MUST be explicit.

---

## Baseline Release Gate

A standard FamilyOS security release gate SHOULD require:

* no unresolved critical security findings;
* no unapproved high-severity findings;
* required security tests passing;
* required compliance controls passing;
* no known exposed production secrets;
* acceptable dependency state;
* approved cryptographic baseline;
* required plugin compliance;
* artifact integrity evidence;
* required documentation complete.

Specific releases MAY impose additional requirements.

---

## Release Blocking Criteria

A release SHOULD be blocked when conditions include:

* authentication bypass;
* authorization bypass;
* unresolved critical vulnerability;
* exposed production credential;
* compromised signing key;
* unauthorized plugin capability;
* failed mandatory security control;
* unverified artifact integrity;
* missing mandatory security evidence.

Blocking criteria SHOULD remain explicit and objective.

---

## Critical Findings

Unresolved critical findings MUST normally block release.

Examples include:

* arbitrary privilege escalation;
* unrestricted sensitive-data access;
* production key exposure;
* release-pipeline compromise;
* authentication bypass.

Exceptions for critical findings SHOULD be extremely rare and require explicit governance.

---

## High-Severity Findings

High-severity findings SHOULD normally block release.

A release MAY proceed only when:

* risk is understood;
* compensating controls exist;
* explicit approval exists;
* remediation is tracked.

Convenience alone is not sufficient justification.

---

## Medium and Low Findings

Medium and low findings MAY be permitted depending on risk.

They SHOULD have:

* ownership;
* remediation status;
* target resolution;
* risk evaluation.

Accumulation of lower-severity findings SHOULD be considered during release assessment.

---

## Security Exceptions

Release security exceptions MUST follow the exception-management requirements defined by the Security Framework.

An exception MUST identify:

* affected requirement;
* affected control;
* release scope;
* risk;
* justification;
* compensating controls;
* owner;
* approval;
* expiration or review condition.

---

## Release Authorization

Passing automated gates does not necessarily constitute final release authorization.

Release authorization SHOULD verify that:

* validation is complete;
* evidence is trustworthy;
* findings are understood;
* exceptions are approved;
* artifact identity is known;
* release scope matches validation scope.

The authorized release MUST correspond to the validated artifact.

---

## Release Decision

The final security release decision SHOULD be one of:

```text
AUTHORIZED
BLOCKED
AUTHORIZED_WITH_EXCEPTION
```

The decision SHOULD be recorded for significant releases.

---

## Separation of Duties

High-risk releases MAY require separation between:

* implementation;
* security validation;
* release authorization.

A single engineer SHOULD NOT necessarily be required to control every security-sensitive stage.

The level of separation SHOULD reflect actual release risk.

---

## Release Identity

Every release SHOULD have a stable identity.

Release identity MAY include:

* semantic version;
* Git tag;
* commit identifier;
* artifact checksum;
* release timestamp.

The release identity MUST allow validation evidence to be connected to the exact released state.

---

## Git Tag Security

Git tags used as authoritative release references SHOULD be protected according to release importance.

Release tags SHOULD correspond to the validated commit.

Where stronger assurance is required, tags MAY be cryptographically signed.

Tags MUST NOT be moved silently after release.

---

## Version Integrity

The declared release version MUST match the version embedded in relevant artifacts and release metadata.

Version mismatches SHOULD fail release validation.

---

## Release Documentation

Security-relevant release documentation SHOULD include:

* release identity;
* security validation status;
* known findings;
* approved exceptions;
* relevant security changes;
* migration considerations where applicable.

Documentation MUST follow EPIC-DOC-001 — Documentation Framework.

---

## Release Manifest

A release manifest MAY provide a structured inventory of the release.

It MAY include:

```text
Release Version
Commit
Tag
Artifacts
Checksums
Dependencies
Plugins
Validation Status
Security Evidence
```

The manifest SHOULD be generated or verified from authoritative release information.

---

## Security Release Record

A significant FamilyOS release SHOULD have a security release record.

The record MAY contain:

```text
Release:
vX.Y.Z

Commit:
<commit>

Security Validation:
PASS

Critical Findings:
0

High Findings:
0

Exceptions:
0

Artifact Integrity:
VERIFIED

Plugin Compliance:
PASS

Release Decision:
AUTHORIZED
```

This record provides concise security assurance evidence.

---

## Release Automation

Security release validation SHOULD be automated where practical.

Automation SHOULD support:

* consistent checks;
* repeatable evidence;
* reduced human error;
* faster release decisions.

Automation MUST NOT allow mandatory checks to disappear silently.

---

## Release Pipeline Security

The release pipeline itself is security-sensitive.

It MUST protect:

* release credentials;
* signing material;
* publication permissions;
* artifact integrity;
* workflow definitions.

Unauthorized modification of the release pipeline MUST be treated as a significant security risk.

---

## Protected Release Credentials

Release credentials SHOULD be:

* scoped;
* protected;
* auditable;
* revocable;
* unavailable to untrusted workflows.

Long-lived unrestricted publication credentials SHOULD be avoided.

---

## Release Environment

Release operations SHOULD execute in a controlled environment.

The environment SHOULD minimize:

* unrelated software;
* uncontrolled dependencies;
* unauthorized access;
* unnecessary secrets;
* mutable external state.

Release environments SHOULD be reproducible where practical.

---

## Emergency Releases

FamilyOS MAY require emergency releases for urgent security remediation.

Emergency procedures MAY reduce non-essential process overhead but MUST NOT remove fundamental security validation.

At minimum, emergency releases SHOULD verify:

* intended security fix;
* build integrity;
* essential tests;
* artifact identity;
* release authorization.

Deferred validation MUST be completed afterward where applicable.

---

## Security Hotfixes

Security hotfixes SHOULD remain narrowly scoped.

A security hotfix SHOULD avoid unrelated feature changes when possible.

Narrow scope reduces:

* regression risk;
* validation complexity;
* release uncertainty.

---

## Rollback Readiness

Security release planning SHOULD consider rollback before deployment.

Rollback readiness SHOULD identify:

* previous trusted release;
* compatible data state;
* configuration requirements;
* credential implications;
* migration reversibility.

Rollback MUST NOT restore known compromised security material.

---

## Security Rollback

Rollback MAY be required when:

* a security regression is discovered;
* authorization fails incorrectly;
* cryptographic behavior is broken;
* sensitive data becomes exposed;
* deployment integrity cannot be established.

The rollback target MUST itself represent an acceptable trusted state.

---

## Credential and Key Considerations During Rollback

Rollback MUST NOT blindly restore revoked or compromised credentials.

Security recovery MAY require:

```text
Application Rollback
        +
Credential Rotation
        +
Key Review
        +
Session Revocation
        +
Security Validation
```

Software rollback alone may not fully restore security.

---

## Post-Release Validation

Security responsibilities continue after release.

Post-release validation MAY include:

* deployment verification;
* runtime health checks;
* authentication validation;
* authorization validation;
* security-log review;
* configuration verification;
* integrity verification.

Post-release checks SHOULD focus on risks that cannot be fully validated before deployment.

---

## Runtime Security Observation

Security observability SHOULD provide evidence that released controls remain operational.

Relevant events MAY include:

* authentication failures;
* authorization denials;
* privilege changes;
* policy violations;
* integrity failures;
* secret access;
* plugin violations.

Runtime observation MUST integrate with the FamilyOS Observability Framework.

---

## Configuration Drift

A secure release can become insecure because of post-release configuration changes.

FamilyOS SHOULD detect significant drift in:

* permissions;
* authentication configuration;
* network exposure;
* secret configuration;
* cryptographic settings;
* plugin permissions.

Material drift SHOULD trigger security review or remediation.

---

## Newly Discovered Vulnerabilities

A release that was secure at publication MAY later become affected by newly discovered vulnerabilities.

FamilyOS SHOULD support reassessment when:

* dependency vulnerabilities are disclosed;
* cryptographic weaknesses are discovered;
* platform vulnerabilities emerge;
* plugin vulnerabilities are reported.

Release security status is therefore not permanently static.

---

## Release Revocation

A release MAY need to be deprecated or revoked for security reasons.

Revocation MAY occur because of:

* critical vulnerability;
* compromised artifact;
* compromised signing identity;
* malicious dependency;
* severe data-protection failure.

Revocation SHOULD be communicated and traceable.

---

## Security Validation Failure Handling

When security validation fails:

```text
Validation Failure
       │
       ▼
Record Finding
       │
       ▼
Classify Severity
       │
       ▼
Determine Impact
       │
   ┌───┴────────┐
   ▼            ▼
Remediate    Exception Review
   │            │
   └─────┬──────┘
         ▼
    Revalidate
         │
         ▼
 Release Decision
```

Failed checks MUST NOT simply be rerun until ignored or hidden.

---

## Revalidation

Any remediation affecting a failed security control MUST be revalidated.

Revalidation SHOULD include:

* failed control;
* related controls;
* regression tests;
* affected artifacts.

A fix is not complete until appropriate validation confirms it.

---

## Validation Evidence Traceability

Security evidence SHOULD connect directly to:

```text
Release
   │
   ├── Commit
   ├── Build
   ├── Tests
   ├── Security Scans
   ├── Compliance Results
   ├── Artifact
   └── Release Decision
```

This relationship allows future reconstruction of release security state.

---

## Validation and Testing Framework

Security validation MUST integrate with EPIC-TST-001 — Testing Framework.

The Testing Framework provides standardized mechanisms for:

* test organization;
* test execution;
* regression testing;
* test evidence;
* automation.

EPIC-SEC-001 defines the security-specific expectations applied through those mechanisms.

---

## Validation and Quality Framework

Security validation MUST integrate with EPIC-QLT-001 — Quality Framework.

Security failures represent quality failures when they violate required platform guarantees.

Security quality gates SHOULD participate in overall release readiness.

---

## Validation and Build Framework

Security validation MUST integrate with EPIC-BLD-001 — Build Framework.

The build process provides the controlled transition from validated source to release artifact.

Security validation MUST ensure that the artifact being released corresponds to the validated build state.

---

## Validation and Release Framework

EPIC-REL-001 — Release Framework defines the broader FamilyOS release lifecycle.

EPIC-SEC-001 adds security-specific requirements to that lifecycle.

```text
Release Framework
       │
       ▼
Release Candidate
       │
       ▼
Security Validation
       │
       ▼
Security Gate
       │
       ▼
Release Authorization
       │
       ▼
FamilyOS Release
```

Security validation MUST NOT create an unrelated parallel release process.

---

## Validation and Documentation Framework

Security validation evidence and release documentation MUST follow EPIC-DOC-001 — Documentation Framework.

Documentation SHOULD remain:

* structured;
* traceable;
* versioned;
* reviewable.

Security release evidence SHOULD be understandable by future maintainers.

---

## Validation and Plugin Compliance

EPIC-PLUGIN-002 — Plugin Compliance Framework provides plugin-specific compliance mechanisms.

Security release validation SHOULD consume relevant plugin compliance evidence.

Security controls remain authoritative for security requirements while plugin compliance provides structured validation of plugin conformance.

---

## Validation and Observability

The FamilyOS Observability Framework provides runtime evidence after release.

Security validation SHOULD ensure required telemetry exists before deployment.

Post-release observability then confirms whether security assumptions remain valid in operation.

---

## Validation Governance

Security validation rules MUST be governed.

Changes to release security gates SHOULD require review when they materially change assurance.

Governance SHOULD prevent:

* silent removal of mandatory checks;
* uncontrolled severity changes;
* unapproved exceptions;
* weakened cryptographic requirements;
* bypassed compliance controls.

---

## Validation Exceptions

Validation exceptions MUST remain visible.

An exception MUST NOT modify historical validation evidence to make a failed check appear successful.

Instead:

```text
Control Result: FAIL
Exception: APPROVED
Release Decision: AUTHORIZED_WITH_EXCEPTION
```

This preserves evidence integrity.

---

## Release Security Metrics

FamilyOS MAY track security release metrics such as:

* validation pass rate;
* security findings per release;
* blocked releases;
* exception count;
* remediation time;
* dependency vulnerabilities;
* security regression frequency.

Metrics SHOULD support improvement rather than encourage bypassing controls.

---

## Continuous Improvement

Release validation SHOULD evolve based on:

* incidents;
* escaped vulnerabilities;
* failed releases;
* new threats;
* new architecture;
* new plugins;
* operational evidence.

Every significant security failure SHOULD be considered as potential input for improved validation.

---

## Validation Invariants

The following invariants apply across FamilyOS:

1. every security-relevant release MUST have an identifiable release state;
2. validation scope MUST correspond to release scope;
3. mandatory security validation MUST NOT be silently skipped;
4. missing required evidence MUST NOT be interpreted as success;
5. unresolved critical findings MUST normally block release;
6. exposed production secrets MUST block ordinary release;
7. security exceptions MUST be explicit and approved;
8. released artifacts MUST correspond to validated source;
9. important artifacts SHOULD have verifiable integrity;
10. plugin security compliance MUST be validated where applicable;
11. failed controls MUST be revalidated after remediation;
12. release credentials MUST remain protected;

## Canonical Security Release Flow

The canonical FamilyOS security release process is:

```text
                     Source Change
                          │
                          ▼
                   Security Impact

               Compliance Validation
                          │
                          ▼
                  Controlled Build

                          │
              ┌───────────┴───────────┐
              ▼                       ▼
            PASS                    BLOCK
              │                       │
              ▼                       ▼
       Release Authorization      Remediation
              │                       │
              ▼                       │

              │                       │
              ▼                       │
           Deployment                 │
              │                       │
              ▼                       │
       Runtime Validation             │
              │                       │
              ▼                       │
     Security Observability           │
              │                       │
              └───────────────◄───────┘
```

This flow ensures that security assurance continues from source change through release and runtime operation.

## Release Readiness Model

A FamilyOS release is security-ready only when:

```text
Security Architecture
        +
Security Controls
        +
Security Tests
        +
Security Compliance
        +
Dependency Assurance
        +
Secret Assurance
        +
Plugin Assurance
        +
Artifact Integrity
        +
Security Evidence
        +
Approved Risk State
        │
        ▼
SECURITY RELEASE READY
```

No individual validation mechanism is sufficient on its own.

## Expected Outcomes

The FamilyOS Security Validation and Release model enables:

* repeatable security validation;
* early security feedback;
* explicit release security gates;
* protected release pipelines;
* controlled artifact generation;
* dependency assurance;
* plugin security validation;
* secret exposure prevention;
* cryptographic validation;
* artifact integrity verification;
* release provenance;
* evidence-based release authorization;
* governed security exceptions;
* safe rollback;
* post-release verification;
* continuous security improvement.

## Final Principle

FamilyOS security validation and release governance are based on the following principle:

> A release is security-ready only when the exact state being released has been validated against its applicable security requirements, supported by trustworthy evidence, passed the required security gates, and received the authorization appropriate to its risk.

Security validation establishes confidence.

Security evidence makes that confidence verifiable.

Security gates prevent unacceptable risk from silently entering a release.

Release governance ensures that the final decision remains explicit, traceable, and accountable.

Together, these mechanisms preserve FamilyOS security guarantees from implementation through build, release, deployment, and continued operation.
