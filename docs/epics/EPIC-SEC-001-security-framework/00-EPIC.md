# Security Framework

## EPIC-SEC-001

### Security Framework

### Overview

EPIC-SEC-001 — Security Framework establishes the official cross-cutting security foundation for the FamilyOS ecosystem.

The framework defines how FamilyOS protects information, capabilities, identities, secrets, software, plugins, integrations, configuration, runtime operations, and engineering evidence.

Security is treated as a permanent architectural responsibility rather than an isolated feature, plugin, infrastructure concern, or final verification activity.

The framework establishes common rules for:

* trust;
* authentication;
* authorization;
* least privilege;
* data protection;
* secret management;
* cryptography;
* threat modeling;
* risk management;
* security controls;
* plugin security;
* compliance;
* validation;
* automation.

Its objective is to provide the smallest coherent security architecture required for secure FamilyOS implementation and future operation.

---

## Purpose

The Security Framework provides the foundation required to:

* protect FamilyOS information;
* protect family data and digital assets;
* establish explicit trust boundaries;
* authenticate actors and systems;
* authorize protected operations;
* enforce least privilege;
* protect credentials and secrets;
* establish safe cryptographic practices;
* identify security threats;
* evaluate security risks;
* define proportional controls;
* secure plugin participation;
* validate security behavior;
* generate security evidence;
* support automated security gates.

The framework does not attempt to deploy every possible cybersecurity technology.

It defines the architectural contracts and security invariants upon which implementation can safely evolve.

---

## Problem Statement

FamilyOS is designed as an extensible platform capable of managing long-lived digital family information and capabilities.

Its architecture includes:

```text
Actors
  │
  ▼
Interfaces
  │
  ▼
Application Services
  │
  ▼
Capabilities
  │
  ▼
Plugins
  │
  ▼
Repositories
  │
  ▼
Data / External Integrations
```

Every transition can create a security boundary.

Without a unified security framework, different components could independently define:

* identity handling;
* authentication;
* authorization;
* permission semantics;
* trust assumptions;
* secret storage;
* cryptographic behavior;
* input validation;
* security events;
* plugin privileges.

This would result in fragmented and potentially contradictory security guarantees.

EPIC-SEC-001 prevents that fragmentation by defining common security behavior across FamilyOS.

---

## Vision

The FamilyOS security vision is:

> Every protected FamilyOS operation should execute within explicit trust boundaries, under appropriate authorization, with minimal privilege, protected information, and verifiable security controls.

Security must be understandable.

Security must be testable.

Security must be observable.

Security must fail safely.

Security must remain proportional to actual risk.

---

## Core Security Model

FamilyOS security is built around the relationship:

```text
Actor
  ↓
Identity
  ↓
Authentication
  ↓
Security Context
  ↓
Authorization
  ↓
Capability
  ↓
Protected Resource
```

Each stage has a distinct responsibility.

Identity identifies an actor.

Authentication establishes confidence in that identity.

Security context carries relevant security state.

Authorization determines whether the requested action is permitted.

Capabilities define meaningful execution boundaries.

Protected resources remain inaccessible without applicable authorization.

---

## Core Security Properties

FamilyOS security protects several fundamental properties:

```text
Confidentiality
      +
Integrity
      +
Availability
      +
Authenticity
      +
Authorization
      +
Accountability
      =
Trustworthy FamilyOS
```

These properties are complementary.

No single mechanism provides complete security.

---

## Confidentiality

Confidentiality protects information from unauthorized disclosure.

FamilyOS may process sensitive information including:

* family records;
* documents;
* communications;
* identity information;
* financial information;
* educational information;
* security configuration;
* credentials.

Protected information must only be exposed according to explicit security rules.

---

## Integrity

Integrity protects information, configuration, software, security policy, and evidence against unauthorized or unintended modification.

FamilyOS SHOULD ensure that significant changes occur through controlled and validated mechanisms.

---

## Availability

Security includes protecting FamilyOS capabilities against disruption.

Relevant threats may include:

* resource exhaustion;
* malicious input;
* dependency failure;
* excessive retries;
* plugin failures;
* invalid security configuration;
* denial-of-service behavior.

Availability controls must remain proportional to real operational needs.

---

## Explicit Trust

FamilyOS uses an explicit-trust model.

The following assumptions are rejected:

```text
Internal      ≠ Trusted
Authenticated ≠ Authorized
Official      ≠ Unrestricted
Configured    ≠ Safe
```

Trust must be intentional, scoped, and justified.

---

## Trust Boundaries

Important trust boundaries may include:

```text
User
  ↓
FamilyOS

FamilyOS Core
  ↓
Plugin

Capability
  ↓
Repository

FamilyOS
  ↓
External Integration

Component
  ↓
Secret Provider

Build
  ↓
Release Artifact
```

Security requirements should be applied where trust assumptions change.

---

## Secure by Design

Security SHOULD be considered during:

```text
Architecture
    ↓
Design
    ↓
Implementation
    ↓
Testing
    ↓
Build
    ↓
Release
    ↓
Runtime
```

Security introduced only after implementation is more difficult to enforce consistently.

---

## Secure by Default

FamilyOS SHOULD select safe behavior when configuration or security context is incomplete.

Examples include:

```text
Missing authorization
        ↓
       DENY
```

```text
Unsafe external capability
        ↓
Disabled until explicitly configured
```

Security should not depend on hidden hardening steps.

---

## Deny by Default

Protected operations MUST NOT be executed unless authorization requirements are satisfied.

The default state is:

```text
NOT EXPLICITLY ALLOWED
        ↓
       DENIED
```

Uncertain security state must not silently become permission.

---

## Least Privilege

Actors and components SHOULD receive only the privileges required for their responsibilities.

Privileges should remain:

```text
Minimal
Scoped
Explicit
Reviewable
Revocable
```

Broad permanent access should be avoided.

---

## Authentication

Authentication establishes confidence in actor identity.

Potential FamilyOS actors include:

```text
Person
Service
Plugin
Automation
External Integration
System Process
```

The framework remains independent of specific identity providers.

---

## Authorization

Authorization determines whether an authenticated or otherwise recognized actor may perform a protected action.

A conceptual decision is based on:

```text
Actor
  +
Permission
  +
Operation
  +
Resource
  +
Context
  =
Authorization Decision
```

Authorization must remain explicit and testable.

---

## Permissions

Permissions SHOULD represent stable security concepts.

Conceptual examples include:

```text
document.read
document.write
communication.send
plugin.activate
security.configure
```

Actual permission names and semantics must be defined consistently by implementation.

---

## Security Context

Protected execution SHOULD use an explicit security context where required.

A conceptual context may contain:

```text
actor
authentication_state
permissions
roles
security_attributes
correlation_id
```

The security context should remain execution-scoped and must not become uncontrolled global state.

---

## Data Protection

FamilyOS data protection spans the applicable data lifecycle:

```text
Creation
   ↓
Processing
   ↓
Storage
   ↓
Transmission
   ↓
Backup
   ↓
Archive
   ↓
Deletion
```

Security controls should remain appropriate to the sensitivity and lifecycle of the data.

---

## Data Minimization

FamilyOS SHOULD process and expose only the information necessary for a given operation.

Reducing unnecessary data propagation reduces:

* confidentiality risk;
* privacy risk;
* observability risk;
* integration risk;
* storage exposure.

---

## Data Classification

FamilyOS MAY classify data according to sensitivity.

A conceptual model is:

```text
Public
Internal
Sensitive
Restricted
```

Exact classifications may evolve with implementation requirements.

---

## Secrets

Secrets include values that grant or protect access.

Examples include:

* passwords;
* API keys;
* authentication tokens;
* encryption keys;
* signing keys;
* private keys;
* recovery secrets.

Secrets MUST NOT be treated as ordinary configuration.

---

## Secret Management

Components SHOULD access secrets through controlled contracts.

Conceptually:

```text
Component
   ↓
Secret Reference
   ↓
Secret Provider
   ↓
Protected Secret
```

Secrets MUST NOT be committed to source control.

---

## Cryptography

FamilyOS may use cryptography to provide:

* confidentiality;
* integrity;
* authenticity;
* signing;
* verification;
* secure transport.

FamilyOS MUST NOT invent custom cryptographic algorithms.

Established and reviewed implementations must be used.

---

## Cryptographic Agility

Cryptographic implementations and algorithms evolve over time.

FamilyOS SHOULD therefore avoid unnecessary coupling to specific algorithms or providers.

Conceptually:

```text
FamilyOS Contract
       ↓
Cryptographic Adapter
       ↓
Approved Implementation
```

---

## Threat Model

FamilyOS security is threat-driven.

The framework identifies relevant threats against:

* identities;
* permissions;
* data;
* secrets;
* plugins;
* configuration;
* dependencies;
* integrations;
* observability;
* availability.

Threat modeling should remain actionable and proportional.

---

## Risk Model

FamilyOS uses a lightweight risk model:

```text
Likelihood
    ×
Impact
    =
Risk
```

A simple severity classification is:

```text
LOW
MEDIUM
HIGH
CRITICAL
```

The objective is consistent prioritization rather than mathematical precision.

---

## Risk Treatment

Security risks may be:

```text
Mitigated
Avoided
Transferred
Accepted
```

Significant risk acceptance must remain explicit.

Unresolved risk must not become accepted through silence.

---

## Security Controls

FamilyOS security controls may be:

```text
Preventive
Detective
Corrective
```

Examples include:

* authentication;
* authorization;
* input validation;
* encryption;
* secret isolation;
* security events;
* dependency checks;
* security tests;
* recovery mechanisms.

Controls should map to identifiable threats.

---

## Defense in Depth

FamilyOS SHOULD apply layered protection where risks justify it.

Conceptually:

```text
Authentication
      ↓
Authorization
      ↓
Input Validation
      ↓
Capability Boundary
      ↓
Data Protection
      ↓
Security Observability
```

Failure of one control should not automatically compromise the entire system.

---

## Input Validation

Input crossing a trust boundary MUST be treated as untrusted until validated.

Validation may include:

* structure;
* type;
* length;
* format;
* allowed values;
* semantic constraints.

Validation is not a substitute for authorization.

---

## Output Protection

Security applies to output as well as input.

FamilyOS SHOULD prevent unauthorized information exposure through:

* responses;
* logs;
* traces;
* diagnostics;
* errors;
* exports.

---

## Plugin Security

Plugins are important security boundaries.

Plugins may interact with:

* capabilities;
* repositories;
* secrets;
* external systems;
* protected family information;
* observability.

Plugins MUST NOT automatically receive unrestricted platform access.

---

## Official Plugins

Official plugins remain subject to platform security rules.

The principle is:

```text
Official
   ≠
Unrestricted
```

Official status may influence trust policy but does not bypass security invariants.

---

## Third-Party Plugins

Third-party plugins SHOULD be treated as stronger trust boundaries.

Applicable controls may include:

* declared capabilities;
* declared permissions;
* configuration validation;
* dependency validation;
* restricted interfaces;
* Plugin Compliance checks.

---

## Relationship With the Security Plugin

FamilyOS already contains a Security Plugin architecture associated with RFC-0010.

EPIC-SEC-001 does not replace that plugin.

The responsibilities are distinct:

```text
Security Framework
       ↓
Defines universal platform security rules

Security Plugin
       ↓
Provides extensible security-domain capabilities
```

The Security Plugin operates under the Security Framework.

---

## Plugin Compliance

The Plugin Compliance Framework may enforce security requirements established by EPIC-SEC-001.

Potential checks include:

```text
permission declarations
secret handling
safe observability
configuration safety
dependency rules
protected capability access
```

This avoids creating a second compliance system.

---

## External Integration Security

External systems represent independent trust domains.

FamilyOS integrations SHOULD consider:

* authentication;
* authorization;
* credential protection;
* transport security;
* input validation;
* output validation;
* timeouts;
* failure isolation;
* data minimization.

External trust must never be assumed implicitly.

---

## Configuration Security

Security-sensitive configuration MUST be validated.

Invalid security configuration must not silently disable required controls.

Conceptually:

```text
Invalid Security Configuration
          ↓
      Explicit Failure
```

rather than:

```text
Invalid Security Configuration
          ↓
      Security Disabled
```

---

## Dependency Security

External dependencies are part of the FamilyOS attack surface.

Dependency security SHOULD consider:

* necessity;
* provenance;
* version governance;
* vulnerability exposure;
* transitive dependencies;
* integrity.

Existing Build and Quality mechanisms should be reused where applicable.

---

## Supply-Chain Security

FamilyOS security applies throughout:

```text
Source
   ↓
Dependencies
   ↓
Build
   ↓
Validation
   ↓
Artifact
   ↓
Release
```

EPIC-SEC-001 consumes the Build and Release frameworks instead of duplicating their lifecycle.

---

## Security Observability

The Observability Framework provides runtime mechanisms that security may consume.

Security-relevant events may include:

```text
authentication.failed
authorization.denied
security.configuration.invalid
plugin.permission.denied
secret.access.failed
integrity.validation.failed
```

Security telemetry must remain privacy-safe.

---

## Security Events

Important security decisions SHOULD produce structured evidence where appropriate.

A conceptual security event may include:

```text
event_name
timestamp
component
actor_reference
operation
outcome
reason_category
correlation_id
```

Sensitive values must remain excluded.

---

## Security Findings

Automated validation SHOULD support structured security findings.

Conceptually:

```text
identifier
category
severity
component
evidence
remediation
status
```

Findings should support both human review and automated lifecycle decisions.

---

## Security Testing

Security requirements SHOULD become executable tests wherever practical.

Testing may include:

* authentication tests;
* authorization tests;
* negative permission tests;
* invalid-input tests;
* secret-leak tests;
* plugin-boundary tests;
* configuration tests;
* security-event tests.

Security must not rely exclusively on manual review.

---

## Negative Testing

Testing denied behavior is essential.

For example:

```text
Permission Present
      ↓
ALLOW

Permission Missing
      ↓
DENY

Invalid Security Context
      ↓
DENY
```

Both positive and negative behavior provide security evidence.

---

## Security Automation

Stable security contracts enable automation.

Potential automated capabilities include:

* secret detection;
* dependency checks;
* permission verification;
* configuration validation;
* plugin compliance;
* security regression tests;
* release gates.

Automation should consume structured security contracts.

---

## Security Gates

Security validation may affect lifecycle decisions.

Conceptually:

```text
Security Findings
       ↓
Risk Classification
       ↓
Gate Policy
       ↓
PASS / REVIEW / BLOCK
```

Critical security findings SHOULD normally block release until resolved or explicitly governed.

---

## Integration With Quality

Security findings may become Quality Framework evidence.

Security defects are quality defects with security-specific consequences.

---

## Integration With Build

The Build Framework provides artifact and dependency foundations.

Security may add:

* secret exclusion;
* dependency validation;
* supply-chain checks;
* artifact integrity requirements.

---

## Integration With Release

The Release Framework provides publication control.

Security validation may act as a release gate for critical requirements.

---

## Integration With Observability

The Observability Framework provides security-relevant runtime evidence.

Security should use the existing observability architecture rather than inventing a parallel telemetry system.

---

## Integration With Operations

The future Operations Framework will consume both security and observability.

Conceptually:

```text
Security
    │
    ├─────────┐
    │         │
    ▼         ▼
Controls   Evidence
    │         │
    └────┬────┘
         ▼
     Operations
```

---

## Core Security Primitives

The initial implementation SHOULD prioritize a small set of stable primitives:

```text
SecurityContext
Permission
AuthorizationRequest
AuthorizationDecision
SecurityEvent
SecurityFinding
SecretReference
```

Additional abstractions should only be introduced when implementation requires them.

---

## Minimal Initial Implementation

The minimum useful FamilyOS security implementation is:

```text
SecurityContext
       +
Permission Model
       +
Authorization Contract
       +
Deny-by-Default Enforcement
       +
Secret Provider Contract
       +
Security Events
       +
Security Tests
```

This provides substantial protection without requiring enterprise-scale infrastructure.

---

## Implementation Sequence

Security implementation SHOULD progress incrementally:

```text
Security Models
      ↓
Authorization
      ↓
Secret Management
      ↓
Security Events
      ↓
Plugin Security
      ↓
Validation
      ↓
CI Automation
      ↓
Release Gates
```

---

## Vendor Neutrality

Core FamilyOS security contracts SHOULD remain independent of specific security vendors.

The architecture should follow:

```text
FamilyOS
   ↓
Security Contract
   ↓
Adapter
   ↓
External Provider
```

Provider choice must not leak into domain architecture unnecessarily.

---

## Local Development

Security architecture must remain usable in local development and automated tests.

FamilyOS should support deterministic:

* local authorization;
* test identities;
* synthetic secrets;
* in-memory providers.

Local development simplicity must not require disabling fundamental security invariants.

---

## Engineering Quality

Applicable security implementation must continue to satisfy FamilyOS engineering standards.

At minimum:

```text
Ruff
MyPy
Pytest
```

must pass for affected implementation scope.

Security-specific tooling may be introduced only where it provides clear engineering value.

---

## Documentation Strategy

EPIC-SEC-001 uses the compact FamilyOS documentation model.

The canonical document set is:

```text
00-EPIC.md
01-Context-and-Vision.md
02-Security-Principles.md
03-Security-Architecture.md
04-Identity-Authentication-and-Authorization.md
05-Data-Secrets-and-Cryptography.md
06-Threat-Risk-and-Trust-Model.md
07-Security-Controls-and-Compliance.md
08-Implementation-and-Automation.md
09-Validation-and-Release.md
```

No additional framework documents are required unless implementation reveals a concrete architectural gap.

---

## Deliverables

EPIC-SEC-001 delivers:

* security context and vision;
* security principles;
* platform security architecture;
* identity-security integration;
* authentication requirements;
* authorization architecture;
* data-protection requirements;
* secret-management architecture;
* cryptographic principles;
* threat model;
* risk model;
* trust model;
* security controls;
* compliance integration;
* implementation strategy;
* automation strategy;
* validation and release requirements.

---

## Out of Scope

EPIC-SEC-001 does not require immediate implementation of:

* enterprise IAM;
* a Security Operations Center;
* enterprise SIEM;
* hardware security modules;
* complete zero-trust infrastructure;
* custom cryptographic algorithms;
* enterprise policy engines;
* full automated penetration testing;
* every future compliance certification.

These capabilities may be introduced later when justified by concrete requirements.

---

## Definition of Done

EPIC-SEC-001 is complete when:

* all 10 canonical documents are present;
* all documents reference `EPIC-SEC-001`;
* trust boundaries are defined;
* security principles are established;
* authentication and authorization responsibilities are clear;
* data-protection requirements are defined;
* secret-management requirements are defined;
* cryptographic principles are defined;
* threat, risk, and trust models are established;
* platform controls are defined;
* plugin-security expectations are defined;
* implementation strategy is defined;
* automated validation strategy is defined;
* release requirements are defined;
* no unresolved architectural blocker prevents implementation.

---

## Post-EPIC Rule

After EPIC-SEC-001 is validated, documentation expansion stops unless implementation exposes a real architectural gap.

The workflow becomes:

```text
Security Framework
       ↓
Implementation
       ↓
Security Tests
       ↓
Validation
       ↓
Quality Gates
       ↓
Release
```

The objective is working, enforceable security.

---

## Success Criteria

EPIC-SEC-001 succeeds when FamilyOS can answer:

```text
What is being protected?

Who is acting?

How is identity established?

What is the actor allowed to do?

Where does trust change?

Which data is sensitive?

How are secrets protected?

Which threat exists?

What is the risk?

Which control mitigates it?

How is the control tested?

What evidence proves it worked?

Can security affect release decisions?
```

---

## Expected Outcome

After EPIC-SEC-001, FamilyOS will possess a coherent platform security model that is:

```text
Secure by Design
Secure by Default
Deny by Default
Least Privilege
Explicit Trust
Threat-Driven
Data-Protective
Secret-Safe
Cryptographically Sound
Plugin-Aware
Observable
Testable
Automatable
Vendor-Neutral
Proportional
```

This foundation prepares FamilyOS for secure implementation and future operational use.
