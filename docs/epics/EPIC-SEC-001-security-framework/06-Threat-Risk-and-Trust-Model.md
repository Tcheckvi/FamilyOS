# Security Framework

## EPIC-SEC-001

### Threat, Risk, and Trust Model

### Overview

This document defines the FamilyOS threat model, security risk model, and trust model.

These three concepts are closely related but distinct:

```text
Threat
  → What could go wrong?

Risk
  → How serious would it be?

Trust
  → Which relationships and boundaries can be relied upon?
```

The purpose of this model is to ensure that FamilyOS security controls are driven by identifiable threats and explicit trust assumptions rather than by arbitrary tooling or generalized fear.

The model is intentionally practical.

It provides enough structure to guide architecture, implementation, testing, plugin security, release decisions, and future operations without introducing unnecessary security bureaucracy.

---

## Objectives

The Threat, Risk, and Trust Model must:

* identify important assets;
* identify relevant actors;
* define trust boundaries;
* identify likely threat categories;
* support consistent risk evaluation;
* guide control selection;
* support plugin risk analysis;
* support integration risk analysis;
* support security testing;
* support release decisions;
* support future operational security.

---

## Security Assets

A security asset is anything whose confidentiality, integrity, availability, authenticity, or controlled use matters to FamilyOS.

FamilyOS assets may include:

* family information;
* personal information;
* documents;
* communications;
* financial records;
* educational records;
* identities;
* credentials;
* cryptographic keys;
* permissions;
* configuration;
* plugins;
* workflows;
* repositories;
* application state;
* audit evidence;
* build artifacts;
* release artifacts;
* security policies.

---

## Asset Categories

FamilyOS assets may be grouped conceptually as:

```text
Data Assets
Identity Assets
Security Assets
Runtime Assets
Software Assets
Configuration Assets
Operational Evidence
```

This classification helps identify different kinds of threats.

---

## Data Assets

Data assets include information processed or stored by FamilyOS.

Examples include:

```text
family records
documents
messages
financial information
education information
metadata
historical records
```

Threats may include:

* unauthorized disclosure;
* unauthorized modification;
* deletion;
* corruption;
* unintended exposure.

---

## Identity Assets

Identity assets describe who or what participates in FamilyOS.

Examples include:

```text
person identity
family membership
service identity
plugin identity
integration identity
```

Threats may include:

* impersonation;
* identity spoofing;
* unauthorized association;
* privilege escalation.

---

## Security Assets

Security assets directly support protection mechanisms.

Examples include:

```text
credentials
tokens
keys
permissions
security policies
authorization decisions
security configuration
```

Compromise of these assets may undermine multiple security controls simultaneously.

---

## Software Assets

Software assets include:

* source code;
* plugins;
* packages;
* dependencies;
* build outputs;
* release artifacts.

Threats may include:

* tampering;
* malicious dependency introduction;
* compromised packages;
* unauthorized modification;
* supply-chain attack.

---

## Operational Evidence

Observability and security evidence may itself become security-sensitive.

Examples include:

```text
security events
audit records
trace context
release evidence
validation results
```

Threats include:

* tampering;
* deletion;
* misleading evidence;
* unauthorized disclosure.

---

## Actors

Threat modeling begins by identifying relevant actors.

FamilyOS actors may include:

```text
Legitimate User
Family Member
Administrator
Developer
Plugin
Automation
Service
External Integration
Unknown External Actor
Compromised Component
Malicious Plugin
```

Actors should not be classified as trusted or untrusted solely by name.

Trust depends on context and boundary.

---

## Legitimate Actors

Legitimate actors are expected to use FamilyOS according to intended permissions.

They may still cause security problems through:

* mistakes;
* excessive permissions;
* compromised credentials;
* incorrect configuration;
* unintended data exposure.

Threat modeling therefore includes misuse as well as malicious behavior.

---

## External Actors

External actors may attempt to interact with FamilyOS without valid authorization.

Potential behaviors include:

* authentication attacks;
* input manipulation;
* service abuse;
* exploitation attempts;
* denial of service;
* credential attacks.

The model assumes external input is untrusted.

---

## Compromised Actors

A legitimate identity or component may become compromised.

Examples include:

```text
stolen credential
compromised plugin
malicious dependency
compromised integration
infected development environment
```

FamilyOS SHOULD therefore avoid assuming that prior trust guarantees permanent safety.

---

## Threat Sources

Threats may originate from:

* external attackers;
* compromised credentials;
* malicious insiders;
* vulnerable dependencies;
* third-party plugins;
* misconfiguration;
* implementation defects;
* unsafe automation;
* compromised integrations;
* supply-chain compromise;
* accidental misuse.

Not every threat requires malicious intent.

---

## Trust Model

Trust defines what security assumptions FamilyOS permits between components and actors.

FamilyOS uses an explicit-trust model.

The core rule is:

> Trust must be granted intentionally and scoped to the required relationship.

---

## Trust Is Contextual

An actor may be trusted for one operation and untrusted for another.

For example:

```text
Family Member
    │
    ├── may read shared calendar
    │
    └── may not read restricted financial record
```

Trust therefore cannot be represented by a single global boolean value.

---

## Trust Is Scoped

Trust SHOULD be limited according to:

* operation;
* resource;
* capability;
* duration;
* context.

This aligns trust with least privilege.

---

## Trust Boundaries

A trust boundary exists when security assumptions change.

Important FamilyOS trust boundaries include:

```text
User
  ↓
FamilyOS Interface

FamilyOS Core
  ↓
Plugin

Application
  ↓
Repository

FamilyOS
  ↓
External Integration

Component
  ↓
Secret Provider

Build
  ↓
Release Artifact
```

Each boundary should define expected validation and authorization behavior.

---

## User-to-Platform Boundary

User-provided input crosses a major trust boundary.

FamilyOS must assume that input may be:

* malformed;
* malicious;
* oversized;
* unauthorized;
* semantically invalid.

Controls may include:

* authentication;
* validation;
* authorization;
* rate limiting;
* safe error handling.

---

## Core-to-Plugin Boundary

Plugins operate within FamilyOS but may introduce code and dependencies outside the core platform.

The boundary requires consideration of:

* plugin identity;
* declared capabilities;
* required permissions;
* configuration;
* external access;
* observability;
* dependency risk.

Third-party plugins require stronger scrutiny than core components.

---

## Application-to-Repository Boundary

Repositories control access to persisted information.

Threats include:

* unauthorized queries;
* identifier manipulation;
* bypassed authorization;
* data corruption;
* unsafe filtering.

Authorization should generally be established before access reaches lower-level storage mechanisms.

---

## External Integration Boundary

External systems MUST be treated as independent trust domains.

FamilyOS cannot assume that an external system:

* validates data correctly;
* protects credentials correctly;
* remains available;
* remains uncompromised;
* returns safe content.

Integration boundaries require explicit validation and failure isolation.

---

## Secret Provider Boundary

Secret providers represent highly sensitive trust boundaries.

Components requesting secrets must not receive arbitrary secret access.

The interface should support scoped access.

---

## Build and Release Trust Boundary

A build artifact becomes a release candidate only after successful validation.

The transition:

```text
Source
  ↓
Build
  ↓
Validated Artifact
  ↓
Release
```

is a security-relevant trust transition.

Security should be able to determine whether an artifact is sufficiently trustworthy for publication.

---

## Trust Levels

FamilyOS MAY use conceptual trust levels where useful.

A simple model may include:

```text
Untrusted
Restricted
Trusted for Specific Purpose
Privileged
```

These levels are conceptual and do not replace explicit authorization.

---

## Zero Implicit Trust

FamilyOS adopts the rule:

```text
Internal ≠ Trusted
Authenticated ≠ Authorized
Official ≠ Unlimited
Configured ≠ Safe
```

Each security property must be established independently.

---

## Threat Modeling Approach

Threat modeling SHOULD be performed at meaningful architectural boundaries.

A simple process is:

```text
Identify Asset
      ↓
Identify Actor
      ↓
Identify Boundary
      ↓
Identify Threat
      ↓
Estimate Risk
      ↓
Select Control
      ↓
Validate Control
```

This process may be applied during design and implementation reviews.

---

## Threat Categories

FamilyOS uses a compact set of threat categories.

These include:

1. identity threats;
2. authorization threats;
3. data threats;
4. secret threats;
5. plugin threats;
6. integration threats;
7. availability threats;
8. configuration threats;
9. supply-chain threats;
10. observability threats.

---

## Identity Threats

Identity threats include:

* impersonation;
* stolen credentials;
* weak authentication;
* forged identity claims;
* session abuse;
* incorrect identity association.

Controls may include:

* strong authentication;
* credential protection;
* session controls;
* explicit identity verification.

---

## Authorization Threats

Authorization threats include:

* privilege escalation;
* missing permission checks;
* overly broad roles;
* authorization bypass;
* confused-deputy behavior;
* insecure defaults.

Controls may include:

* deny by default;
* explicit permissions;
* least privilege;
* capability-level checks;
* negative security tests.

---

## Data Threats

Data threats include:

* unauthorized disclosure;
* unauthorized modification;
* deletion;
* corruption;
* accidental exposure;
* insecure export.

Controls may include:

* authorization;
* encryption;
* integrity validation;
* backups;
* safe deletion;
* data minimization.

---

## Secret Threats

Secret threats include:

* source-control leakage;
* logging leakage;
* insecure storage;
* excessive access;
* long-lived credentials;
* unsafe rotation.

Controls may include:

* secret providers;
* redaction;
* scoped access;
* rotation;
* automated secret detection.

---

## Plugin Threats

Plugins may introduce:

* malicious behavior;
* excessive privilege;
* unsafe dependencies;
* uncontrolled external communication;
* telemetry leakage;
* insecure configuration.

Controls may include:

* permission declarations;
* plugin compliance;
* restricted interfaces;
* dependency checks;
* security tests.

---

## Integration Threats

External integrations may introduce:

* malicious responses;
* credential compromise;
* invalid data;
* impersonation;
* unavailable dependencies;
* replay behavior.

Controls may include:

* authentication;
* transport protection;
* validation;
* timeouts;
* scoped credentials;
* retry controls.

---

## Availability Threats

Availability threats include:

* denial of service;
* resource exhaustion;
* unbounded workloads;
* dependency failure;
* excessive retries;
* malicious input.

Controls may include:

* limits;
* quotas;
* timeouts;
* graceful degradation;
* health checks;
* isolation.

---

## Configuration Threats

Configuration can create security failures through:

* invalid permissions;
* disabled controls;
* weak cryptographic settings;
* unsafe diagnostics;
* incorrect provider configuration.

Controls include:

* validation;
* secure defaults;
* fail-safe startup;
* configuration tests.

---

## Supply-Chain Threats

Supply-chain threats include:

* compromised dependencies;
* malicious packages;
* tampered build systems;
* artifact replacement;
* unreviewed dependency introduction.

Controls may include:

* dependency governance;
* locked versions;
* reproducible builds;
* artifact integrity;
* release validation.

---

## Observability Threats

Observability may create risk through:

* secret leakage;
* private-data leakage;
* insecure diagnostic output;
* telemetry tampering;
* excessive exposure.

Controls are defined jointly with the Observability Framework.

---

## Threat Scenarios

Threat models SHOULD use concrete scenarios when possible.

Example:

```text
Threat:
Unauthorized plugin reads restricted family data.

Asset:
Restricted family document.

Actor:
Third-party plugin.

Boundary:
Plugin → protected capability.

Risk:
Confidentiality breach.

Control:
Explicit permission required.

Validation:
Negative plugin authorization test.
```

This format keeps security analysis actionable.

---

## Risk Model

Risk represents the significance of a threat.

A lightweight FamilyOS model is:

```text
Likelihood × Impact = Risk
```

The purpose is prioritization, not mathematical precision.

---

## Likelihood

Likelihood represents how plausible it is that a threat will occur.

A simple scale may be:

```text
LOW
MEDIUM
HIGH
```

Likelihood may consider:

* exposure;
* complexity;
* exploitability;
* attacker capability;
* historical evidence.

---

## Impact

Impact represents potential harm.

A simple scale may be:

```text
LOW
MEDIUM
HIGH
CRITICAL
```

Impact may include effects on:

* confidentiality;
* integrity;
* availability;
* trust;
* family data;
* system operation;
* recovery cost.

---

## Risk Classification

FamilyOS MAY use a simple matrix:

```text
                 Impact
              L   M   H   C
Likelihood
LOW           L   L   M   H
MEDIUM        L   M   H   C
HIGH          M   H   C   C
```

Where:

```text
L = Low
M = Medium
H = High
C = Critical
```

The exact matrix may evolve if implementation needs more precision.

---

## Critical Risk

A critical risk generally represents a condition capable of causing severe compromise of:

* sensitive family information;
* platform security;
* authorization integrity;
* secret confidentiality;
* release integrity.

Critical risks SHOULD normally block release or activation until resolved or explicitly accepted through governance.

---

## High Risk

High risks require remediation or explicit review before affected functionality progresses toward release.

---

## Medium Risk

Medium risks should be tracked and remediated proportionally.

They may not always require immediate release blocking.

---

## Low Risk

Low risks may be accepted temporarily when the cost of immediate remediation exceeds the practical benefit.

Acceptance should remain intentional.

---

## Risk Treatment

FamilyOS recognizes four common risk treatments:

```text
Mitigate
Avoid
Transfer
Accept
```

---

## Mitigate

Mitigation reduces likelihood or impact through controls.

Example:

```text
Threat:
Secret exposed through logs

Control:
Telemetry redaction + tests
```

---

## Avoid

Avoidance removes the risky behavior entirely.

Example:

```text
Risky capability not required
      ↓
Capability not implemented
```

---

## Transfer

Some risk may be transferred contractually or operationally to external providers.

Transfer does not eliminate FamilyOS responsibility to evaluate the remaining risk.

---

## Accept

Risk acceptance acknowledges that a known residual risk remains.

Significant risk acceptance SHOULD be explicit.

Security risks must not be accepted accidentally through inaction.

---

## Residual Risk

Controls reduce risk but rarely eliminate it completely.

The risk remaining after controls is residual risk.

Conceptually:

```text
Initial Risk
     ↓
Security Controls
     ↓
Residual Risk
```

Residual risk must be acceptable for the intended use.

---

## Control Selection

Security controls SHOULD be selected according to risk.

The preferred model is:

```text
Threat
  ↓
Risk
  ↓
Control Objective
  ↓
Security Control
  ↓
Validation
```

Tool choice comes after the control objective is understood.

---

## Preventive Controls

Preventive controls reduce the probability of a security event.

Examples:

* authentication;
* authorization;
* input validation;
* encryption;
* least privilege;
* secure defaults.

---

## Detective Controls

Detective controls identify security-relevant behavior.

Examples:

* structured security events;
* failed-authentication monitoring;
* dependency vulnerability detection;
* integrity checks.

---

## Corrective Controls

Corrective controls help restore safe operation.

Examples:

* credential rotation;
* revocation;
* dependency upgrade;
* configuration rollback;
* plugin disablement.

---

## Compensating Controls

A compensating control MAY be used when an ideal primary control cannot yet be implemented.

Compensating controls should be documented and treated as temporary where appropriate.

---

## Trust and Authorization

Trust does not replace authorization.

Even within a trusted context, protected operations may require explicit authorization.

Conceptually:

```text
Trusted Actor
      ↓
Authorization Check
      ↓
Allowed Capability
```

Trust may influence policy but does not remove the policy decision.

---

## Trust and Identity

Identity is a prerequisite for many trust decisions.

However, verified identity only establishes who the actor is.

Additional context determines what the actor may do.

---

## Trust and Plugins

Plugin trust SHOULD consider factors such as:

* origin;
* signing or verification;
* compliance status;
* permissions;
* dependency profile;
* requested capabilities;
* external communication.

Trust should remain scoped.

---

## Trust and Dependencies

Dependencies are trusted only for specific purposes.

The presence of a dependency in the project does not justify unrestricted access to platform state or secrets.

---

## Trust and External Services

External services must be trusted only according to defined contracts.

FamilyOS should not assume external providers have equivalent security guarantees.

Trust decisions should include failure and compromise scenarios.

---

## Trust Revocation

Trust may need to be revoked.

Examples include:

* compromised credential;
* malicious plugin;
* vulnerable dependency;
* invalid integration;
* expired authorization.

Architecture SHOULD support revocation where practical.

---

## Temporal Trust

Some trust decisions should be time-bound.

Examples include:

* session authentication;
* temporary tokens;
* short-lived credentials;
* temporary permissions.

Permanent trust should not be the default when limited-duration trust is sufficient.

---

## Security Assumptions

Threat models rely on assumptions.

Important assumptions SHOULD be explicit.

Examples may include:

```text
Operating system provides process isolation.

Approved cryptographic libraries behave correctly.

Source-control access is restricted.

Build environment follows defined controls.
```

Assumptions should be revisited when architecture changes.

---

## Assumption Failure

FamilyOS SHOULD consider what happens when important assumptions fail.

For example:

```text
Assumption:
Plugin is trusted.

Failure:
Plugin becomes compromised.

Question:
What limits the blast radius?
```

This supports defense-in-depth design.

---

## Blast Radius

Security architecture SHOULD limit how much damage one compromised component can cause.

Controls may include:

* narrow permissions;
* isolated secrets;
* restricted capabilities;
* data segmentation;
* plugin boundaries.

The objective is not perfect isolation but proportional containment.

---

## Abuse Cases

Threat modeling SHOULD include abuse cases in addition to normal use cases.

Examples:

```text
Unauthorized user attempts document export.

Plugin requests capability outside declared permissions.

Integration sends oversized payload.

Actor repeatedly attempts authentication.

Component attempts to access unrelated secret.
```

Abuse cases translate threat models into tests.

---

## Threat-to-Test Mapping

Important threats SHOULD map to executable security tests where practical.

Example:

```text
Threat
  ↓
Unauthorized access
  ↓
Control
  ↓
Permission check
  ↓
Test
  ↓
Unauthorized actor receives DENIED
```

This turns threat modeling into engineering evidence.

---

## Threat-to-Observability Mapping

Important security threats SHOULD also identify required runtime evidence.

For example:

```text
Threat:
Repeated authorization bypass attempt

Evidence:
authorization.denied
correlation_id
operation
reason_category
```

This supports future detection and operations.

---

## Risk and Release Gates

Security risk may influence release decisions.

Conceptually:

```text
Security Finding
      ↓
Risk Classification
      ↓
Release Policy
```

Possible outcomes include:

```text
Low       → release permitted
Medium    → review
High      → remediation expected
Critical  → release blocked
```

Exact governance is defined by security controls and release policy.

---

## Risk and Plugin Activation

Plugin security risk may also affect plugin activation.

For example:

```text
Plugin Compliance
      ↓
Security Finding
      ↓
Risk Evaluation
      ↓
Activate / Restrict / Reject
```

This model may evolve as the plugin ecosystem grows.

---

## Risk Ownership

Important risks SHOULD have an identifiable owner.

Ownership includes responsibility for:

* understanding the risk;
* selecting treatment;
* tracking remediation;
* reviewing acceptance.

Risk ownership prevents unresolved findings from becoming invisible.

---

## Risk Review

Risks SHOULD be reviewed when:

* architecture changes;
* trust boundaries change;
* new plugins are introduced;
* external integrations change;
* sensitive data scope expands;
* security incidents reveal new threats.

Risk documentation should remain current enough to support decisions.

---

## Threat Model Evolution

Threat models are not static.

They SHOULD evolve with the system.

The process is:

```text
Architecture Change
       ↓
Boundary Change
       ↓
Threat Review
       ↓
Risk Review
       ↓
Control Update
```

This should occur proportionally rather than as a large recurring documentation exercise.

---

## Minimal Threat Model

The initial FamilyOS implementation does not require a complex formal threat-modeling platform.

A lightweight threat record may contain:

```text
Threat ID
Asset
Actor
Boundary
Threat
Likelihood
Impact
Risk
Control
Validation
Status
```

This is sufficient for early implementation.

---

## Example Threat Record

```text
Threat ID: SEC-T001

Asset:
Restricted document

Actor:
Third-party plugin

Boundary:
Plugin → document capability

Threat:
Unauthorized read access

Likelihood:
MEDIUM

Impact:
HIGH

Risk:
HIGH

Control:
Explicit document.read permission

Validation:
Negative authorization test

Status:
MITIGATED
```

---

## Trust Review Questions

When evaluating a trust relationship, engineers SHOULD ask:

1. What is being trusted?
2. For which operation?
3. For how long?
4. Which resource is exposed?
5. What verifies the trust?
6. Can trust be revoked?
7. What happens if the trusted actor becomes compromised?
8. What limits the blast radius?

---

## Threat Review Questions

For each meaningful security boundary:

1. What asset exists here?
2. Who can interact with it?
3. What could an attacker or compromised component do?
4. What control prevents or detects that behavior?
5. How can the control fail?
6. How is the behavior tested?
7. What runtime evidence exists?

---

## Risk Review Questions

For each identified threat:

1. How likely is it?
2. What would the impact be?
3. What is the resulting risk?
4. Which control reduces the risk?
5. What residual risk remains?
6. Is that residual risk acceptable?
7. Who owns the decision?

---

## Plugin Threat Checklist

Applicable plugins SHOULD be evaluated for:

```text
Requested permissions
External communication
Secret access
Protected data access
Dependency risk
Runtime behavior
Observability behavior
Configuration safety
Compliance status
```

Not every plugin requires every control.

---

## Integration Threat Checklist

External integrations SHOULD be evaluated for:

```text
Authentication
Authorization
Credential handling
Transport protection
Input validation
Output validation
Timeouts
Retry behavior
Data minimization
Failure isolation
```

---

## Data Threat Checklist

Sensitive data flows SHOULD consider:

```text
Source
Destination
Authorization
Storage
Transmission
Logging
Backup
Deletion
Export
```

Any unexpected propagation should be treated as a security concern.

---

## Threat Model and Privacy

Threat analysis should include privacy-related security failures.

Examples include:

* excessive disclosure;
* unauthorized correlation;
* telemetry leakage;
* accidental sharing;
* unauthorized export.

Privacy risk therefore participates in the broader security risk model.

---

## Threat Model and Observability

Observability improves threat detection but can also create threats.

Security design must therefore consider both:

```text
Observability as Control
```

and:

```text
Observability as Attack Surface
```

Security events should provide useful evidence without exposing protected content.

---

## Threat Model and Automation

Future automation may consume threat and risk information.

Examples include:

* blocking critical releases;
* rejecting non-compliant plugins;
* disabling compromised integrations;
* prioritizing remediation.

Automation SHOULD depend on structured risk and validation results.

---

## Avoiding Threat Inflation

FamilyOS should not classify every theoretical possibility as critical.

Threat modeling must remain realistic.

Excessive threat inflation creates:

* unnecessary complexity;
* alert fatigue;
* ineffective prioritization;
* slower engineering.

Risk classification exists to preserve proportionality.

---

## Avoiding Risk Blindness

The opposite problem must also be avoided.

Known high-impact risks must not be ignored merely because exploitation has not yet occurred.

FamilyOS should distinguish between:

```text
No Evidence of Attack
```

and:

```text
No Security Risk
```

They are not equivalent.

---

## Security Decision Hierarchy

When evaluating threats and controls, FamilyOS SHOULD prioritize:

```text
Protection of Sensitive Family Data
              ↓
Security Invariants
              ↓
Trust Boundary Integrity
              ↓
Authorization Correctness
              ↓
Evidence Trustworthiness
              ↓
Availability
              ↓
Performance
              ↓
Convenience
```

This hierarchy applies to genuine security conflicts, not speculative over-engineering.

---

## Minimal Initial Implementation

The first implementation SHOULD support:

```text
Threat Model Structure
      +
Risk Classification
      +
Trust Boundary Definitions
      +
Security Finding Model
      +
Risk-Based Validation
```

A dedicated external threat-management product is not required.

---

## Success Criteria

This model is successful when FamilyOS can:

* identify its important assets;
* identify relevant actors;
* define explicit trust boundaries;
* describe significant threats;
* classify risks consistently;
* select proportional controls;
* map threats to tests;
* map threats to runtime evidence;
* evaluate plugin and integration risks;
* support risk-informed release decisions.

---

## Expected Outcome

After adoption of this model, security discussions should be expressible as:

```text
Asset
  ↓
Actor
  ↓
Boundary
  ↓
Threat
  ↓
Risk
  ↓
Control
  ↓
Validation
  ↓
Evidence
```

This provides a common security language across FamilyOS engineering.

---

## Conclusion

FamilyOS security should not be driven by assumptions of universal trust or by indiscriminate deployment of security tools.

The framework instead uses explicit relationships:

```text
Explicit Trust
      +
Identified Threats
      +
Proportional Risk
      +
Verified Controls
      =
Defensible Security
```

The governing principle is:

> Trust only what is required, identify what can fail, evaluate the real risk, and verify that the chosen controls work.

This Threat, Risk, and Trust Model provides the foundation for consistent security decisions throughout FamilyOS.
