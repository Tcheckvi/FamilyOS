## 1. Purpose

This document records validation requirements and execution evidence for the normalized repository representation of:

**EPIC-SEC-001 — Security Framework**

It distinguishes between:

1. historical publication;
2. historical documentation structure;
3. current normalized repository structure;
4. post-release control-document normalization;
5. current repository validation;
6. final revalidation.

Only evidence from actual execution SHALL be used to convert pending validation requirements into PASS results.

---

## 2. Historical Publication

EPIC-SEC-001 version `5.0.0` was historically published under:

```text
v5.0.0-security-framework
```

Historical publication commit:

```text
498fa16e692bf1461df2e4afba8bc4e485837a45
```

Historical publication state:

```text
Published
```

The historical publication identity SHALL remain immutable during post-release normalization.

---

## 3. Historical Tag Evidence

The historical annotated tag is:

```text
v5.0.0-security-framework
```

The authoritative dereferenced target is:

```text
498fa16e692bf1461df2e4afba8bc4e485837a45
```

Remote inspection has already shown that the remote annotated tag dereferences to the same historical commit.

Historical publication evidence therefore exists.

Current normalization SHALL later re-confirm that the relationship remains unchanged.

---

## 4. Historical Structure

The historical publication contained exactly ten numbered documents:

```text
00-EPIC.md
01-Context-and-Vision.md
02-Security-Principles.md
03-Security-Architecture.md
04-Identity-Authentication-and-Authorization.md
05-Data-Secrets-and-Cryptography.md
06-Threat-Risk-and-Trust-Model.md
07-Security-Controls-and-Compliance.md
08-Implementation-and-Automation.md
09-Validation-and-Release.md
```

Historical structure:

```text
Canonical Range:       00 → 09
Numbered Documents:    10
Control Documents:      0
Historical Files:      10
```

The current seven control documents were not part of this historical release.

---

## 5. Current Normalized Structure

The current repository representation introduces seven control documents:

```text
EPIC-SEC-001.md
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

Expected current structure:

```text
Canonical Range:       00 → 09
Numbered Documents:    10
Control Documents:      7
Canonical Files:       17
```

---

## 6. Validation State Model

Current validation uses:

```text
PENDING
PASS
FAIL
NOT APPLICABLE
```

Meaning:

| State            | Meaning                                      |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `PENDING`        | Current evidence is not yet sufficient.      |
| `PASS`           | Actual validation evidence confirms success. |
| `FAIL`           | Actual validation evidence confirms failure. |
| `NOT APPLICABLE` | Requirement is explicitly not applicable.    |

Historical success SHALL NOT automatically become current validation evidence.

---

## 7. Machine-Readable Baseline

During post-release revalidation, the expected machine-readable state is:

```yaml
baseline:
  framework_version: "5.0.0"
  documentation_status: completed
  repository_validation_status: validated
  final_validation_status: validated
```

Historical release state remains:

```yaml
release:
  historical_tag: v5.0.0-security-framework
  historical_commit: 498fa16e692bf1461df2e4afba8bc4e485837a45
  publication_status: published
  historical_tag_immutable: true
  remote_publication_verified: true

## 8. YAML Parse Validation

`EPIC.yaml` SHALL parse successfully using an actual YAML parser.

Authentication
    ≠
Authorization
```

Current result:

```text
Identity Consistency: PENDING

---

## 26. Authentication Consistency

Authentication SHALL establish or increase confidence in an asserted identity.

Authentication success SHALL NOT automatically grant unrestricted authorization.

Current result:

  +
Context
  ↓
Authorization Decision
```

Current result:

```text
Authorization Consistency: PENDING
```

---

## 55. Historical Evidence Matrix

Historical evidence already observed before normalization:

| Historical Evidence                                   | Result |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| `v5.0.0-security-framework` exists                    | PASS   |
| Tag is annotated                                      | PASS   |
| Historical tag dereferences to `498fa16e...`          | PASS   |
| Remote historical tag exists                          | PASS   |
| Remote dereferenced tag resolves to `498fa16e...`     | PASS   |
| Historical repository contained 10 numbered documents | PASS   |
| Historical repository contained 0 control documents   | PASS   |

These results describe historical publication.

They do not automatically establish current normalized repository validation.

## 56. Final Revalidation Conditions

EPIC-SEC-001 current normalization MAY become validated only when:

* YAML parsing passes;
* YAML contract passes;
* filesystem inventory passes;
* numbering passes;
* all seven control documents exist;
* no required canonical file is empty;
* manifest synchronization passes;
* README synchronization passes;
* EPIC summary synchronization passes;
* changelog synchronization passes;
* revision-history synchronization passes;
* state consistency passes;
* reference integrity passes;
* placeholder validation passes;
* join-defect validation passes;
* security principles remain coherent;
* security architecture remains coherent;
* identity/authentication/authorization semantics remain coherent;
* data/secrets/cryptography semantics remain coherent;
* threat/risk/trust semantics remain coherent;
* security controls and compliance remain coherent;
* framework boundaries remain explicit;
* historical publication remains accurate;
* historical tag integrity is re-confirmed;
* Ruff passes;
* MyPy passes;
* Pytest passes;
* Git diff validation passes.

## 57. Final Machine-Readable State

After successful revalidation, expected `EPIC.yaml` state becomes:

```yaml
status: completed

baseline:
  framework_version: "5.0.0"
  documentation_status: completed
  repository_validation_status: validated
  final_validation_status: validated
```

Expected closure state:

```yaml
closure:
  documentation_complete: true
  control_documents_aligned: true
  validation_passed: true
  final_commit_created: true
  release_tag_created: true
  remote_publication_verified: true
  working_tree_clean: true
  epic_closed: true
```

Historical publication metadata SHALL remain unchanged.

## 58. Evidence Recording Rule

The required model is:

```text
Execute
    ↓
Observe
    ↓
Evaluate
    ↓
Record
```

The following model is prohibited:

```text
Requirement Exists
    ↓
Assume Success
    ↓
Record PASS
```

## 59. Current Validation Decision

Historical framework state:

```text
EPIC:                    EPIC-SEC-001
Framework Version:       5.0.0
Historical Publication:  Published
Historical Tag:          v5.0.0-security-framework
Historical Commit:       498fa16e692bf1461df2e4afba8bc4e485837a45
Historical Tag Policy:   Immutable
```

Current normalized repository state:

```text
Canonical Range:         00 → 09
Numbered Documents:      10
Control Documents:        7
Canonical Files:         17

Repository Validation:   Validated
Final Revalidation:      Validated
```

Therefore:

```text
EPIC-SEC-001 REVALIDATION: PASS
```

## 60. Final Validation Principle

Historical publication proves that EPIC-SEC-001 version `5.0.0` was released.

Current repository evidence determines whether the normalized seventeen-file representation is validated.

The historical release tag SHALL remain immutable while the current repository state earns its own validation result through evidence.
