## 1. Purpose

EPIC-FIN-001 records the completed implementation of the official FamilyOS Finance Plugin and establishes the governance record that was not present at the historical implementation release.

This EPIC does not rewrite the historical release. It documents and validates the already completed implementation represented by `v3.3.0-finance-plugin-implementation`.

## 2. Historical Baselines

The Finance Plugin documentation baseline is:

`v2.4.0-finance-plugin`

Commit: `f4957ffbbcbde034db7e98ffe540852af48d240b`

The Finance Plugin implementation baseline is:

`v3.3.0-finance-plugin-implementation`

Commit: `96e3ff906e629876e2be5790ca73c3096bab8fc5`

No EPIC-FIN-001 document existed at the implementation tag.

## 3. Source RFC

The implementation is governed by RFC-0012 — Finance Plugin.

The RFC documentation defines Finance architecture, domain, generation, policies, rules, and validation semantics.

## 4. Implementation Scope

The historical implementation contains the official Finance Plugin under:

`src/familyos_cli/plugins/builtin/finance`

The implementation includes:

- plugin descriptor and runtime entry point;
- account models and registry;
- asset models and registry;
- budget models and registry;
- finance capabilities;
- finance domain models and domain service;
- liability models and registry;
- policies, evaluator, and registry;
- profiles, registry, and resolver;
- documentation recipe;
- rules, evaluator, and registry;
- finance documentation template;
- transaction models and registry;
- validation models and validator.

## 5. Validation Scope

Repository evidence includes dedicated unit and runtime tests for:

- accounts;
- assets;
- budgets;
- capabilities;
- domain behavior;
- liabilities;
- policies;
- profiles;
- rules;
- transactions;
- validation;
- plugin runtime loading;
- runtime activation;
- capability runtime behavior;
- contribution runtime behavior.

## 6. Historical Integrity

EPIC-FIN-001 must preserve:

- the RFC release tag;
- the implementation release tag;
- their associated commits;
- the fact that no Finance implementation EPIC existed at the historical implementation release.

The retrospective EPIC must not move, replace, or reinterpret historical tags.

## 7. Governance Model

This directory contains seven control documents and no numbered documents.

The historical implementation remains authoritative evidence of implementation completion.

## 8. Completion

EPIC-FIN-001 is considered complete when:

- the seven control documents are present;
- historical baselines are verified;
- repository quality gates pass;
- control documents are aligned;
- remote publication is verified;
- the final repository state is clean;
- closure metadata records the completed state.
