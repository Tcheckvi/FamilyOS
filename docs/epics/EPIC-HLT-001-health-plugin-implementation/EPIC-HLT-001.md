## 1. Purpose

EPIC-HLT-001 records the completed implementation of the official FamilyOS Health Plugin and establishes the governance record that was not present at the historical implementation release.

This EPIC does not rewrite the historical release. It documents and validates the already completed implementation represented by `v3.2.0-health-plugin-implementation`.

## 2. Historical Baselines

The Health Plugin documentation baseline is:

`v2.3.0-health-plugin`
Commit: `0af94aada99946e1fd715c2964fae23b853757ca`

The Health Plugin implementation baseline is:

`v3.2.0-health-plugin-implementation`
Commit: `661f4176f6b14cbad4f888007ecc2afcc9648c75`

No EPIC-HLT-001 document existed at the implementation tag.

## 3. Source RFC

The implementation is governed by RFC-0011 — Health Plugin.

The RFC documentation defines the Health Plugin architecture, domain, generation, policies, rules, and validation model.

## 4. Implementation Scope

The historical implementation contains the official Health Plugin under:

`src/familyos_cli/plugins/builtin/health`

The implementation includes:

- plugin descriptor and runtime entry point;
- health capabilities;
- health domain models and domain service;
- metrics and metric registry;
- policies, policy evaluator, and policy registry;
- profiles and profile registry;
- records and record registry;
- rules, rule evaluator, and rule registry;
- validation models and validator;
- health documentation recipe.

## 5. Validation Scope

Repository evidence includes dedicated unit and runtime tests for:

- plugin loading;
- runtime activation;
- capabilities;
- contributions;
- metrics;
- policies;
- profiles;
- records;
- rules;
- validation.

The current repository quality gates used during retrospective revalidation are:

- Ruff;
- MyPy;
- Pytest;
- Git diff validation.

## 6. Historical Integrity

EPIC-HLT-001 must preserve:

- the RFC release tag;
- the implementation release tag;
- their associated commits;
- the fact that no Health implementation EPIC existed at the historical implementation release.

The retrospective EPIC must not move, replace, or reinterpret historical tags.

## 7. Governance Model

This directory contains seven control documents and no numbered documents.

The historical implementation itself remains authoritative evidence of implementation completion.

## 8. Completion

EPIC-HLT-001 is considered complete when:

- the seven control documents are present;
- historical baselines are verified;
- repository quality gates pass;
- control documents are aligned;
- remote publication is verified;
- the final repository state is clean;
- closure metadata records the completed state.
