# Quality Framework

## 10 Quality Risk Management

### Overview

The FamilyOS Quality Risk Management model defines how quality-related risks are identified, classified, evaluated, prioritized, mitigated, accepted, monitored, and governed.

Quality risk represents the possibility that a defect, weakness, gap, or quality condition may cause an undesirable engineering or operational outcome.

Examples include:

* functional failure;
* architectural degradation;
* security exposure;
* compatibility breakage;
* data corruption;
* unreliable releases;
* maintainability decline;
* operational instability;
* documentation failure;
* quality process failure.

The purpose of Quality Risk Management is to ensure that FamilyOS applies quality controls proportionally to potential impact rather than treating all components, findings, and changes identically.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of Quality Risk Management is to transform quality concerns into explicit engineering risk decisions.

Without a structured risk model, FamilyOS may fall into one of two extremes.

The first is under-protection.

```text id="ooyq1n"
Significant Risk
      ↓
Weak Verification
      ↓
Unexpected Failure
```

The second is over-protection.

```text id="hm20lz"
Low Risk
      ↓
Excessive Controls
      ↓
Unnecessary Engineering Friction
```

The target model is:

```text id="j0d1sk"
Engineering Context
      ↓
Risk Identification
      ↓
Risk Evaluation
      ↓
Risk-Based Controls
      ↓
Evidence
      ↓
Decision
```

---

## Risk Principle

The foundational principle is:

> Quality assurance depth must be proportional to engineering risk.

Higher-risk targets require:

* stronger verification;
* stronger evidence;
* stricter quality gates;
* tighter exception governance;
* faster remediation;
* greater review depth.

Lower-risk targets may use lighter controls where this does not compromise important platform properties.

---

## Quality Risk Definition

A Quality Risk is a potential negative outcome associated with an identified quality condition.

Conceptually:

```text id="3b3wtq"
Quality Risk
      =
Potential Event
      +
Likelihood
      +
Impact
      +
Affected Scope
      +
Context
```

A risk may exist even when no defect has yet occurred.

---

## Risk vs Finding

A finding and a risk are related but distinct.

A Quality Finding represents an observed concern.

A Quality Risk represents the potential consequence associated with that concern.

Example:

```text id="3tekiq"
Finding:
Critical dependency vulnerability

Risk:
Unauthorized access or compromise
```

One finding may create several risks.

One risk may also be supported by several findings.

---

## Risk Identity

Significant quality risks should have stable identifiers.

A conceptual format may be:

```text id="xg49an"
QLT-RISK-<DOMAIN>-<NUMBER>
```

Examples:

```text id="bp84p1"
QLT-RISK-SEC-001
QLT-RISK-ARC-004
QLT-RISK-REL-002
```

Stable identities support:

* tracking;
* ownership;
* mitigation;
* reporting;
* historical analysis;
* governance.

---

## Risk Metadata

A Quality Risk record may contain:

```text id="lzhsx5"
id
title
description
domain
source
target
likelihood
impact
severity
criticality
status
owner
created_at
reviewed_at
mitigation
residual_risk
related_findings
related_requirements
related_exceptions
```

The exact implementation structure may evolve.

---

## Risk Sources

Quality risks may originate from many sources.

Examples include:

```text id="qqm89j"
Quality Findings
Architecture Changes
Dependency Changes
Security Analysis
Testing Gaps
Operational Incidents
Documentation Gaps
Compatibility Changes
Manual Reviews
Quality Metrics
Historical Trends
```

Risk identification should not depend on findings alone.

---

## Risk Domains

Risks may be classified according to the Quality Domains.

Examples include:

```text id="xsgc08"
Correctness Risk
Architecture Risk
Security Risk
Reliability Risk
Performance Risk
Compatibility Risk
Dependency Risk
Documentation Risk
Build Risk
Release Risk
Governance Risk
```

A risk should have one primary domain and may reference related domains.

---

## Risk Context

Risk exists in context.

The same finding may represent different risk depending on the target.

For example:

```text id="t4h4pj"
Missing Test
```

in a non-critical utility may represent moderate risk.

The same missing test in authentication or persistence code may represent high risk.

Risk evaluation must therefore consider:

* target;
* criticality;
* exposure;
* lifecycle stage;
* affected users;
* data sensitivity;
* change scope.

---

## Risk Likelihood

Likelihood represents the probability that the potential negative outcome may occur.

A baseline classification may include:

```text id="1fwofd"
RARE
UNLIKELY
POSSIBLE
LIKELY
ALMOST_CERTAIN
```

Likelihood should be based on available evidence rather than arbitrary perception.

---

## Likelihood Factors

Likelihood may consider:

* defect history;
* code complexity;
* test coverage;
* change frequency;
* architecture coupling;
* dependency stability;
* operational exposure;
* known vulnerabilities;
* failure history.

For example:

```text id="7vh68g"
High Change Frequency
      +
Low Test Coverage
      +
Complex Integration
      ↓
Higher Failure Likelihood
```

---

## Risk Impact

Impact represents the consequence if the risk materializes.

A baseline classification may include:

```text id="m7nj3i"
NEGLIGIBLE
MINOR
MODERATE
MAJOR
CRITICAL
```

Impact should consider the worst credible consequence rather than only the most convenient scenario.

---

## Impact Dimensions

Impact may include:

```text id="mvmhzr"
User Impact
Data Impact
Security Impact
Operational Impact
Architecture Impact
Compatibility Impact
Engineering Cost
Reputation Impact
Recovery Cost
```

The relevant dimensions depend on the context.

---

## User Impact

User impact evaluates consequences for users.

Examples include:

* incorrect behavior;
* unavailable functionality;
* lost data;
* broken workflows;
* poor performance.

---

## Data Impact

Data impact considers:

* corruption;
* loss;
* inconsistency;
* unauthorized disclosure;
* irreversible transformation.

Persistent data failures often require stronger risk treatment because recovery may be difficult.

---

## Security Impact

Security impact may include:

* unauthorized access;
* privilege escalation;
* data exposure;
* integrity compromise;
* secret disclosure.

Security impact may elevate otherwise ordinary findings into high-risk issues.

---

## Operational Impact

Operational impact may include:

* service failure;
* inability to deploy;
* prolonged recovery;
* increased incident load;
* system instability.

---

## Architecture Impact

Architecture impact considers long-term consequences such as:

* structural erosion;
* increased coupling;
* extensibility loss;
* domain leakage;
* reduced maintainability.

Architecture risks may not immediately cause runtime failure but can create substantial future cost.

---

## Compatibility Impact

Compatibility impact evaluates consequences for existing consumers.

Potential outcomes include:

* API breakage;
* plugin incompatibility;
* migration failure;
* configuration breakage;
* data format incompatibility.

---

## Risk Severity

Risk severity combines likelihood and impact.

Conceptually:

```text id="h9x4l3"
Risk Severity
      =
Likelihood
      ×
Impact
```

The exact implementation may use a matrix rather than literal multiplication.

---

## Risk Matrix

A baseline conceptual matrix may be:

```text id="d8tw4s"
                 IMPACT
LIKELIHOOD      Minor   Moderate   Major   Critical

Rare            Low     Low        Medium  High
Unlikely        Low     Medium     Medium  High
Possible        Medium  Medium     High    Critical
Likely          Medium  High       High    Critical
Almost Certain  High    High       Critical Critical
```

The exact matrix should be calibrated through governance.

---

## Risk Levels

The FamilyOS Quality Framework may normalize risk into:

```text id="32iehe"
LOW
MEDIUM
HIGH
CRITICAL
```

Risk level should influence:

* remediation priority;
* gate behavior;
* review depth;
* exception policy;
* monitoring frequency.

---

## Risk vs Finding Severity

Finding severity and risk level are distinct.

Example:

```text id="5s0mse"
Finding Severity:
MEDIUM

Target:
Critical persistence component

Risk:
HIGH
```

The Quality Framework must preserve both values.

---

## Target Criticality

Risk evaluation must consider target criticality.

A target criticality model may include:

```text id="j4bfo5"
LOW
STANDARD
HIGH
CRITICAL
```

Criticality represents the importance of the component independent of a specific finding.

---

## Criticality Factors

Criticality may depend on:

* platform centrality;
* security function;
* data persistence;
* number of dependent components;
* public exposure;
* operational importance;
* recovery difficulty.

---

## Core Component Criticality

Core platform components often require higher assurance because failures may propagate widely.

Examples include:

* plugin runtime;
* identity;
* configuration;
* persistence foundations;
* shared contracts.

---

## Plugin Criticality

Official plugins may have different criticality depending on their responsibilities.

For example:

```text id="h2nog6"
Security Plugin
      → High / Critical

Documentation Utility Plugin
      → Standard
```

Criticality must be defined through explicit profile or metadata rather than assumed informally.

---

## Change Risk

Quality risk may also originate from change itself.

A change may be classified according to:

* size;
* scope;
* architecture impact;
* public API impact;
* dependency changes;
* migration requirements;
* security sensitivity.

Large or cross-cutting changes generally require stronger assurance.

---

## Change Risk Classification

A conceptual classification may include:

```text id="u1n3lm"
LOW
STANDARD
HIGH
CRITICAL
```

Examples:

```text id="1g7yvf"
Comment Update
      → Low

Internal Refactor
      → Standard

Public Contract Change
      → High

Authentication Architecture Change
      → Critical
```

---

## Risk-Based Quality Profiles

Risk classification should influence Quality Profile selection.

Conceptually:

```text id="frw24c"
Target Risk
      ↓
Profile Resolution
      ↓
Assurance Depth
```

Example:

```text id="1fuys5"
Standard Plugin
      ↓
Official Plugin Profile

Critical Security Plugin
      ↓
Official Plugin Profile
      +
Critical Component Profile
      +
Security-Sensitive Profile
```

---

## Risk-Based Rule Selection

Higher-risk contexts may activate additional rules.

Examples include:

```text id="s62txc"
Standard
      ↓
Unit Tests
Static Analysis

High Risk
      ↓
Unit Tests
Integration Tests
Contract Tests
Security Validation
Architecture Review
```

Risk-based rule activation must remain explicit.

---

## Risk-Based Thresholds

Quality thresholds may be stronger for higher-risk targets.

Example:

```text id="4i58tl"
Standard Component
Minimum Coverage = 80%

Critical Component
Minimum Coverage = 90%
```

Threshold changes must reflect real assurance needs rather than arbitrary strictness.

---

## Risk-Based Gate Behavior

Risk may affect which findings block progression.

Example:

```text id="9z3x8j"
MEDIUM Finding
      ↓
Standard Profile
      → Warning

MEDIUM Finding
      ↓
Critical Component Profile
      → Blocking
```

The original finding severity remains unchanged.

---

## Risk-Based Evidence Requirements

Higher-risk targets may require more evidence.

For example:

```text id="kc5y7o"
Standard Component
      ↓
Unit Test Evidence
Static Analysis Evidence

Critical Component
      ↓
Unit Test Evidence
Integration Evidence
Architecture Evidence
Security Evidence
Compatibility Evidence
Manual Review Evidence
```

---

## Risk Identification

Risk identification should occur throughout the lifecycle.

Potential stages include:

```text id="khr0el"
Architecture
Design
Implementation
Review
Testing
Build
Release
Operation
Incident Analysis
```

Risk management must not begin only when defects are found.

---

## Architecture Risk Identification

Architecture design may reveal risks such as:

* tight coupling;
* unclear ownership;
* excessive centralization;
* unsafe dependency direction;
* weak isolation.

These risks should be documented before implementation when practical.

---

## Implementation Risk Identification

Implementation may introduce risks through:

* complexity;
* untested branches;
* unsafe shortcuts;
* dependency changes;
* error-handling gaps.

Quality checks and review provide risk signals.

---

## Release Risk Identification

Release risk may include:

* unresolved findings;
* stale evidence;
* insufficient compatibility testing;
* risky migrations;
* incomplete documentation;
* unapproved exceptions.

Release readiness assessment must consider the combined risk state.

---

## Operational Risk Identification

Operational systems may reveal risks through:

* incidents;
* increased error rate;
* latency trends;
* repeated failures;
* capacity constraints.

Operational evidence must feed quality risk management.

---

## Risk Register

The framework may maintain a Quality Risk Register.

A Risk Register provides centralized visibility into significant risks.

Conceptually:

```text id="d85cgg"
Quality Risk Register
      ├── Open Risks
      ├── Mitigated Risks
      ├── Accepted Risks
      └── Closed Risks
```

The register should focus on meaningful risks rather than every minor finding.

---

## Risk Register Entry

A risk register entry may contain:

```text id="lrvsp7"
Risk ID
Title
Domain
Target
Likelihood
Impact
Risk Level
Owner
Status
Mitigation
Review Date
Related Findings
```

---

## Risk Ownership

Every significant open risk must have an owner.

Risk ownership includes responsibility for:

* monitoring;
* mitigation;
* review;
* escalation;
* closure recommendation.

Unowned high-risk issues are incompatible with effective governance.

---

## Risk Status

A baseline lifecycle may include:

```text id="4mwke2"
IDENTIFIED
      ↓
ASSESSED
      ↓
MITIGATION_PLANNED
      ↓
MITIGATING
      ↓
MITIGATED
      ↓
CLOSED
```

Alternative paths may include:

```text id="837a8i"
ACCEPTED
TRANSFERRED
DEFERRED
```

These states must have defined semantics.

---

## Risk Acceptance

Not every risk can or should be eliminated immediately.

Risk may be accepted when:

* mitigation cost exceeds justified benefit;
* exposure is limited;
* temporary acceptance enables necessary progress;
* compensating controls exist.

Risk acceptance must be explicit and governed.

---

## Risk Acceptance Record

An accepted risk should record:

```text id="j2ctpg"
risk
reason
owner
approver
scope
duration
mitigation
review_date
```

High and Critical risks should require stronger approval.

---

## Accepted Risk vs Exception

Risk acceptance and quality exceptions are related but different.

```text id="nyf5kr"
Exception
      ↓
Allows deviation from a defined quality requirement

Risk Acceptance
      ↓
Accepts the potential consequences associated with a risk
```

An exception may require an associated risk acceptance.

---

## Risk Mitigation

Mitigation reduces likelihood, impact, or both.

Mitigation strategies may include:

* defect correction;
* additional testing;
* architecture refactoring;
* stronger validation;
* dependency upgrade;
* isolation;
* feature limitation;
* monitoring;
* rollback capability;
* documentation.

---

## Preventive Mitigation

Preventive controls reduce likelihood.

Examples:

```text id="rxydxb"
Static Analysis
Type Checking
Architecture Constraints
Input Validation
Test Automation
```

---

## Detective Mitigation

Detective controls identify failures early.

Examples:

```text id="olthhf"
Integration Tests
Monitoring
Security Scanning
Runtime Alerts
```

---

## Containment Mitigation

Containment reduces impact after failure.

Examples:

* isolation;
* feature flags;
* bounded retries;
* transaction boundaries;
* circuit breakers;
* rollback.

---

## Recovery Mitigation

Recovery controls improve response after failure.

Examples include:

* backups;
* rollback plans;
* migration recovery;
* incident procedures;
* state reconstruction.

---

## Compensating Controls

When the preferred control is unavailable, an alternative control may reduce risk.

Example:

```text id="jg1pxk"
Missing Automated Check
      ↓
Temporary Manual Review
      ↓
Compensating Control
```

Compensating controls should usually be temporary and traceable.

---

## Risk Reduction

Mitigation should reduce the assessed risk.

The process may be:

```text id="5zsodu"
Initial Risk
      ↓
Mitigation
      ↓
Residual Risk
```

Residual risk must be evaluated explicitly.

---

## Residual Risk

Residual risk is the risk remaining after mitigation.

Example:

```text id="ovw2au"
Initial Risk:
CRITICAL

Mitigation:
Architecture isolation
Additional testing
Runtime monitoring

Residual Risk:
MEDIUM
```

Residual risk may still require acceptance.

---

## Risk Closure

A risk may be closed when:

* the condition no longer exists;
* mitigation reduces risk below an accepted threshold;
* the affected target is retired;
* evidence demonstrates elimination.

Closure must be supported by evidence.

---

## Risk Review

Open risks should be reviewed periodically.

Review frequency should reflect severity.

Example:

```text id="91h3wx"
LOW
      → periodic

MEDIUM
      → regular

HIGH
      → frequent

CRITICAL
      → immediate and continuous attention
```

Exact schedules may be defined by governance.

---

## Risk Aging

Long-lived risks may indicate quality debt.

Risk age can be measured as:

```text id="cxc01w"
Risk Age
=
Current Date
-
Risk Creation Date
```

High-risk items should not remain unresolved indefinitely without explicit acceptance.

---

## Risk Escalation

Risk may increase over time.

Escalation triggers may include:

* increased exposure;
* repeated incidents;
* worsening metrics;
* missed mitigation deadlines;
* new vulnerabilities;
* broader affected scope.

The risk record should be reassessed when context changes.

---

## Risk De-Escalation

Risk may decrease after:

* mitigation;
* reduced exposure;
* improved testing;
* architecture changes;
* dependency updates;
* successful operational evidence.

De-escalation must also be evidence-based.

---

## Risk Trends

Risk trends provide insight beyond individual records.

Examples:

```text id="glxaoq"
High Risks
Release 1 → 7
Release 2 → 5
Release 3 → 2
```

or:

```text id="5aviy5"
Architecture Risks
      ↓
Increasing
```

Trend analysis can guide investment.

---

## Risk Metrics

Possible risk metrics include:

```text id="aeenz5"
Open Risk Count
Critical Risk Count
High Risk Count
Average Risk Age
Mitigation Completion Rate
Accepted Risk Count
Expired Risk Acceptance Count
```

These metrics should support governance.

---

## Risk Heat Map

The framework may eventually provide a risk heat map.

Example dimensions:

```text id="f8x9of"
Likelihood
      ×
Impact
```

Heat maps are useful for visualization but must preserve individual risk details.

---

## Risk Aggregation

Risk may be aggregated by:

* domain;
* plugin;
* repository;
* release;
* profile;
* owner.

Aggregation should not hide critical individual risks.

For example:

```text id="sthu1s"
Average Risk = Medium
```

must not obscure:

```text id="9721jt"
One Critical Security Risk
```

---

## Release Risk

A release should have an explicit risk state.

Release risk may be influenced by:

```text id="j22l1f"
Blocking Findings
Open High Risks
Critical Risks
Approved Exceptions
Evidence Gaps
Compatibility Concerns
Operational Readiness
```

A release quality gate should consider these factors.

---

## Release Risk Classification

A release may be classified conceptually as:

```text id="lyls01"
LOW
STANDARD
ELEVATED
HIGH
UNACCEPTABLE
```

The exact model may be defined later.

Release risk must not be reduced to a single arbitrary score if critical conditions exist.

---

## Quality Gate Risk Policy

Quality Gates should define acceptable risk.

For example:

```text id="f323ue"
Release Gate

Critical Risk:
Not allowed

High Risk:
Requires explicit approval

Medium Risk:
Allowed with ownership

Low Risk:
Allowed
```

Gate risk policy must be explicit.

---

## Risk and Quality Findings

A finding may create a new risk automatically when:

* severity exceeds a threshold;
* the target is critical;
* the issue affects multiple domains;
* the finding remains unresolved.

Not every minor finding requires a separate risk record.

---

## Finding-to-Risk Promotion

A conceptual promotion process may be:

```text id="z3zy0z"
Finding
      ↓
Risk Evaluation
      ↓
Significant?
      ├── No → Finding Lifecycle
      └── Yes → Risk Register
```

This avoids flooding the risk register.

---

## Risk and Metrics

Metrics may indicate emerging risk before individual findings exist.

Examples:

```text id="41grma"
Coverage steadily decreasing
      ↓
Regression Risk Increasing
```

or:

```text id="1jvmpq"
Build duration rapidly increasing
      ↓
Developer Workflow Risk
```

Trend-based risks should remain evidence-driven.

---

## Risk and Technical Debt

Technical debt often represents deferred risk.

Examples include:

* architecture violations;
* obsolete dependencies;
* insufficient tests;
* undocumented behavior.

Debt should be prioritized according to risk rather than age alone.

---

## Risk and Quality Debt

Quality debt may be categorized by risk.

Example:

```text id="4y1hl0"
Debt Item A
      → LOW

Debt Item B
      → HIGH

Debt Item C
      → CRITICAL
```

This supports rational remediation order.

---

## Risk and Documentation

Documentation gaps can create real quality risk.

Examples include:

* incorrect operating procedures;
* missing migration guidance;
* undocumented public API changes;
* incomplete architecture information.

Documentation risk should not automatically be considered low.

---

## Risk and Security

Security risks require special attention because:

* exploitation may be adversarial;
* impact may be severe;
* likelihood may change rapidly;
* external vulnerability information evolves.

Security risk assessments should be updated when relevant information changes.

---

## Risk and Compatibility

Compatibility risks may remain hidden until external consumers upgrade.

Therefore, public interface changes should receive explicit compatibility risk analysis.

Potential mitigation includes:

* deprecation periods;
* migration guidance;
* compatibility testing;
* versioning.

---

## Risk and Architecture

Architecture risks often accumulate slowly.

Examples include:

* growing coupling;
* repeated boundary violations;
* central components becoming overloaded;
* hidden cross-domain dependencies.

Architecture risk management should consider long-term platform sustainability.

---

## Risk and Reliability

Reliability risk may be informed by:

* incident history;
* recovery failures;
* flaky behavior;
* error trends;
* insufficient resilience testing.

Production evidence is particularly valuable.

---

## Risk and Performance

Performance risk is contextual.

Examples include:

* CLI latency affecting developer productivity;
* slow tests delaying feedback;
* runtime resource exhaustion;
* degraded scalability.

Performance risk should be evaluated against intended usage.

---

## Risk and Build

Build risk may include:

* non-reproducible artifacts;
* dependency resolution instability;
* environment dependence;
* packaging failures.

Build failures can compromise release reliability even when application tests pass.

---

## Risk and Infrastructure

Infrastructure risk may affect the quality system itself.

Examples:

* unstable CI;
* unreliable evidence generation;
* environment drift;
* secret management issues.

Quality infrastructure must therefore participate in risk management.

---

## Risk and Governance

Governance failures can create systemic risk.

Examples include:

```text id="azc4by"
Expired Exceptions
Unowned Critical Findings
Unreviewed Risk Acceptances
Unauthorized Rule Changes
```

These risks may undermine the complete quality system.

---

## Risk Discovery from Incidents

Incidents should trigger risk analysis.

A mature loop is:

```text id="6vy4xf"
Incident
   ↓
Root Cause
   ↓
Risk Identification
   ↓
Quality Control Improvement
   ↓
Verification
```

The objective is to prevent recurrence.

---

## Risk Discovery from Trends

Quality metrics may reveal systemic risks.

Example:

```text id="30lq9s"
Architecture Violations
      ↓
Increasing for four releases
      ↓
Architecture Sustainability Risk
```

This demonstrates why metrics and risk management must be connected.

---

## Risk Discovery from Reviews

Human review may identify risks not detectable automatically.

Examples include:

* unclear architecture;
* unsafe product assumptions;
* poor domain boundaries;
* insufficient migration strategy.

These should be recorded when materially significant.

---

## Risk Assessment Evidence

Every significant risk assessment should identify supporting evidence.

Example:

```text id="ndroqp"
Risk:
High probability of compatibility regression

Evidence:
Contract test failures
API diff
Recent consumer breakage
```

This makes the assessment explainable.

---

## Risk Confidence

Risk estimates involve uncertainty.

The framework may eventually record confidence such as:

```text id="zztlu7"
LOW_CONFIDENCE
MEDIUM_CONFIDENCE
HIGH_CONFIDENCE
```

This should only be introduced if it improves decisions.

Uncertainty must not be hidden.

---

## Risk Uncertainty

When insufficient evidence exists, the framework should explicitly represent uncertainty.

Example:

```text id="yiu9hv"
Likelihood:
UNKNOWN
```

should not automatically be treated as low risk.

Missing information may itself require additional verification.

---

## Conservative Risk Handling

For critical contexts, uncertainty should favor additional assurance rather than optimistic assumptions.

Conceptually:

```text id="fspipe"
High Impact
      +
Unknown Likelihood
      ↓
Additional Verification Required
```

---

## Risk Review Gates

High-risk changes may require explicit review gates.

For example:

```text id="nvxoje"
Critical Architecture Change
      ↓
Architecture Risk Review
      ↓
Implementation
```

This moves risk management earlier in the lifecycle.

---

## Risk-Based Testing

Testing depth should reflect risk.

Examples:

```text id="9r4kkx"
Low Risk
      ↓
Focused Unit Tests

High Risk
      ↓
Unit
Integration
Contract
Regression
Failure Path
```

Testing strategy remains defined by the Testing Framework.

The Quality Framework determines assurance expectations.

---

## Risk-Based Review

Review requirements may increase with risk.

High-risk changes may require:

* architecture review;
* security review;
* domain review;
* release review.

Low-risk changes may use normal peer review.

---

## Risk-Based Automation

Repeated high-risk failure patterns should be candidates for automation.

Example:

```text id="k6x0o7"
Repeated Architecture Violation
      ↓
Automated Architecture Rule
```

This transforms learned risk into preventive quality control.

---

## Risk Mitigation Prioritization

Mitigation should prioritize:

```text id="ufz7ph"
Critical
      ↓
High
      ↓
Medium
      ↓
Low
```

However, remediation cost and dependency sequencing may affect execution order.

Prioritization decisions must remain explicit.

---

## Risk Remediation SLA

The framework may eventually define target remediation windows based on risk level.

For example:

```text id="7chjzx"
Critical
      → immediate

High
      → urgent

Medium
      → planned

Low
      → backlog
```

Exact durations should be governed separately rather than embedded as arbitrary universal values.

---

## Risk Exceptions

A rule exception may create or modify risk.

Example:

```text id="2z8g25"
Rule Failure
      ↓
Approved Exception
      ↓
Residual Risk
      ↓
Risk Acceptance
```

Exceptions must not erase the underlying risk.

---

## Exception Expiration

When an exception expires:

```text id="mhj64b"
Exception
      ↓
No Longer Valid
      ↓
Risk Reassessment
```

The associated risk may become blocking again.

---

## Risk Escalation on Expired Exceptions

Expired exceptions associated with high-risk findings should trigger visible escalation.

They must not silently continue.

---

## Risk Acceptance Expiration

Accepted risk should be periodically reviewed.

Time-bounded acceptance prevents temporary decisions from becoming permanent by neglect.

---

## Risk Treatment Options

The framework may recognize standard risk treatment strategies:

```text id="bc8o9q"
AVOID
MITIGATE
ACCEPT
TRANSFER
MONITOR
```

---

## Avoid

Avoidance removes the risk source.

Example:

```text id="zcnj7m"
Unsafe Dependency
      ↓
Remove Dependency
```

---

## Mitigate

Mitigation reduces likelihood or impact.

Example:

```text id="nh9jxd"
Risky Integration
      ↓
Isolation + Tests + Monitoring
```

---

## Accept

Acceptance acknowledges residual risk and allows continued operation.

Acceptance requires governance proportional to risk.

---

## Transfer

Transfer shifts part of the risk to another controlled mechanism or provider.

This is less common in internal engineering risk but may apply to external infrastructure or managed services.

Transfer does not eliminate accountability.

---

## Monitor

Some risks require observation rather than immediate intervention.

Monitoring is appropriate when:

* risk is low;
* evidence is incomplete;
* trend development matters.

Monitoring must define what would trigger escalation.

---

## Risk Trigger

A monitored risk should define triggers.

Examples:

```text id="kzvsmk"
Error Rate > threshold
Finding Count > threshold
Dependency reaches end-of-support
Coverage falls below threshold
```

Triggers convert monitoring into actionable governance.

---

## Risk Review Board

The framework may eventually define a Quality Risk Review function for significant risks.

Its responsibilities may include:

* reviewing High and Critical risks;
* approving risk acceptance;
* evaluating mitigation;
* resolving cross-domain ownership;
* reviewing recurring risks.

The exact organizational form may vary.

---

## Risk Governance

Risk management must itself be governed.

Governance should define:

* classification criteria;
* ownership;
* review responsibilities;
* acceptance authority;
* escalation;
* lifecycle;
* reporting.

Without governance, risk ratings may become inconsistent.

---

## Risk Authority

Different risk levels may require different approval authority.

For example:

```text id="66v37m"
LOW
      → owner

MEDIUM
      → domain authority

HIGH
      → quality / architecture authority

CRITICAL
      → senior governance approval
```

Exact roles must be defined by FamilyOS governance structures.

---

## Risk Auditability

A risk decision should be reconstructable.

An audit should determine:

```text id="j1n9c2"
What risk existed?

How was it assessed?

Which evidence supported it?

Which mitigation was selected?

Who accepted residual risk?

When was it reviewed?
```

---

## Risk Reporting

Quality reports should expose meaningful risks.

Example:

```text id="htjisa"
Open Risks

Critical: 0
High: 2
Medium: 7
Low: 14
```

High-level summaries must allow drill-down to individual risks.

---

## Release Risk Report

A release risk report may contain:

```text id="uw6if3"
Release
Risk Summary
Open Critical Risks
Open High Risks
Accepted Risks
Exceptions
Mitigations
Residual Risk
Recommendation
```

This supports release governance.

---

## Domain Risk Reporting

Reports may group risks by domain.

Example:

```text id="pwd6j1"
Security        HIGH
Architecture    MEDIUM
Testing         LOW
Documentation   LOW
```

This helps identify risk concentration.

---

## Risk Dashboards

Future dashboards may show:

* heat maps;
* risk trends;
* aging;
* ownership;
* mitigation progress;
* risk by release;
* risk by domain.

Dashboards remain reporting mechanisms, not risk authorities.

---

## Risk Metrics and Trends

The framework should monitor:

```text id="65pc8q"
Risk Creation Rate
Risk Closure Rate
Critical Risk Count
High Risk Age
Accepted Risk Trend
Mitigation Completion
```

These metrics indicate quality management effectiveness.

---

## Systemic Risk

Some risks affect multiple components simultaneously.

Examples include:

* shared dependency vulnerability;
* broken build infrastructure;
* core architecture flaw;
* invalid quality rule;
* widespread test instability.

These should be classified as systemic risks.

---

## Systemic Risk Scope

A systemic risk may affect:

```text id="wjk09a"
Multiple Plugins
Entire Repository
Release Pipeline
Engineering Platform
```

Systemic risks usually require higher governance attention.

---

## Cascading Risk

One failure may create additional risks.

Example:

```text id="22kpfs"
CI Instability
      ↓
Missing Reliable Evidence
      ↓
Release Confidence Risk
```

The risk model should support relationships between risks.

---

## Risk Relationships

Risks may be linked as:

```text id="fbswk9"
CAUSES
INCREASES
DEPENDS_ON
MITIGATES
DUPLICATES
```

Relationships may support more advanced risk analysis later.

---

## Risk Graph

A future risk graph may connect:

```text id="m7pxj6"
Finding
      ↓
Risk
      ↓
Mitigation
      ↓
Residual Risk
      ↓
Gate Decision
```

and cross-links between dependent risks.

---

## Risk Scoring

The framework may use numeric scores internally if useful.

However, numeric scores must remain explainable.

Example:

```text id="6ic2pz"
Likelihood = 4
Impact = 5
Score = 20
```

The resulting risk classification must preserve meaning.

---

## No Blind Numeric Risk

Risk must not be reduced to unexplained numbers such as:

```text id="2b1uwo"
Risk Score = 7.4
```

without clear semantics.

Categorical classifications are often more understandable.

---

## Risk Model Calibration

The risk model should be calibrated through real engineering experience.

Calibration may consider:

* defect history;
* incident severity;
* mitigation effectiveness;
* false escalations;
* release outcomes.

The model should evolve if classifications consistently fail to reflect real consequences.

---

## Risk Model Consistency

Equivalent situations should receive similar risk evaluations.

Consistency requires:

* documented criteria;
* examples;
* domain guidance;
* periodic review.

Risk management must avoid arbitrary personal interpretation.

---

## Risk Examples

### Example — Architecture

```text id="m4r5h8"
Finding:
Core module directly depends on plugin implementation.

Likelihood:
Likely

Impact:
Major

Risk:
HIGH

Mitigation:
Restore architecture boundary and add automated dependency validation.
```

---

## Example — Security

```text id="7j7vut"
Finding:
Critical vulnerability in authentication dependency.

Likelihood:
Possible

Impact:
Critical

Risk:
CRITICAL

Treatment:
Upgrade dependency immediately or block release.
```

---

## Example — Documentation

```text id="e1eq59"
Finding:
Migration instructions missing for internal development-only change.

Likelihood:
Possible

Impact:
Minor

Risk:
LOW
```

The same documentation gap for a breaking public migration could be High risk.

---

## Example — Testing

```text id="mtxs84"
Finding:
No integration tests for payment-like financial transaction workflow.

Target Criticality:
High

Likelihood:
Possible

Impact:
Major

Risk:
HIGH
```

The testing gap is evaluated in context rather than through coverage alone.

---

## Example — Build

```text id="m3vt40"
Finding:
Release build is non-reproducible.

Likelihood:
Likely

Impact:
Major

Risk:
HIGH

Gate:
Release blocked until mitigation or approved acceptance.
```

---

## Risk Automation

Risk identification and classification may be partially automated.

Automation can derive candidate risk from:

* finding severity;
* target criticality;
* profile;
* domain;
* historical trends.

However, high-impact risk decisions may still require human judgment.

---

## Automated Risk Suggestions

A Quality Assessment Engine may suggest:

```text id="g77wrb"
Suggested Risk:
HIGH

Reason:
HIGH severity finding
+
CRITICAL target
+
Public API impact
```

The final risk classification may remain reviewable.

---

## AI-Assisted Risk Analysis

AI may assist with:

* summarizing risk context;
* identifying correlated findings;
* proposing mitigation;
* analyzing historical patterns;
* highlighting potential systemic risk.

AI should not autonomously accept critical risk or override authoritative quality policy.

---

## Risk Explainability

Every significant risk should be explainable.

An engineer should understand:

```text id="n1yc4n"
What can go wrong?

Why is it likely or unlikely?

What would the impact be?

Which evidence supports the assessment?

What mitigation exists?

What residual risk remains?
```

---

## Risk Decision Trace

A decision trace may look like:

```text id="f8xa90"
Finding
      ↓
Risk Assessment
      ↓
HIGH Risk
      ↓
Mitigation Required
      ↓
Residual MEDIUM Risk
      ↓
Approved Acceptance
      ↓
Release Gate PASS
```

This preserves governance context.

---

## Risk Data Integrity

Risk records may influence release decisions.

They must therefore be protected against:

* unauthorized edits;
* silent severity changes;
* deleted mitigation obligations;
* modified acceptance records.

Risk data must remain traceable.

---

## Risk Retention

Significant historical risks may provide valuable engineering knowledge.

Retention may support:

* incident analysis;
* release history;
* rule improvement;
* recurring risk analysis;
* governance audits.

Closed risks should not always be immediately deleted.

---

## Risk Knowledge Base

Recurring risks may eventually form a knowledge base.

Example:

```text id="f0x5aw"
Risk Pattern:
Cross-plugin internal dependency

Typical Impact:
Architecture erosion

Preferred Mitigation:
Public capability contract + automated rule
```

This helps convert historical experience into preventive quality engineering.

---

## Risk and Continuous Improvement

Risk management should improve the Quality Framework.

The cycle is:

```text id="1ao1ki"
Risk
  ↓
Mitigation
  ↓
Learning
  ↓
New Rule / Better Architecture / Better Test
  ↓
Reduced Future Risk
```

This turns individual problems into systemic improvement.

---

## Risk Anti-Patterns

The Quality Risk Management model rejects several anti-patterns.

### Risk Equals Severity

Finding severity alone is not sufficient risk analysis.

### All Risks Are Critical

Over-classification destroys prioritization.

### Risk Without Owner

Significant risks require ownership.

### Permanent Acceptance

Accepted risk must remain reviewable.

### Risk Without Evidence

Important classifications must be supported by context and evidence.

### Risk Hidden by Exception

Exceptions do not eliminate underlying risk.

### Average Risk Hiding Critical Risk

Aggregation must preserve critical individual conditions.

### Risk Register as Backlog Dump

Only meaningful engineering risks should enter the formal register.

---

## Initial Implementation

An initial FamilyOS implementation may begin with:

```text id="21eehs"
Risk ID
Domain
Target
Likelihood
Impact
Risk Level
Owner
Status
Related Finding
Mitigation
```

This is sufficient to establish structured risk management.

---

## Initial Risk Workflow

A practical initial workflow may be:

```text id="63n9zf"
Quality Finding
      ↓
Risk Evaluation
      ↓
Significant Risk?
      ├── No → Normal Finding Management
      └── Yes
            ↓
         Risk Register
            ↓
         Mitigation
            ↓
         Residual Risk
            ↓
         Closure / Acceptance
```

---

## Risk Maturity Model

Quality Risk Management may mature progressively.

```text id="jjm75y"
Level 1
Informal Risk Awareness

    ↓

Level 2
Documented Risk Classification

    ↓

Level 3
Risk Register

    ↓

Level 4
Risk-Based Profiles and Gates

    ↓

Level 5
Trend and Metric Integration

    ↓

Level 6
Continuous Risk Observability

    ↓

Level 7
Predictive Quality Risk Management
```

---

## Predictive Risk Management

As historical quality data grows, FamilyOS may eventually predict elevated risk.

Potential signals include:

* rapidly changing modules;
* growing architecture violations;
* recurring defects;
* declining test stability;
* dependency vulnerability patterns.

Predictive output should remain advisory until sufficient evidence and governance exist.

---

## Reference Risk Flow

The complete Quality Risk Management flow can be represented as:

```text id="au072v"
Engineering Change / Finding / Metric / Incident
                    ↓
             Risk Identification
                    ↓
             Risk Assessment
                    ↓
        Likelihood + Impact + Context
                    ↓
             Risk Classification
                    ↓
        ┌───────────┼───────────┐
        ↓           ↓           ↓
      Avoid       Mitigate     Accept
        ↓           ↓           ↓
        └───────────┼───────────┘
                    ↓
               Residual Risk
                    ↓
              Quality Gate
                    ↓
             Engineering Decision
                    ↓
                 Monitor
                    ↓
          Continuous Improvement
```

---

## Strategic Outcome

Quality Risk Management enables FamilyOS to move from:

```text id="pt2b92"
This looks dangerous.
```

toward:

```text id="wiabsi"
This change creates a HIGH compatibility risk because
it modifies a public contract used by several official plugins.

The risk is mitigated through compatibility tests,
deprecation support, and migration documentation.

Residual risk is MEDIUM and has been explicitly accepted
for this release.
```

This creates a stronger and more disciplined engineering decision model.

---

## Final Risk Principle

Quality cannot be managed effectively without understanding risk.

The purpose of quality controls is not to eliminate every possible imperfection.

It is to protect FamilyOS against unacceptable engineering outcomes while enabling sustainable evolution.

The FamilyOS Quality Risk Management model therefore establishes a structured relationship between:

```text id="ptih7b"
Quality Condition
      ↓
Potential Consequence
      ↓
Risk
      ↓
Assurance
      ↓
Mitigation
      ↓
Decision
```

Through explicit identification, classification, evidence, ownership, mitigation, residual risk, acceptance, monitoring, and governance, Quality Risk Management provides the decision framework required to apply FamilyOS quality assurance proportionally, consistently, and responsibly across the complete engineering ecosystem.
