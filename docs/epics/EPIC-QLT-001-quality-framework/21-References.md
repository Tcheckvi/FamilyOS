# Quality Framework

## 21 References

### Overview

This document identifies the authoritative FamilyOS references that define, constrain, support, or complement the Quality Framework.

The Quality Framework does not operate in isolation.

It depends on architectural, engineering, testing, documentation, build, release, security, plugin, governance, and specification artifacts distributed across the FamilyOS ecosystem.

The purpose of this reference model is to make those relationships explicit.

The Quality Framework should be interpreted in the context of the broader FamilyOS engineering system.

Conceptually:

```text id="5rq1im"
FamilyOS Vision
      ↓
Engineering Foundation
      ↓
Architecture Foundation
      ↓
Specialized Engineering Frameworks
      ↓
Quality Framework
      ↓
Quality Verification and Governance
```

The references defined here provide the context required to understand how quality requirements originate and how the Quality Framework integrates with other FamilyOS capabilities.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to:

* identify normative dependencies;
* distinguish authoritative references from informational references;
* preserve traceability;
* avoid duplicated policy;
* support framework evolution;
* simplify audits and reviews;
* clarify cross-framework responsibilities.

A reference should exist because it contributes meaningful authority or context.

The Quality Framework should not accumulate references that provide no direct engineering value.

---

## Reference Principles

FamilyOS references should remain:

* explicit;
* stable;
* traceable;
* version-aware;
* categorized;
* maintained;
* non-duplicative.

The Quality Framework should reference authoritative sources instead of copying their complete semantics.

---

## Normative and Informative References

References are divided conceptually into two categories.

```text id="6a7nhy"
Normative References
      ↓
Define requirements or authoritative constraints

Informative References
      ↓
Provide explanation, context, or supporting guidance
```

This distinction is important.

Not every referenced document creates mandatory Quality Framework behavior.

---

## Normative Reference

A Normative Reference defines authoritative expectations that may influence:

```text id="3ak0rx"
Quality Requirements
Quality Rules
Quality Profiles
Compliance
Assessments
Quality Gates
Governance
```

When a normative reference conflicts with lower-level quality configuration, the authoritative governance hierarchy should determine precedence.

---

## Informative Reference

An Informative Reference helps explain or contextualize quality engineering but does not independently define mandatory compliance.

Examples may include:

* guidance;
* explanatory documentation;
* historical assessments;
* educational material.

---

## Reference Authority

Every significant reference should have an understood authority level.

A conceptual hierarchy is:

```text id="nnpvuy"
Engineering Constitution
      ↓
Approved Architecture Decisions
      ↓
Normative Frameworks
      ↓
Approved RFCs / Specifications
      ↓
Quality Policies
      ↓
Quality Rules / Profiles
      ↓
Tool Configuration
```

This hierarchy should remain aligned with FamilyOS Engineering and Documentation Governance.

---

## FamilyOS Engineering Constitution

The Engineering Constitution establishes the highest-level engineering principles governing FamilyOS.

The Quality Framework must remain consistent with those principles.

Relevant concerns include:

```text id="ngfzp3"
Architecture Before Implementation
Explicit Contracts
Deterministic Engineering
Security by Design
Testability
Documentation
Governance
Maintainability
```

The Quality Framework operationalizes many of these principles through evidence, assessment, and enforcement.

---

## Engineering Foundation

The Engineering Foundation defines the general engineering model used by FamilyOS.

Primary reference:

```text id="94o85v"
EPIC-ENG-001 — Engineering Foundation
```

Relevant documents may include:

```text id="6qn13k"
00-EPIC.md
01-Context.md

18-Roadmap.md
19-References.md
20-Validation.md
21-Summary.md
22-Release.md
23-Implementation-Checklist.md
```

The Quality Framework specializes the general quality principles defined by the Engineering Foundation.

---

## Architecture Foundation

The FamilyOS architecture foundation defines structural principles and system boundaries that quality mechanisms must preserve.

Relevant foundation documents include:

```text id="7cds97"
Architecture-Vision.md
Architecture-Map.md
Application-Architecture.md
Domain-Architecture.md
Plugin-Architecture.md
Runtime-Architecture.md
Configuration-Architecture.md
Data-Architecture.md
Infrastructure-Architecture.md
Integration-Architecture.md
API-Architecture.md
CLI-Architecture.md
Event-Architecture.md
Notification-Architecture.md
Observability-Architecture.md
Security-Architecture.md
Documentation-Architecture.md
Governance-Architecture.md
Workflow-Architecture.md
Deployment-Architecture.md
Generation-Architecture.md
Identity-Architecture.md
Presentation-Architecture.md
```

These documents provide architectural intent that may later become Quality Requirements and executable architecture rules.

---

## Architecture Decisions

Approved ADRs are important normative references.

Relevant decisions may include:

```text id="0eqr7x"
ADR-0007 — Official Plugins Architecture
ADR-0008
ADR-0009
ADR-0010
ADR-0011
ADR-0013
```

The exact scope of each ADR should be determined from its authoritative content.

The Quality Framework should not reinterpret an ADR beyond its approved semantics.

---

## Official Plugins Architecture

`ADR-0007 — Official Plugins Architecture` is particularly relevant.

It establishes architectural expectations for official FamilyOS plugins.

The Quality Framework may consume these expectations through:

```text id="4a2y5f"
Architecture Rules
Plugin Compliance
Quality Profiles
Plugin Gates
Release Assessments
```

The Plugin Compliance Framework remains the specialized enforcement layer for plugin-specific conformity.

---

## Testing Framework

Primary reference:

```text id="74tfpn"
EPIC-TST-001 — Testing Framework
```

The Testing Framework defines how FamilyOS testing is designed and governed.

Relevant capabilities include:

```text id="e8vj4o"
Testing Principles
Testing Architecture
Testing Levels
Unit Testing
Integration Testing
Functional Testing
System Testing
Contract Testing
Regression Testing
Test Data
Fixtures
Mocks
Test Execution
Performance
```

The Quality Framework must not redefine testing methodology.

Instead:

```text id="c0c61y"
Testing Framework
      ↓
Produces Testing Expectations and Evidence

Quality Framework
      ↓
Consumes Testing Evidence and Determines Quality Impact
```

---

## Testing and Quality Relationship

The Testing Framework answers questions such as:

```text id="i8srm1"
How should testing be structured?

Which test levels are required?

How should fixtures and mocks be managed?

How should test execution work?
```

The Quality Framework answers:

```text id="qtxszj"
Is required testing evidence available?

What quality state does testing produce?

Does testing state block progression?

Is testing quality degrading?
```

---

## Documentation Framework

Primary reference:

```text id="zcd9md"
EPIC-DOC-001 — Documentation Framework
```

Relevant documents include:

```text id="ku9gdr"
01-Introduction.md
02-Documentation-Vision.md
03-Documentation-Architecture.md
04-Documentation-Standards.md
05-Documentation-Lifecycle.md
06-Documentation-Templates.md
07-Documentation-Metadata.md

14-Documentation-Quality.md
15-Documentation-Governance.md
16-Documentation-Toolchain.md
17-Roadmap.md
18-References.md
```

The Documentation Framework is authoritative for documentation-specific quality requirements.

---

## Documentation and Quality Relationship

The Documentation Framework defines:

```text id="d8l6n4"
Documentation Standards
Structure
Metadata
Lifecycle
Versioning
Traceability
Validation
Publishing
```

The Quality Framework consumes documentation state through:

```text id="br7y5t"
Quality Evidence
Quality Findings
Documentation Assessment
Compliance
Quality Gates
```

---

## Build Framework

Primary reference:

```text id="ev8pqb"
EPIC-BLD-001 — Build Framework
```

The Build Framework defines how FamilyOS builds are produced, validated, and governed.

Quality integration may include:

```text id="lrly4d"
Build Success
Reproducibility
Artifact Validation
Dependency Resolution
Build Evidence
Build Quality Gates
```

The Build Framework remains authoritative for build semantics.

---

## Release Framework

Primary reference:

```text id="8qewcn"
EPIC-REL-001 — Release Framework
```

The Release Framework defines:

```text id="cxwvhp"
Release Lifecycle
Versioning
Changelog
Tags
Release Artifacts
Release Validation
Release Governance
```

The Quality Framework supplies quality state and evidence used by Release Gates.

---

## Release and Quality Relationship

The relationship is:

```text id="8nrk9z"
Release Candidate
      ↓
Quality Verification
      ↓
Quality Assessment
      ↓
Release Quality Gate
      ↓
Release Framework
      ↓
Official Release
```

Release Governance controls the lifecycle.

Quality Governance controls quality semantics.

---

## Plugin Compliance Framework

Primary reference:

```text id="c4wcs1"
EPIC-PLUGIN-002 — Plugin Compliance Framework
```

Relevant documents include:

```text id="sxhj2a"
00-EPIC.md
01-Context.md
02-Vision.md
03-Principles.md
04-Compliance-Architecture.md
05-Compliance-Domains.md
06-Compliance-Rule-Model.md
07-Compliance-Profiles.md
08-Validation-Engine.md
09-Evidence-Model.md

18-Roadmap.md
19-References.md
20-Validation.md
21-Summary.md
22-Release.md
23-Implementation-Checklist.md
```

---

## Plugin Compliance and Quality Relationship

The Plugin Compliance Framework specializes compliance for plugins.

It defines plugin-specific:

```text id="6070zs"
Compliance Domains
Rules
Profiles
Validation
Evidence
Findings
Reports
Gates
Governance
```

The Quality Framework provides common quality concepts such as:

```text id="fsx6fr"
Quality Evidence
Risk
Assessment
Quality Gates
Quality Debt
Observability
Continuous Improvement
```

The two frameworks should integrate without duplicating responsibilities.

---

## Security Architecture

Primary reference:

```text id="awjo8v"
Security-Architecture.md
```

Security quality requirements should originate from authoritative security architecture and policy.

The Quality Framework may consume:

```text id="mfxm4r"
Security Findings
Security Evidence
Security Risk
Security Assessments
Security Gate Conditions
```

It should not independently redefine security architecture.

---

## Security Plugin RFC

Relevant reference:

```text id="p2kd9x"
RFC-0010 — Security Plugin
```

Security plugin behavior and contracts may create plugin-specific quality and compliance expectations.

---

## Health Plugin RFC

Relevant reference:

```text id="wqymd6"
RFC-0011 — Health Plugin
```

Quality requirements may consume defined contracts and architecture without duplicating domain semantics.

---

## Finance Plugin RFC

Relevant reference:

```text id="8gxz11"
RFC-0012 — Finance Plugin
```

Finance-related capabilities may require elevated correctness, data integrity, and compatibility quality expectations.

---

## Education Plugin RFC

Relevant reference:

```text id="fyz4n9"
RFC-0013 — Education Plugin
```

---

## Documents Plugin RFC

Relevant reference:

```text id="mign7m"
RFC-0014 — Documents Plugin
```

Document-related behavior may integrate with the Documentation Framework and Quality Compliance.

---

## Communication Plugin RFC

Relevant reference:

```text id="3c9srq"
RFC-0015 — Communication Plugin
```

Communication capabilities may introduce quality concerns around:

* delivery reliability;
* archiving;
* scheduling;
* channel behavior;
* compatibility.

---

## Official Plugin RFC Sequence

The official plugin RFC sequence is:

```text id="4o5k3q"
RFC-0010 Security
      ↓
RFC-0011 Health
      ↓
RFC-0012 Finance
      ↓
RFC-0013 Education
      ↓
RFC-0014 Documents
      ↓
RFC-0015 Communication
```

Quality Profiles and compliance should remain capable of applying consistent cross-plugin quality requirements while preserving domain-specific semantics.

---

## Specifications Framework

Relevant FamilyOS specifications include:

```text id="wk77op"
SPEC-0001 — Structure
SPEC-0002 — Identifier
SPEC-0003 — Metadata
SPEC-0004 — Versioning
SPEC-0005 — Document Format
SPEC-0006
```

Specifications may provide normative requirements consumed by Quality Compliance.

---

## Specification Traceability

A specification requirement may become:

```text id="x4hdan"
Specification
      ↓
Quality Requirement
      ↓
Quality Rule
      ↓
Evidence
      ↓
Compliance Assessment
```

The Quality Framework should preserve this provenance.

---

## FamilyOS Reference Documentation

The FamilyOS reference directory provides common terminology and conventions.

Relevant documents include:

```text id="fvw414"
Acronyms.md
Glossary.md
Language.md
Naming-Conventions.md
Reference-Index.md
Reserved-Words.md
```

These are important for consistency across quality documentation and implementation.

---

## Glossary

`Glossary.md` should remain the authoritative reference for shared FamilyOS terminology where terms are defined globally.

Quality-specific terms may be introduced by this framework and later promoted into the global glossary when appropriate.

---

## Acronyms

`Acronyms.md` provides shared acronym definitions.

New quality acronyms should avoid conflicting definitions.

---

## Language

`Language.md` defines language conventions used across FamilyOS documentation.

Quality documentation should follow those conventions.

---

## Naming Conventions

`Naming-Conventions.md` defines shared naming rules.

Quality identifiers should remain compatible with this reference.

Examples include:

```text id="jruqa6"
QLT-REQ-...
QLT-RULE-...
QLT-EVID-...
QLT-RISK-...
QLT-GATE-...
```

The final identifier scheme should be aligned before implementation.

---

## Reserved Words

`Reserved-Words.md` should be consulted when introducing:

* quality status names;
* lifecycle states;
* CLI terminology;
* configuration vocabulary.

This avoids semantic conflicts across FamilyOS.

---

## Reference Index

`Reference-Index.md` provides discoverability for shared FamilyOS references.

The Quality Framework should eventually be indexed there.

---

## Repository Architecture

The Quality Framework must remain compatible with FamilyOS repository architecture.

Relevant concerns include:

```text id="mpv1zz"
Source Layout
Tests Layout
Documentation Layout
Plugin Layout
Configuration Layout
Generated Artifacts
```

Quality verification should validate repository expectations rather than invent parallel structures.

---

## Development Workflow

The FamilyOS Development Workflow is an important Quality Framework input.

Potential quality integration points include:

```text id="2lcm3h"
Local Development
Commit
Pull Request
Review
Merge
Build
Release
```

Quality Gates should map to actual engineering lifecycle boundaries.

---

## Coding Standards

FamilyOS Coding Standards may generate executable quality rules.

Examples include:

```text id="g0jrje"
Formatting
Typing
Naming
Imports
Maintainability
```

Tools such as Ruff and MyPy implement portions of these expectations.

---

## Toolchain

The Engineering Toolchain is an important implementation reference.

Current quality-relevant tooling includes:

```text id="h1jymh"
Python
Pytest
Ruff
MyPy
Git
```

Tool-specific behavior should not replace Quality Framework semantics.

---

## Environment Management

Quality verification should remain compatible with FamilyOS environment management.

Relevant concerns include:

```text id="rbpmzx"
Python Version
Development Environment
CI Environment
Dependency State
Reproducibility
```

---

## Dependency Management

Dependency policy influences:

```text id="krl2u2"
Security
Compatibility
Build
Reliability
Maintainability
```

Quality checks may verify dependency state while the Engineering Foundation remains authoritative for dependency management principles.

---

## Configuration Management

Configuration quality may depend on:

```text id="q4hqim"
Schema
Validation
Environment Overrides
Default Values
Compatibility
Security
```

The Quality Framework may consume configuration validation evidence.

---

## Framework Lifecycle

The broader FamilyOS Framework Lifecycle is an important reference for the Quality Framework Lifecycle.

Quality-specific lifecycle rules should specialize rather than contradict the broader framework model.

---

## Governance Architecture

`Governance-Architecture.md` provides broader governance principles.

Quality Governance should align with:

```text id="f2h2b2"
Authority
Ownership
Decision Traceability
Policy
Lifecycle
Escalation
```

---

## Observability Architecture

`Observability-Architecture.md` provides platform-wide observability principles.

Quality Observability specializes these concepts for engineering quality data.

---

## Event Architecture

`Event-Architecture.md` is relevant if Quality Automation and Quality Observability emit structured events such as:

```text id="wwenpc"
quality.finding.created
quality.assessment.completed
quality.gate.failed
quality.risk.created
```

Quality events must conform to FamilyOS event architecture.

---

## Notification Architecture

`Notification-Architecture.md` becomes relevant when significant quality conditions generate notifications.

Examples include:

```text id="6pqzs2"
Critical Finding
Release Gate Failure
Expired Exception
Critical Risk
```

---

## CLI Architecture

`CLI-Architecture.md` governs future quality CLI integration.

Potential commands such as:

```text id="8qvxwu"
familyos quality check
familyos quality assess
familyos quality report
familyos quality compliance
familyos quality gate
```

must follow FamilyOS CLI architecture and command conventions.

---

## API Architecture

If a future Quality Platform exposes APIs, they should comply with `API-Architecture.md`.

---

## Integration Architecture

Cross-framework quality integrations should follow `Integration-Architecture.md`.

Examples include integration with:

* plugin compliance;
* testing;
* build;
* release;
* observability;
* notification.

---

## Runtime Architecture

Runtime quality mechanisms must remain compatible with `Runtime-Architecture.md`.

The Quality Framework should not introduce a parallel runtime model.

---

## Infrastructure Architecture

Quality Automation infrastructure should align with `Infrastructure-Architecture.md`.

Relevant concerns include:

```text id="jpmvd9"
CI Execution
Artifact Storage
Telemetry
Credentials
Isolation
Reliability
```

---

## Deployment Architecture

Deployment-related Quality Gates should align with `Deployment-Architecture.md`.

---

## Generation Architecture

Quality automation may validate generated artifacts.

Any quality integration with generators should follow `Generation-Architecture.md`.

---

## Identity Architecture

Quality evidence, approvals, risk acceptance, exceptions, and overrides may require identity.

Such identity semantics should follow `Identity-Architecture.md`.

---

## Domain Architecture

Quality domains must not conflict with FamilyOS domain architecture.

The Quality Framework is a cross-cutting engineering framework, not a business domain replacement.

---

## Application Architecture

Quality application services should follow `Application-Architecture.md`.

Future quality implementation should separate:

```text id="nxtu64"
Domain Models
Application Services
Infrastructure Adapters
CLI / Presentation
```

---

## Clean Architecture

The existing FamilyOS engineering approach favors Clean Architecture.

Quality implementation should preserve dependency direction.

Conceptually:

```text id="i5xg3n"
Presentation
      ↓
Application
      ↓
Domain

Infrastructure
      ↓
Application / Domain Contracts
```

---

## Domain-Driven Design

Where appropriate, Quality Framework implementation should use explicit domain language.

Core concepts include:

```text id="4v2o2x"
QualityFinding
QualityEvidence
QualityAssessment
QualityRisk
QualityGate
QualityProfile
```

These concepts should remain semantically stable.

---

## Quality Tools

Current tooling provides important implementation references.

### Ruff

Ruff provides Python linting and static checks.

Quality integration should normalize its results into the FamilyOS Quality model.

### MyPy

MyPy provides static type verification.

### Pytest

Pytest provides test execution and test evidence.

These tools remain implementation mechanisms.

They are not themselves the Quality Framework.

---

## Git

Git provides revision identity and historical context required by:

```text id="i5ld1a"
Evidence
Assessments
Quality Gates
Compliance
Release Traceability
```

Quality evidence should bind to Git revision where appropriate.

---

## CI Systems

CI systems provide execution infrastructure.

The specific CI provider should remain replaceable.

Quality semantics should therefore live outside provider-specific configuration where practical.

---

## External Standards

The initial Quality Framework is primarily governed by FamilyOS internal engineering requirements.

External standards may become relevant later.

Potential categories include:

```text id="6tvydi"
Software Quality Standards
Security Standards
Supply Chain Standards
Documentation Standards
Compliance Standards
```

External standards should only become normative when explicitly adopted by FamilyOS Governance.

---

## ISO/IEC 25010

ISO/IEC 25010 may provide informative quality model concepts.

Potential quality characteristics include:

```text id="hvr9k9"
Functional Suitability
Performance Efficiency
Compatibility
Usability
Reliability
Security
Maintainability
Portability
```

FamilyOS may use compatible concepts without requiring direct certification.

---

## ISO 9001

General quality management principles from ISO 9001 may provide informative context for:

* quality management;
* continuous improvement;
* evidence;
* process governance.

This does not imply FamilyOS certification.

---

## OWASP

OWASP materials may provide informative and security-specific reference guidance.

Security Frameworks and Architecture should determine which OWASP guidance becomes authoritative.

---

## NIST

NIST guidance may become relevant for security, risk, or software supply chain practices.

Any adoption should be explicit.

---

## SLSA

Supply-chain security concepts such as SLSA may become relevant for:

```text id="um54j6"
Build Provenance
Artifact Integrity
Release Evidence
```

This should remain a future integration unless formally adopted.

---

## SARIF

SARIF may be useful as an interoperability format for static analysis findings.

The Quality Framework may support SARIF adapters while preserving the internal FamilyOS Quality model.

---

## JUnit XML

JUnit XML may be used as an interoperability format for test results.

Quality Evidence should normalize it into FamilyOS semantics.

---

## JSON

JSON is a likely machine-readable format for:

```text id="lyyk6r"
Quality Evidence
Assessments
Reports
Compliance Results
```

The exact schemas should be versioned.

---

## YAML

YAML may be appropriate for:

```text id="vpxrzt"
Quality Profiles
Rule Configuration
Gate Policy
Framework Metadata
```

where human-editable configuration is required.

---

## Reference Stability

References should remain stable enough to support long-lived traceability.

When referenced artifacts move or are renamed, the Quality Framework should update references deliberately.

---

## Reference Versioning

Where semantics depend on a specific version, the reference should identify that version.

Example:

```text id="4rfcej"
Quality Profile X
requires Plugin Compliance Framework v2 semantics.
```

Version coupling should be minimized where possible.

---

## Reference Drift

Reference Drift occurs when a referenced artifact changes while dependent quality semantics remain based on older assumptions.

Conceptually:

```text id="a03utx"
Referenced Framework Changes
      ↓
Dependent Quality Requirement Not Reviewed
      ↓
Semantic Drift
```

Cross-framework changes should therefore trigger impact analysis.

---

## Reference Validation

Automated documentation validation should eventually verify:

```text id="l2x86m"
Referenced File Exists
Referenced Identifier Exists
Referenced Framework Is Active
Deprecated Reference Is Visible
```

---

## Broken Reference

Broken normative references should produce Quality Findings.

Example:

```text id="byeh2x"
QLT-REQ-ARCH-004

Authority:
ADR-0099

ADR-0099:
Not Found

Result:
Governance / Traceability Finding
```

---

## Deprecated Reference

References to deprecated frameworks should be reviewed.

They may remain valid temporarily during migration.

---

## Retired Reference

Active quality policy should not normally depend on retired authoritative artifacts.

If required for historical interpretation, the historical context should remain explicit.

---

## Reference Ownership

Each framework owner is responsible for maintaining the validity of references from their framework where feasible.

Cross-framework ownership may require coordination.

---

## Cross-Framework Traceability

FamilyOS should eventually support traceability such as:

```text id="dnx40n"
ADR-0007
      ↓
Plugin Requirement
      ↓
Plugin Compliance Rule
      ↓
Quality Evidence
      ↓
Plugin Assessment
      ↓
Plugin Gate
```

This is a strategic Quality Governance capability.

---

## Reference Registry

A future internal registry may maintain:

```text id="chnn2g"
Reference ID
Type
Location
Status
Version
Owner
Authority
```

This may support automated traceability validation.

---

## Reference Categories

A conceptual classification may include:

```text id="ypkpqf"
FOUNDATION
ARCHITECTURE
FRAMEWORK
ADR
RFC
SPECIFICATION
REFERENCE
TOOL
EXTERNAL_STANDARD
```

---

## Foundation References

Foundation references define broad FamilyOS principles.

Examples:

```text id="4rbxga"
Engineering Constitution
Engineering Foundation
Architecture Vision
Governance Architecture
```

---

## Framework References

Framework references define specialized engineering capabilities.

Examples:

```text id="2i1hmc"
Testing Framework
Documentation Framework
Build Framework
Release Framework
Plugin Compliance Framework
```

---

## Decision References

Decision references include:

```text id="4ny7j5"
ADR
RFC
```

They establish significant architectural or capability decisions.

---

## Specification References

Specifications define precise normative contracts.

These are particularly important for compliance and compatibility.

---

## Tool References

Tool references explain implementation mechanisms.

They should remain subordinate to quality policy.

---

## External References

External standards and formats should remain informative until explicitly adopted as normative FamilyOS requirements.

---

## Reference Priority

When implementation questions arise, engineers should prefer:

```text id="5ghit3"
Authoritative FamilyOS Source
      ↓
Current Framework Documentation
      ↓
Approved Decision
      ↓
Specification
      ↓
Tool Documentation
      ↓
External Guidance
```

depending on the nature of the question.

---

## Conflict Resolution

If references appear to conflict:

```text id="n7sy7u"
Identify Authority
      ↓
Identify Version
      ↓
Identify Scope
      ↓
Consult Governance Hierarchy
      ↓
Resolve Explicitly
```

Conflicts should not be resolved silently by tool behavior.

---

## Cross-Framework Conflict

A conflict between two FamilyOS frameworks should trigger governance review.

Example:

```text id="qibg23"
Testing Framework
      ↓
requires behavior A

Quality Profile
      ↓
requires incompatible behavior B
```

The Quality Framework should not independently override the Testing Framework.

---

## Reference Maintenance

References should be reviewed during:

```text id="rns7f7"
Framework Release
Major Architecture Change
Framework Migration
Document Rename
Deprecation
Retirement
```

---

## Reference Audit

A periodic reference audit may check:

```text id="g98rlg"
Broken References
Deprecated References
Conflicting References
Missing Authorities
Duplicated Requirements
```

---

## Reference Quality Metrics

Potential metrics may include:

```text id="ehn0le"
Broken Reference Count
Deprecated Reference Count
Unresolved Authority Count
Reference Validation Failure Count
```

These should remain simple and actionable.

---

## Reference Automation

Future automation may:

* validate file references;
* validate ADR/RFC identifiers;
* detect deprecated references;
* generate reference graphs;
* identify orphaned requirements.

---

## Reference Graph

A future reference graph may represent:

```text id="wl1xzk"
Engineering Constitution
      ↓
Engineering Foundation
      ↓
Quality Framework
      ↓
Quality Requirement
      ↓
Quality Rule
      ↓
Quality Gate
```

and:

```text id="cr540h"
ADR
      ↓
Plugin Compliance Requirement
      ↓
Quality Assessment
```

This would provide strong governance traceability.

## AI-Assisted Reference Analysis

AI may assist with:

* identifying related documents;
* detecting possible semantic conflicts;
* summarizing framework dependencies;
* finding outdated references.

AI must not determine normative authority independently.

---

## Historical References

Older or superseded documents may remain relevant for historical understanding.

They should be clearly marked as historical.

Historical references must not silently become current authority.

---

## Reference Archival

Retired references may be archived while preserving access for:

* historical assessments;
* release reconstruction;
* governance history.

---

## Reference Documentation Pattern

Where practical, FamilyOS framework documents should use a consistent reference structure.

Example:

```text id="ok6f1z"
Reference
Type
Authority
Purpose
Relationship
Status
```

This improves discoverability.

---

## Quality Framework Primary Reference Set

The primary FamilyOS reference set for the Quality Framework is:

```text id="9al7he"
Engineering Constitution

EPIC-ENG-001
Engineering Foundation

EPIC-TST-001
Testing Framework

EPIC-DOC-001
Documentation Framework

EPIC-BLD-001
Build Framework

EPIC-REL-001
Release Framework

EPIC-PLUGIN-002
Plugin Compliance Framework

FamilyOS Architecture Foundation

ADR-0007
Official Plugins Architecture

RFC-0010 through RFC-0015
Official Plugin RFCs

FamilyOS Specifications

FamilyOS Reference Documentation
```

These references represent the immediate architectural ecosystem surrounding the Quality Framework.

---

## Secondary Reference Set

Secondary references include:

```text id="uw32ol"
Tool Documentation
Interoperability Formats
External Quality Models
Security Standards
Supply Chain Standards
```

These become normative only when explicitly adopted.

---

## Reference Dependency Model

The Quality Framework dependency relationship can be represented as:

```text id="dwrcef"
                   FamilyOS Vision
                         ↓
             Engineering Constitution
                         ↓
                 Architecture Foundation
                         ↓
                Engineering Foundation
                         ↓
        ┌───────────────────────────────────┐
        │ Testing Framework                 │
        │ Documentation Framework           │
        │ Build Framework                   │
        │ Release Framework                 │
        │ Plugin Compliance Framework       │
        └───────────────────────────────────┘
                         ↓
                   Quality Framework
                         ↓
        ┌───────────────────────────────────┐
        │ Quality Requirements              │
        │ Quality Evidence                  │
        │ Quality Assessments               │
        │ Quality Gates                     │
        │ Quality Compliance                │
        │ Quality Governance                │
        └───────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

## Reference Responsibility Model

The Quality Framework should follow this responsibility rule:

```text id="0xz05t"
Domain Framework Defines Domain Semantics

Quality Framework Integrates Quality State

Quality Governance Coordinates Cross-Domain Decisions
```

Examples:

```text id="0kicjm"
Testing Framework
      → defines testing

Quality Framework
      → evaluates testing evidence

Release Framework
      → defines release lifecycle

Quality Framework
      → provides release quality state
```

---

## Avoiding Semantic Duplication

The Quality Framework must not duplicate specialized domain standards unnecessarily.

Avoid:

```text id="vym24u"
Quality Framework
      ↓
redefines complete testing methodology
```

Prefer:

```text id="qgcxpl"
Testing Framework
      ↓
Testing Evidence
      ↓
Quality Framework
```

This keeps FamilyOS modular.

---

## Reference Anti-Patterns

The Quality Framework rejects several reference anti-patterns.

### Untraceable Requirement

A mandatory Quality Requirement should have identifiable authority.

### Copy Instead of Reference

Do not duplicate complete framework semantics unnecessarily.

### Tool Documentation as Policy

Tool behavior should not replace FamilyOS authority.

### Outdated Reference

Deprecated or retired documents should not silently govern active quality behavior.

### Ambiguous Authority

References should make clear whether they are normative or informative.

### Reference Explosion

Do not reference documents that provide no meaningful quality context.

### Broken Cross-Framework Links

Important references should be validated.

### Hidden External Standard

External requirements should not become mandatory without explicit adoption.

---

## Initial Reference Management

The initial implementation can remain documentation-based.

At minimum:

```text id="s99fh6"
Normative references are listed.

Referenced identifiers are explicit.

Cross-framework relationships are documented.

Important references are manually reviewed.
```

---

## Future Reference Management

As FamilyOS matures, reference management may evolve toward:

```text id="js0mbd"
Structured Metadata
      ↓
Automated Reference Validation
      ↓
Requirement Provenance
      ↓
Reference Graph
      ↓
Cross-Framework Impact Analysis
```

---

## Strategic Outcome

A strong reference model enables FamilyOS to move from:

```text id="9b7hab"
This quality rule exists because it seems consistent
with our engineering practices.
```

toward:

```text id="9vjkxi"
This Quality Rule verifies QLT-REQ-ARCH-004.

QLT-REQ-ARCH-004 derives from ADR-0007 and the
FamilyOS Plugin Architecture.

The rule produces architecture evidence.

That evidence contributes to the Official Plugin
Quality Assessment and Plugin Quality Gate.
```

This provides significantly stronger engineering traceability.

---

## Final Reference Principle

The Quality Framework must remain deeply integrated with the FamilyOS engineering ecosystem without becoming a duplicate of that ecosystem.

References establish the links between:

```text id="1mkq3d"
Vision
   ↓
Architecture
   ↓
Engineering Frameworks
   ↓
Requirements
   ↓
Verification
   ↓
Quality Evidence
   ↓
Quality Decisions
```

Through explicit normative dependencies, authority hierarchy, cross-framework traceability, version awareness, reference validation, and disciplined separation of responsibilities, the FamilyOS Quality Framework can evolve as a coherent component of the broader platform rather than as an isolated quality layer.
