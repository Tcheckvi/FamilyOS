# Quality Framework

## 24 Release

### Overview

This document defines the release model for EPIC-QLT-001 — Quality Framework.

The purpose of the release process is to ensure that the Quality Framework becomes an authoritative FamilyOS engineering artifact only after its documentation, structure, cross-framework relationships, validation evidence, governance state, and implementation expectations are sufficiently complete.

The release model distinguishes between:

```text id="4w8jv9"
Framework Documentation Release
      ↓
Authoritative Quality Model

and

Framework Implementation Release
      ↓
Executable Quality Platform Capability
```

These are related but separate milestones.

The completion of EPIC-QLT-001 documentation establishes the normative Quality Framework architecture.

It does not automatically imply that every quality mechanism described by the framework has already been implemented.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of the release process is to provide a controlled transition from:

```text id="f9czku"
Draft Quality Architecture
```

to:

```text id="ufvc47"
Validated and Authoritative Quality Framework
```

The release process ensures that the framework:

* has a defined version;
* has a complete canonical structure;
* has passed required validation;
* contains no unresolved blocking findings;
* has consistent normative semantics;
* has traceable references;
* has documented implementation boundaries;
* has explicit lifecycle state;
* has a recorded release history.

---

## Release Principle

The foundational principle is:

> A Quality Framework release must represent a known, validated, reproducible, and governed framework state.

A release should not simply represent the moment when documentation writing stopped.

It should represent an explicit engineering decision that the framework is ready to become authoritative.

---

## Release Scope

The release scope includes the normative EPIC-QLT-001 documentation set and associated control artifacts.

Conceptually:

```text id="7b5gbe"
EPIC-QLT-001
├── Normative Chapters
├── Metadata
├── Manifest
├── Changelog
├── Validation Evidence
├── Revision History
└── Release State
```

---

## Release Units

The Quality Framework may evolve through several release units.

### Documentation Release

A Documentation Release establishes or updates the normative framework definition.

### Implementation Release

An Implementation Release introduces executable quality capabilities aligned with the framework.

### Policy Release

A Policy Release changes authoritative quality requirements, profiles, gates, or governance semantics.

### Maintenance Release

A Maintenance Release corrects documentation or implementation defects without materially changing framework semantics.

---

## Documentation Release

The first major EPIC-QLT-001 milestone is the Quality Framework Documentation Release.

Its objective is to establish:

```text id="da1aqp"
Context
Vision
Principles
Architecture
Quality Model
Requirements
Metrics
Evidence
Risk
Defect and Debt Management
Reviews and Assessments
Automation
Observability
Gates
Compliance
Continuous Improvement
Governance
Lifecycle
Roadmap
References
Validation
Summary
Release Model
Implementation Checklist
```

---

## Documentation Release Outcome

After successful release, the documentation becomes the authoritative conceptual foundation for future Quality Framework implementation.

The state may be represented as:

```text id="gm9905"
Framework Definition:
RELEASED

Framework Implementation:
PLANNED / PARTIAL
```

depending on actual implementation progress.

---

## Implementation Release

Implementation releases should progressively realize the roadmap.

Potential implementation milestones include:

```text id="dkjgx7"
Core Quality Domain Models
Quality Findings
Quality Evidence
Tool Adapters
Quality Assessment Engine
Quality CLI
CI Integration
Quality Profiles
Quality Gates
Quality Observability
Quality Governance Automation
```

Each implementation release should preserve alignment with the normative framework.

---

## Release Version

Every authoritative framework release should have a defined version.

Conceptually:

```text id="qbqn11"
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
```

Example:

```text id="pm7lja"
1.0.0
```

The exact version should align with the FamilyOS Release Framework.

---

## Version Semantics

A conceptual semantic versioning model may be:

```text id="h675li"
MAJOR
      → breaking normative or architectural change

MINOR
      → backward-compatible capability expansion

PATCH
      → corrections and non-semantic maintenance
```

The Release Framework remains authoritative for final versioning policy.

---

## Initial Release

The initial normative release of EPIC-QLT-001 may be considered:

```text id="dqdmwb"
v1.0.0
```

when:

* all required normative documents are complete;
* structural validation passes;
* cross-framework review is complete;
* references are valid;
* blocking validation findings are resolved;
* release control artifacts are updated.

The actual repository tag should be chosen according to the broader FamilyOS release sequence.

---

## Release Identity

A Quality Framework release should be identifiable through:

```text id="0q09xp"
EPIC Identifier
Framework Version
Git Revision
Release Tag
Release Date
```

This allows historical reconstruction.

---

## Git Revision

The release must bind to a specific Git revision.

Conceptually:

```text id="s7s6v9"
Framework Version
      ↓
Git Commit
      ↓
Immutable Repository State
```

---

## Release Tag

The release should use an annotated Git tag according to FamilyOS release conventions.

A conceptual tag may resemble:

```text id="rjdoyd"
vX.Y.Z-quality-framework
```

The actual version must remain coordinated with repository-wide versioning.

---

## Tag Principle

A release tag should only be created after validation has been completed successfully.

Incorrect:

```text id="zpndju"
Tag
  ↓
Validation
```

Preferred:

```text id="vkv9f1"
Validation
  ↓
Release Decision
  ↓
Tag
```

---

## Release Candidate

Significant releases may use a release candidate state.

Conceptually:

```text id="xt4xsn"
Framework Draft
      ↓
Release Candidate
      ↓
Final Validation
      ↓
Release
```

A release candidate should be sufficiently complete for final validation.

---

## Release Candidate State

A release candidate should have:

```text id="0brsji"
Complete Documentation
Stable Structure
Known Version
No Unresolved Structural Changes
Validation Ready
```

---

## Release Readiness

Release readiness requires more than file completeness.

A Quality Framework release is ready when:

```text id="ftmz4r"
Structure
      PASS

Content
      PASS

Architecture
      PASS

Cross-Framework Alignment
      PASS

References
      PASS

Governance
      PASS

Lifecycle
      PASS

Blocking Validation Findings
      0
```

---

## Release Readiness Checklist

A minimum release readiness checklist should include:

```text id="wfrtnd"
[ ] Canonical file inventory verified
[ ] All required chapters complete
[ ] No empty normative files
[ ] Naming and numbering consistent
[ ] Cross-framework responsibilities reviewed
[ ] Normative references verified
[ ] Terminology consistent
[ ] Quality lifecycle defined
[ ] Governance authority defined
[ ] Roadmap coherent
[ ] Validation completed
[ ] Blocking findings resolved
[ ] Changelog updated
[ ] Revision history updated
[ ] EPIC metadata updated
[ ] Release version defined
```

---

## Canonical Structure Validation

Before release, the canonical EPIC structure should be checked.

Example:

```text id="nt3u92"
find docs/epics/EPIC-QLT-001-quality-framework \
  -maxdepth 1 \
  -type f \
  | sort
```

The resulting inventory should match the authoritative manifest.

---

## Empty File Validation

Before release:

```text id="l7lw1h"
find docs/epics/EPIC-QLT-001-quality-framework \
  -maxdepth 1 \
  -type f \
  -empty
```

should return no required normative documents.

---

## Markdown Validation

Markdown validation should confirm:

```text id="h6o6to"
Heading Structure
Code Fence Integrity
Tables
Lists
Internal References
Formatting
```

according to the Documentation Framework.

---

## Reference Validation

Important references should be validated before release.

Examples include:

```text id="ag7soo"
EPIC-ENG-001
EPIC-TST-001
EPIC-DOC-001
EPIC-BLD-001
EPIC-REL-001
EPIC-PLUGIN-002
ADR-0007
RFC-0010 through RFC-0015
```

Unknown or obsolete normative references should be resolved.

---

## Cross-Framework Validation

The release should confirm that EPIC-QLT-001 does not incorrectly duplicate responsibilities belonging to:

```text id="r9pdwi"
Testing Framework
Documentation Framework
Build Framework
Release Framework
Plugin Compliance Framework
Security Architecture
Architecture Foundation
```

---

## Quality Model Validation

Core concepts should be coherent across the complete framework.

At minimum:

```text id="fvbeml"
Requirement
Rule
Evidence
Finding
Metric
Risk
Defect
Debt
Assessment
Gate
Compliance
Governance
```

must have non-conflicting semantics.

---

## Severity Validation

Severity semantics should remain consistent across the framework.

A release should not contain incompatible definitions of:

```text id="98ml9y"
INFO
LOW
MEDIUM
HIGH
CRITICAL
```

unless a specialized mapping is explicitly documented.

---

## Lifecycle Validation

Lifecycle semantics should be consistent for:

```text id="p662fn"
Framework
Requirement
Rule
Profile
Gate
Metric
Evidence
Automation
```

---

## Governance Validation

The release should define sufficient authority for:

```text id="tuykeq"
Quality Policy
Requirements
Rules
Profiles
Risk Acceptance
Exceptions
Gate Overrides
Framework Evolution
```

---

## Release Validation Evidence

Release validation should produce traceable evidence.

Potential evidence includes:

```text id="3nd6es"
File Inventory
Validation Checklist
Reference Review
Architecture Review
Git Status
Test Results
Static Analysis Results
Framework Findings
```

---

## Validation Record

A release validation record may conceptually contain:

```text id="04jazz"
epic:
EPIC-QLT-001

version:
1.0.0

revision:
<git-revision>

validation:
PASS

blocking_findings:
0

release_ready:
true
```

---

## VALIDATION.md

The canonical `VALIDATION.md` control artifact should record the current validation state.

It should identify:

```text id="q2u0qh"
Validation Scope
Validation Date
Revision
Checks Performed
Findings
Known Limitations
Validation State
```

---

## Release Validation State

A release may use:

```text id="5lbgl2"
READY
NOT_READY
CONDITIONAL
```

---

## READY

`READY` means all mandatory release criteria are satisfied.

---

## NOT_READY

`NOT_READY` means at least one blocking release criterion remains unresolved.

---

## CONDITIONAL

`CONDITIONAL` means release is permitted only through explicit governance acceptance of known non-blocking limitations.

For the initial normative Quality Framework release, unconditional readiness should generally be preferred.

---

## Blocking Release Findings

Potential blocking release findings include:

```text id="x69v4i"
Missing Normative Chapter
Broken Critical Reference
Contradictory Quality Semantics
Undefined Governance Authority
Invalid Canonical Structure
Unresolved Critical Validation Finding
```

---

## Non-Blocking Release Findings

Potential non-blocking findings may include:

```text id="l4ahpg"
Future Automation Opportunity
Optional Cross-Reference Improvement
Minor Editorial Issue
Planned Implementation Capability
```

Such findings should remain documented.

---

## Known Limitations

The release should clearly identify known limitations.

For the initial documentation release, likely limitations may include:

```text id="243izx"
Executable Quality Engine Not Yet Implemented
Quality CLI Not Yet Implemented
Quality Gate Engine Not Yet Implemented
Quality Observability Platform Not Yet Implemented
Governance Registry Not Yet Implemented
```

These are implementation gaps, not necessarily framework-definition defects.

---

## Documentation vs Implementation Limitation

The release must preserve the distinction:

```text id="bjjjzy"
Normative Capability Defined
      ↓
Implementation Planned
```

A capability may be validly defined before implementation exists.

---

## Changelog

The framework changelog should describe release evolution.

A conceptual first release entry may contain:

```text id="my8wmx"
## 1.0.0

### Added

- Quality Framework architecture
- Quality model
- Requirements model
- Metrics model
- Evidence model
- Risk model
- Quality Debt model
- Assessment model
- Automation model
- Observability model
- Gate model
- Compliance model
- Governance model
- Lifecycle model
- Roadmap
```

The actual changelog format should follow FamilyOS Documentation and Release standards.

---

## Revision History

Revision history should preserve meaningful documentation evolution.

It may identify:

```text id="dhfuqt"
Version
Date
Summary
Status
```

---

## EPIC Metadata

`EPIC.yaml` should reflect release status accurately.

Potential fields include:

```text id="kpo1fb"
id
title
status
version
owner
framework
deliverables
dependencies
decisions
```

The exact schema should follow FamilyOS EPIC conventions.

---

## Status Transition

A conceptual EPIC status transition may be:

```text id="jpxpxd"
draft
  ↓
in-progress
  ↓
validation
  ↓
complete
```

The canonical FamilyOS status vocabulary remains authoritative.

---

## Manifest Validation

`MANIFEST.md` should identify the authoritative deliverables and normative hierarchy.

Before release, it should be synchronized with the actual EPIC structure.

---

## README Validation

The EPIC README should provide discoverability and summarize:

```text id="kqn6wc"
Purpose
Scope
Structure
Status
Relationships
```

---

## Release Notes

Release notes should communicate meaningful framework changes to FamilyOS engineers.

They should focus on:

* new normative expectations;
* migration requirements;
* implementation consequences;
* known limitations.

---

## Release Notes vs Changelog

The changelog records changes.

Release notes explain the impact of those changes.

Both may coexist.

---

## Release Package

If a release package is generated, it may contain:

```text id="2uhfaz"
Normative Documentation
Control Artifacts
Validation Report
Release Notes
```

The repository remains the authoritative source unless FamilyOS governance defines another source.

---

## Release Artifact Integrity

If packaged artifacts are produced, their contents should correspond to the tagged Git revision.

---

## Release Branch

The Quality Framework release should follow the repository's established branch and merge workflow.

The Release document should not redefine branch strategy.

---

## Merge Readiness

Before final integration, verify:

```text id="wya3jq"
git status --short
```

Unexpected uncommitted or unrelated changes should be resolved.

---

## Commit Structure

The final release may use one or more commits depending on repository workflow.

A release commit should be understandable and scoped appropriately.

---

## Commit Message

A conceptual commit message may be:

```text id="f15sye"
docs(quality): complete EPIC-QLT-001 Quality Framework
```

or another repository-compliant form.

---

## Tagging

After release readiness is confirmed, the release may be tagged.

A conceptual command is:

```text id="pfpbgb"
git tag -a <version-tag> \
  -m "EPIC-QLT-001 Quality Framework"
```

The exact tag must follow current FamilyOS release naming and version sequence.

---

## Tag Verification

After tagging:

```text id="rlu6bp"
git tag --list
```

or equivalent may confirm presence.

---

## Remote Publication

If the release is intended for remote publication:

```text id="a4zeih"
git push origin <branch>

git push origin <version-tag>
```

should occur according to repository policy.

Credentials and branch names remain environment-specific.

---

## Release Rollback

If a critical release problem is detected immediately after publication, the response should preserve history.

Avoid silently rewriting published release state.

Potential response:

```text id="ufquq2"
Release
      ↓
Critical Problem
      ↓
Corrective Commit
      ↓
New Patch Release
```

where practical.

---

## Tag Correction

Published tags should generally not be moved silently.

If a tag was created incorrectly and has not been shared, local correction may be possible.

Once published, release governance should determine the corrective approach.

---

## Release Immutability

A released framework version should represent an immutable historical state.

Changes after release should produce:

```text id="swrtzy"
New Commit
      ↓
New Framework Version
```

rather than rewriting the meaning of the existing version.

---

## Patch Release

A patch release may address:

```text id="ywu20h"
Typographical Corrections
Broken References
Minor Clarifications
Validation Fixes
Non-Semantic Documentation Errors
```

without intentionally changing normative architecture.

---

## Minor Release

A minor release may introduce backward-compatible framework capabilities.

Examples:

```text id="idwruh"
New Optional Quality Rule
New Metric
Additional Report
New Non-Breaking Quality Profile Capability
```

---

## Major Release

A major release may introduce:

```text id="4c8sbe"
Breaking Requirement Semantics
Changed Quality Gate Semantics
New Mandatory Compliance Model
Incompatible Quality Profile Changes
Major Governance Change
```

Such releases require migration planning.

---

## Framework Migration

When a release introduces breaking changes:

```text id="jcbuba"
Current Framework Version
      ↓
Impact Analysis
      ↓
Migration Guide
      ↓
Target Remediation
      ↓
Validation
      ↓
New Framework Version
```

---

## Migration Documentation

A breaking release should document:

```text id="5b4v9n"
What Changed
Why
Affected Targets
Required Actions
Compatibility Window
Validation
```

---

## Compatibility

Framework releases should identify compatibility with related FamilyOS frameworks where relevant.

Potential dependencies include:

```text id="55po9g"
Engineering Foundation
Testing Framework
Documentation Framework
Build Framework
Release Framework
Plugin Compliance Framework
```

---

## Compatibility State

A conceptual compatibility state may include:

```text id="nlqfqn"
COMPATIBLE
PARTIALLY_COMPATIBLE
MIGRATION_REQUIRED
INCOMPATIBLE
```

---

## Release Dependencies

A framework release should identify significant dependencies that must already exist.

For example:

```text id="9hld1n"
Quality Framework
      ↓
depends conceptually on

Engineering Foundation
Testing Framework
Documentation Framework
Architecture Foundation
```

---

## Dependency Release Coordination

If dependent frameworks change materially, the Quality Framework may require a compatibility review before release.

---

## Release Security

Release operations should preserve repository and artifact integrity.

Potential concerns include:

```text id="s85gsu"
Unauthorized Tagging
Modified Validation Evidence
Incorrect Revision
Artifact Tampering
Unauthorized Gate Override
```

---

## Release Authority

The actor or authority permitted to declare EPIC-QLT-001 released should be defined by FamilyOS governance.

For the current project stage, this may be lightweight, but the authority should still be explicit.

---

## Release Decision

A release decision should answer:

```text id="v0uvhz"
What is being released?

Which version?

Which revision?

Has validation passed?

What limitations remain?

Who authorized release?
```

---

## Release Decision Record

A conceptual record may contain:

```text id="ehm0q2"
framework:
EPIC-QLT-001

version:
1.0.0

revision:
abc123

validation:
PASS

known_limitations:
Implementation roadmap remains pending.

decision:
RELEASED
```

---

## Release Evidence

Release evidence should remain available for future reconstruction.

Important evidence includes:

```text id="ekax82"
Git Revision
Validation State
Changelog
Release Tag
Manifest
Known Findings
```

---

## Release Observability

Future Quality Observability may expose framework release history.

Example:

```text id="pzsa74"
EPIC-QLT-001

v1.0.0
RELEASED

v1.1.0
RELEASED

v2.0.0
MIGRATION_REQUIRED
```

---

## Release Metrics

Potential framework release metrics include:

```text id="jlump6"
Release Count
Validation Failure Count
Post-Release Correction Count
Migration Completion
Deprecated Version Usage
```

These metrics should only be introduced if they provide useful engineering insight.

---

## Post-Release Review

After significant framework releases, a review may evaluate:

```text id="8vqkcg"
Was the framework understandable?

Did implementation reveal semantic gaps?

Did new requirements create unexpected friction?

Were migration instructions sufficient?

Did any framework contradiction appear?
```

---

## Post-Release Findings

Problems discovered after release should create normal Quality Findings or framework defects.

A released framework is not assumed to be permanently perfect.

---

## Post-Release Improvement

The feedback loop is:

```text id="0bdmpe"
Framework Release
      ↓
Engineering Usage
      ↓
Observations
      ↓
Findings
      ↓
Continuous Improvement
      ↓
Next Framework Release
```

---

## Release and Continuous Improvement

Release is not the end of the Quality Framework lifecycle.

It marks the beginning of operational learning for that version.

---

## Framework Support

Released framework versions may eventually receive support classifications.

Conceptually:

```text id="9woyzg"
CURRENT
SUPPORTED
MIGRATION_ONLY
UNSUPPORTED
```

The Framework Lifecycle defines the broader model.

---

## Deprecation

A released framework version may later become deprecated.

Deprecation should communicate:

```text id="errejh"
Replacement
Migration
Timeline
Support Status
```

---

## Retirement

Retired versions should no longer govern current FamilyOS engineering.

Historical assessments and decisions must remain interpretable against them.

---

## Initial Quality Framework Release

For the initial EPIC-QLT-001 normative release, the release objective is:

```text id="2aixqj"
Establish the authoritative Quality Framework
documentation baseline for FamilyOS.
```

The release should confirm:

```text id="5dmynk"
Quality Architecture Defined
Quality Models Defined
Quality Governance Defined
Quality Lifecycle Defined
Quality Roadmap Defined
Validation Completed
```

---

## Initial Release Does Not Require

The first documentation release does not necessarily require the complete implementation of:

```text id="imkdji"
Quality CLI
Quality Evidence Store
Quality Assessment Engine
Quality Gate Engine
Quality Dashboard
Governance Registry
Quality Intelligence
```

These belong to the implementation roadmap.

---

## Initial Release Success Criteria

The first Quality Framework release is successful when FamilyOS has a coherent and validated answer to:

```text id="y1ldqv"
What is quality?

How is it defined?

How is it verified?

How is evidence represented?

How are findings managed?

How is risk handled?

How is Quality Debt governed?

How are assessments produced?

How are lifecycle decisions protected?

How is compliance demonstrated?

How does quality improve?

Who governs the system?

How will the framework evolve?
```

---

---

## Release Command Sequence

A conceptual final repository sequence may be:

```text id="phf1ox"
git status --short
```

then repository-specific validation commands, followed by:

```text id="8qm3sr"
git add docs/epics/EPIC-QLT-001-quality-framework
```

then:

```text id="zqvjk6"
git commit -m "docs(quality): complete EPIC-QLT-001 Quality Framework"
```

and finally, after successful validation:

```text id="c7q6i2"
git tag -a <quality-framework-tag> \
  -m "EPIC-QLT-001 Quality Framework completed"
```

The exact branch, tag, and version must follow the current repository release state.

---

## Release Verification

After tagging, verify:

```text id="1ir77h"
git status --short
git log -1 --oneline
git tag --list
```

The release should correspond to the intended commit.

---

## Remote Release Verification

After push, verify that:

```text id="sni7zp"
Branch Commit
      =
Tagged Commit
      =
Validated Commit
```

This protects release integrity.

---

## Release Failure

If validation fails:

```text id="2u5bkf"
Release Candidate
      ↓
Validation FAIL
      ↓
Remediation
      ↓
Revalidation
```

The release should not proceed by simply ignoring failed criteria.

---

## Release Exception

If a release exception is required, it must follow Quality Governance.

It should include:

```text id="yvkg63"
Blocking Condition
Reason
Risk
Authority
Mitigation
Expiration / Follow-Up
```

---

## Release Override

A Quality Gate override should be even more exceptional.

It must not rewrite the validation result.

Example:

```text id="h3tzl2"
Validation:
FAIL

Override:
Release Authorized

Historical Quality State:
FAIL remains recorded
```

---

## Release Auditability

A future engineer should be able to reconstruct:

```text id="9w6d59"
Which Quality Framework version was released?

Which commit defined it?

Which validation was performed?

Which findings remained?

Which exceptions existed?

Why was release authorized?
```

---

## Release Retention

Release records should remain available as part of FamilyOS engineering history.

Important records include:

```text id="3l2z06"
Tags
Commits
Changelog
Validation
Revision History
Release Notes
```

---

## Relationship With Quality Framework Lifecycle

The release state is one phase of the broader lifecycle.

```text id="k6j59v"
Design
      ↓
Validation
      ↓
Release
      ↓
Operation
      ↓
Improvement
      ↓
Evolution
```

---

## Relationship With Quality Governance

Quality Governance defines release authority, exceptions, and lifecycle rules.

This Release document defines how those concepts apply to EPIC-QLT-001.

---

## Relationship With Quality Validation

Validation produces the evidence required for release.

The relationship is:

```text id="z7wh96"
Framework
      ↓
Validation
      ↓
Validation Evidence
      ↓
Release Decision
```

---

## Relationship With Quality Gates

A mature FamilyOS system may eventually introduce an automated Quality Framework Release Gate.

Conceptually:

```text id="c9v5jw"
Framework Validation
      ↓
PASS
      ↓
Framework Release Gate
      ↓
Release
```

---

## Relationship With Release Framework

The FamilyOS Release Framework remains authoritative for:

```text id="b0wm0r"
Versioning
Tagging
Release Lifecycle
Release Publication
Release Governance
```

This document specializes those principles for the Quality Framework.

---

## Relationship With Documentation Framework

The Documentation Framework governs document structure, metadata, revision, and publication quality.

A Quality Framework documentation release must comply with those expectations.

---

## Relationship With Engineering Foundation

The Engineering Foundation defines repository workflow, development lifecycle, toolchain, and governance principles used during Quality Framework release.

---

## Relationship With Continuous Improvement

Post-release findings become inputs to Continuous Improvement.

No framework release should be treated as permanently final.

---

## Release Anti-Patterns

The FamilyOS Quality Framework rejects several release anti-patterns.

### Release Because Writing Stopped

Completion of drafting is not release readiness.

### Tag Before Validation

Tags should represent validated framework states.

### Documentation Release Equals Implementation Release

These milestones must remain distinct.

### Unversioned Framework Release

Authoritative framework states require identifiable versions.

### Moving Published Tags Silently

Historical release identity should remain stable.

### Hidden Known Limitations

Implementation gaps and known findings should remain visible.

### Release With Broken References

Normative references should be validated.

### Release Without Authority

The release decision should identify the responsible governance authority.

### Release Without Evidence

A framework release should be supported by validation evidence.

### Permanent First Version

The framework must remain capable of evolution.

## Release Maturity Model

Quality Framework release capability may mature through:

```text id="6psxdo"
Level 1
Manual Documentation Release

    ↓

Level 2
Versioned and Tagged Framework Release

    ↓

Level 3
Validation-Driven Release

    ↓

Level 4
Automated Documentation and Reference Validation

    ↓

Level 5
Quality Framework Release Gate

    ↓

Level 6
Cross-Framework Compatibility Validation

    ↓

Level 7
Continuously Governed Framework Release
```

## Strategic Outcome

The release model enables FamilyOS to move from:

```text id="72nqqa"
The Quality Framework documents are finished,
so we can consider the work done.
```

toward:

```text id="eqddeb"
The Quality Framework has a defined version.

Its canonical structure is complete.

Its normative semantics are internally consistent.

Its relationships with other FamilyOS frameworks
have been reviewed.

Its references have been validated.

Its known limitations are explicit.

Its validation evidence is bound to a Git revision.

Its release decision is traceable.

The resulting framework version can therefore
serve as an authoritative FamilyOS engineering baseline.
```

## Final Release Principle

A framework becomes authoritative not when it is merely written, but when a specific, validated, governed, and reproducible version is intentionally released.

The EPIC-QLT-001 release model therefore establishes the relationship:

```text id="2tvpog"
Framework Definition
      ↓
Validation
      ↓
Evidence
      ↓
Release Readiness
      ↓
Governance Decision
      ↓
Version
      ↓
Git Revision
      ↓
Tag
      ↓
Authoritative Framework Release
```

Through controlled versioning, validation, revision binding, changelog management, explicit release readiness, governance authority, immutable history, release evidence, and post-release improvement, FamilyOS ensures that every Quality Framework release represents a trustworthy engineering baseline rather than an arbitrary snapshot of documentation progress.
