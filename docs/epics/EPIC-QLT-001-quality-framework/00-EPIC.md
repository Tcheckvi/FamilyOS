# Quality Framework

## EPIC-QLT-001

### Quality Framework

Version: 1.0.0

Status: Completed

Owner: FamilyOS Engineering

---

## Overview

EPIC-QLT-001 establishes the official Quality Framework for the FamilyOS Engineering Platform.

Quality is not considered a final verification activity performed before release.

Instead, quality is an engineering capability continuously integrated into every phase of the software lifecycle.

The framework defines the principles, governance, processes, metrics, controls, validation mechanisms, and continuous improvement practices that ensure FamilyOS remains reliable, maintainable, secure, testable, observable, and evolvable throughout its lifetime.

This framework provides the common language and operating model used by every engineering team, framework, plugin, and contributor.

---

## Purpose

The Quality Framework exists to:

- define a unified quality vision;
- establish organization-wide quality principles;
- integrate quality into engineering workflows;
- define measurable quality objectives;
- introduce quality governance;
- standardize quality verification;
- reduce technical debt;
- improve software reliability;
- improve engineering productivity;
- enable continuous improvement.

Quality becomes a permanent engineering responsibility shared by everyone involved in the platform.

---

## Scope

The Quality Framework defines:

- quality philosophy;
- quality governance;
- quality lifecycle;
- engineering quality standards;
- quality planning;
- quality metrics;
- quality objectives;
- quality gates;
- review processes;
- defect management;
- risk management;
- quality monitoring;
- continuous improvement.

The framework applies to:

- source code;
- documentation;
- architecture;
- APIs;
- plugins;
- infrastructure;
- deployment;
- releases;
- automation;
- CI/CD;
- operational processes.

---

## Relationship With FamilyOS Foundations

The Quality Framework extends and integrates with:

- Engineering Foundation
- Documentation Framework
- Testing Framework
- Build Framework
- Release Framework
- Security Architecture
- Observability Architecture
- Governance Architecture

Quality acts as the transversal capability connecting all engineering disciplines.

---

## Quality Vision

The FamilyOS quality vision is based on one principle:

> Every engineering activity contributes to product quality.

Quality is designed.

Quality is measured.

Quality is monitored.

Quality is continuously improved.

Quality is never considered complete.

---

## Core Principles

The framework is built around several engineering principles.

### Built-in Quality

Quality is designed from the beginning.

It cannot be added after implementation.

---

### Continuous Validation

Every modification is validated continuously through automated processes.

---

### Shift Left

Quality activities happen as early as possible.

---

### Shift Right

Operational feedback continuously improves engineering quality.

---

### Automation First

Every repeatable quality activity should be automated whenever possible.

---

### Measurable Quality

Quality must always be measurable using objective indicators.

---

### Continuous Improvement

Processes evolve through feedback and measurement.

---

### Engineering Responsibility

Quality belongs to every contributor.

It is never delegated to a single team.

---

## Framework Structure

The Quality Framework is organized into 26 canonical numbered documents.

```text
00-EPIC.md
01-Context.md
02-Vision.md
03-Quality-Principles.md
04-Quality-Architecture.md
05-Quality-Domains.md
06-Quality-Rule-Model.md
07-Quality-Profiles.md
08-Quality-Metrics.md
09-Quality-Evidence.md
10-Quality-Risk-Management.md
11-Defect-and-Quality-Debt-Management.md
12-Quality-Reviews-and-Assessments.md
13-Quality-Automation.md
14-Quality-Observability.md
15-Quality-Gates.md
16-Quality-Compliance.md
17-Continuous-Improvement.md
18-Quality-Governance.md
19-Framework-Lifecycle.md
20-Roadmap.md
21-References.md
22-Validation.md
23-Summary.md
24-Release.md
25-Implementation-Checklist.md
```

The numbered documentation is complemented by seven control artifacts:

```text
EPIC-QLT-001.md
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

Together, the canonical EPIC structure contains:

```text
26 numbered documents
+
7 control documents
=
33 canonical files
```

The authoritative structural inventory is maintained in `MANIFEST.md`.

## Expected Outcomes

After implementing this framework, FamilyOS will provide:

- standardized engineering quality;
- measurable engineering maturity;
- predictable releases;
- reduced defect rates;
- improved maintainability;
- improved software reliability;
- continuous quality monitoring;
- consistent engineering practices.

---

## Deliverables

This EPIC produces:

- Quality Vision
- Quality Principles
- Quality Standards
- Quality Metrics
- Quality Gates
- Governance Model
- Continuous Improvement Model
- Reference Documentation

---

## Success Criteria

The framework is considered complete when:

- quality standards are documented;
- quality metrics are defined;
- governance is established;
- quality gates are operational;
- continuous improvement process is defined;
- engineering workflows integrate quality controls;
- framework documentation reaches production readiness.

---

## Dependencies

This EPIC depends on:

- EPIC-ENG-001 — Engineering Foundation
- EPIC-DOC-001 — Documentation Framework
- EPIC-TST-001 — Testing Framework

Subsequent engineering frameworks build upon this Quality Framework.

---

## Future Evolution

Future versions may include:

- AI-assisted quality analysis;
- predictive quality indicators;
- automated governance reporting;
- engineering maturity assessment;
- self-improving quality dashboards;
- intelligent quality recommendations.

---

## Conclusion

The Quality Framework transforms quality into a permanent engineering capability.

Rather than treating quality as an isolated verification step, FamilyOS embeds quality into architecture, development, testing, delivery, operations, governance, and continuous improvement.

This framework ensures that every component of the FamilyOS ecosystem evolves according to consistent, measurable, and sustainable engineering quality standards.
