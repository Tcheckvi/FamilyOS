# Quality Framework

## 11 Defect and Quality Debt Management

### Overview

The FamilyOS Defect and Quality Debt Management model defines how defects, known deficiencies, deferred corrections, technical weaknesses, and accumulated quality debt are identified, classified, prioritized, tracked, remediated, verified, and governed.

The framework distinguishes between immediate defects and longer-term quality debt while preserving a shared lifecycle for visibility and accountability.

Defects may represent:

* incorrect behavior;
* failed requirements;
* security weaknesses;
* architecture violations;
* broken contracts;
* documentation errors;
* build failures;
* quality infrastructure problems.

Quality debt may represent:

* accepted defects;
* missing tests;
* incomplete automation;
* outdated documentation;
* architecture drift;
* deprecated dependencies;
* unresolved findings;
* manual verification requirements;
* temporary exceptions;
* maintainability weaknesses.

The objective is to prevent known deficiencies from becoming invisible or permanent through neglect.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of Defect and Quality Debt Management is to create a controlled mechanism for handling known quality deficiencies across the FamilyOS ecosystem.

Without explicit management, known problems may follow an uncontrolled lifecycle:

```text id="y3vk1d"
Problem Identified
      ↓
Deferred
      ↓
Forgotten
      ↓
Repeated
      ↓
Systemic Degradation
```

The desired lifecycle is:

```text id="qzlw6a"
Problem Identified
      ↓
Classified
      ↓
Prioritized
      ↓
Owned
      ↓
Remediated
      ↓
Verified
      ↓
Closed
      ↓
Learning
```

This model converts quality deficiencies into manageable engineering work.

---

## Foundational Principle

The foundational principle is:

> Known quality deficiencies must remain visible until they are resolved, explicitly accepted, or intentionally retired through governance.

A known problem must not disappear merely because:

* it is old;
* it is difficult;
* it is non-blocking;
* it was temporarily accepted;
* the responsible code has not changed recently.

Visibility is a prerequisite for control.

---

## Defect Definition

A Defect is an observed condition where a FamilyOS artifact fails to satisfy an applicable expectation.

A defect may occur in:

```text id="tk5fju"
Code
Architecture
Documentation
Configuration
Dependencies
Build
Release
Infrastructure
Quality Tooling
```

Conceptually:

```text id="0xt2uf"
Expected State
      ≠
Observed State
      ↓
Defect
```

A defect is supported by evidence.

---

## Quality Debt Definition

Quality Debt is a known unresolved condition that reduces engineering confidence, maintainability, reliability, or future development efficiency.

Conceptually:

```text id="8h1u83"
Known Quality Deficiency
      +
Deferred Resolution
      =
Quality Debt
```

Quality debt may originate from defects, exceptions, incomplete capabilities, or deliberate engineering compromises.

---

## Technical Debt and Quality Debt

Technical debt is a subset of the broader quality debt model.

Technical debt primarily concerns implementation and architecture trade-offs.

Quality debt additionally includes deficiencies in:

* testing;
* documentation;
* security;
* observability;
* compliance;
* build;
* release;
* governance;
* automation.

Therefore:

```text id="b4062o"
Technical Debt
      ⊂
Quality Debt
```

The broader model ensures that non-code deficiencies remain visible.

---

## Defect vs Finding

A Quality Finding represents the output of a quality check or assessment.

A Defect represents an acknowledged problem requiring remediation or explicit disposition.

Conceptually:

```text id="7327c8"
Quality Finding
      ↓
Triage
      ↓
Valid Problem?
      ├── No → False Positive / Closed
      └── Yes → Defect
```

Not every finding necessarily becomes a defect.

---

## Defect vs Risk

A defect is an observed problem.

A risk is the potential consequence associated with a condition.

Example:

```text id="0xkb4d"
Defect:
Missing validation on persisted family identifier

Risk:
Invalid or corrupted persisted data
```

Defect management and risk management therefore remain connected but distinct.

---

## Defect Identity

Every managed defect should have a stable identifier.

A conceptual format may be:

```text id="f4ufxn"
QLT-DEFECT-<NUMBER>
```

Examples:

```text id="qtpug1"
QLT-DEFECT-0001
QLT-DEFECT-0047
```

Identifiers support:

* ownership;
* reporting;
* evidence linkage;
* remediation tracking;
* release traceability.

---

## Quality Debt Identity

Significant quality debt items may use a dedicated identifier.

Conceptually:

```text id="5zn184"
QLT-DEBT-<DOMAIN>-<NUMBER>
```

Examples:

```text id="p59fdr"
QLT-DEBT-ARC-001
QLT-DEBT-TST-004
QLT-DEBT-DOC-008
```

A unified identifier model may also be used if implementation simplicity is preferable.

---

## Defect Metadata

A defect record may include:

```text id="ibqoyy"
id
title
description
domain
target
severity
priority
risk
status
owner
source
evidence
introduced_revision
detected_revision
created_at
resolved_at
verified_at
root_cause
remediation
```

The exact representation may evolve.

---

## Quality Debt Metadata

A debt record may include:

```text id="ujxg4w"
id
title
description
domain
target
reason
risk
priority
owner
created_at
target_resolution
status
source
related_findings
related_exceptions
remediation_plan
```

Debt records must remain actionable.

---

## Defect Sources

Defects may originate from:

```text id="2oa4pz"
Automated Tests
Static Analysis
Security Analysis
Architecture Validation
Documentation Validation
Manual Review
Production Incident
User Report
Quality Audit
Release Validation
```

The original source should remain traceable.

---

## Quality Debt Sources

Quality debt may originate from:

* deferred defects;
* accepted risk;
* temporary exceptions;
* incomplete migration;
* insufficient tests;
* architecture shortcuts;
* outdated dependencies;
* missing automation;
* documentation gaps;
* unsupported legacy behavior.

Debt may also be intentionally created when a short-term trade-off is explicitly accepted.

---

## Intentional Debt

Not all debt is accidental.

An engineering team may knowingly accept temporary debt to enable:

* incremental migration;
* critical delivery;
* experimentation;
* phased architecture change.

Intentional debt is acceptable only when it is:

```text id="674i1w"
Explicit
Owned
Risk-Assessed
Time-Bounded Where Appropriate
Tracked
```

Invisible intentional debt becomes unmanaged debt.

---

## Accidental Debt

Accidental debt may arise from:

* missing knowledge;
* incomplete review;
* unanticipated complexity;
* legacy behavior;
* defects discovered later.

Once identified, accidental debt must enter the same governance model as intentional debt.

---

## Defect Classification

Defects should be classified by Quality Domain.

Examples include:

```text id="pyci7m"
Correctness
Architecture
Security
Reliability
Performance
Testing
Documentation
Compatibility
Dependencies
Compliance
Build
Infrastructure
Governance
```

Primary classification supports ownership and reporting.

---

## Defect Severity

Defect severity should align with the common FamilyOS severity model:

```text id="1ccjyn"
INFO
LOW
MEDIUM
HIGH
CRITICAL
```

Severity represents impact.

It does not automatically define remediation priority.

---

## Defect Priority

Priority defines how quickly the defect should be addressed.

A conceptual model may include:

```text id="7um5hd"
P0
P1
P2
P3
P4
```

or:

```text id="ecsa24"
IMMEDIATE
HIGH
NORMAL
LOW
BACKLOG
```

The exact representation may be standardized later.

Priority should consider:

* severity;
* risk;
* target criticality;
* release timing;
* recurrence;
* remediation complexity.

---

## Severity vs Priority

Severity and priority must remain distinct.

Example:

```text id="0ae9vh"
Severity:
HIGH

Priority:
NORMAL
```

may be reasonable if the defect affects a disabled experimental capability.

Conversely:

```text id="02etbg"
Severity:
MEDIUM

Priority:
HIGH
```

may be appropriate if the issue blocks an imminent release.

---

## Defect Lifecycle

A baseline defect lifecycle may include:

```text id="8dgsjq"
OPEN
  ↓
TRIAGED
  ↓
ASSIGNED
  ↓
IN_PROGRESS
  ↓
RESOLVED
  ↓
VERIFIED
  ↓
CLOSED
```

Alternative terminal states may include:

```text id="gewo4g"
FALSE_POSITIVE
DUPLICATE
ACCEPTED_RISK
WONT_FIX
OBSOLETE
```

Each state must have defined semantics.

---

## OPEN

`OPEN` means the defect has been identified but not yet fully triaged.

---

## TRIAGED

`TRIAGED` means the defect has been validated and classified.

Triage should determine:

* domain;
* severity;
* priority;
* risk;
* ownership;
* release impact.

---

## ASSIGNED

`ASSIGNED` means an owner has accepted responsibility for remediation or disposition.

---

## IN_PROGRESS

`IN_PROGRESS` means active remediation is underway.

---

## RESOLVED

`RESOLVED` means a correction has been implemented or the underlying condition has otherwise been addressed.

Resolution is not yet final closure.

---

## VERIFIED

`VERIFIED` means evidence confirms that the defect no longer exists or the intended remediation is effective.

---

## CLOSED

`CLOSED` means the defect lifecycle is complete.

Closure should preserve historical records.

---

## FALSE_POSITIVE

A finding may be classified as a false positive when it does not represent an actual defect.

The reason should be recorded.

Frequent false positives should trigger rule quality review.

---

## DUPLICATE

Duplicate records should link to the authoritative defect.

Duplicates should not be independently remediated.

---

## ACCEPTED_RISK

A valid defect may remain unresolved because its associated risk has been explicitly accepted.

The defect should remain visible and linked to the risk acceptance.

---

## WONT_FIX

`WONT_FIX` should be used cautiously.

It represents a deliberate decision not to remediate.

The reason and authority must be documented.

For significant issues, risk acceptance may be more appropriate.

---

## OBSOLETE

A defect may become obsolete if:

* the affected component is removed;
* the functionality is replaced;
* the architecture changes fundamentally.

Obsolescence must be verified, not assumed.

---

## Quality Debt Lifecycle

Quality debt may follow a similar lifecycle:

```text id="um0e41"
IDENTIFIED
      ↓
ASSESSED
      ↓
PLANNED
      ↓
IN_PROGRESS
      ↓
REMEDIATED
      ↓
VERIFIED
      ↓
CLOSED
```

Alternative states may include:

```text id="cr8y5t"
ACCEPTED
DEFERRED
OBSOLETE
```

---

## Debt Creation

Debt should be created when a known quality deficiency cannot reasonably be resolved immediately.

Creation should capture:

```text id="697ziu"
What is missing?

Why is it deferred?

What risk exists?

Who owns it?

What is the expected remediation?
```

Debt entries without actionable context provide limited value.

---

## Debt Assessment

Debt should be assessed according to:

* impact;
* likelihood;
* target criticality;
* recurrence;
* engineering cost;
* future blocking potential.

This links debt management to the Quality Risk Management model.

---

## Debt Prioritization

Debt should be prioritized based on engineering risk rather than visibility or convenience.

A conceptual prioritization model may consider:

```text id="7kpt6j"
Risk
+
Age
+
Affected Scope
+
Change Frequency
+
Remediation Cost
+
Strategic Importance
```

No single factor should dominate blindly.

---

## Debt Age

Debt age measures how long a deficiency remains unresolved.

Conceptually:

```text id="j8m13p"
Debt Age
=
Current Date
-
Creation Date
```

Old debt is not automatically critical, but persistent high-risk debt requires review.

---

## Debt Interest

Some debt creates increasing future cost.

This effect can be described as debt interest.

Examples include:

* architecture coupling making future changes harder;
* missing tests increasing regression cost;
* outdated dependencies making future upgrades harder;
* documentation gaps spreading incorrect assumptions.

Debt with high interest should receive stronger remediation priority.

---

## Quality Debt Interest Model

Conceptually:

```text id="6ll96u"
Debt
  ↓
Repeated Engineering Friction
  ↓
Higher Future Cost
  ↓
Debt Interest
```

The framework does not require a numeric financial model.

The concept exists to recognize compounding engineering cost.

---

## Debt Impact Dimensions

Debt may affect:

```text id="wrm7yv"
Delivery Speed
Reliability
Security
Architecture
Testing
Documentation
Developer Experience
Release Confidence
```

Impact should remain explicit.

---

## Debt Categories

Quality debt may be categorized as:

```text id="4d5ccn"
Architecture Debt
Testing Debt
Security Debt
Documentation Debt
Dependency Debt
Automation Debt
Observability Debt
Compatibility Debt
Build Debt
Governance Debt
```

This supports domain-level reporting.

---

## Architecture Debt

Architecture debt may include:

* boundary violations;
* excessive coupling;
* temporary dependency inversions;
* duplicated abstractions;
* obsolete architecture layers.

Architecture debt often has high long-term interest.

---

## Testing Debt

Testing debt may include:

* missing tests;
* insufficient integration coverage;
* flaky tests;
* slow test suites;
* manual verification.

Testing debt reduces confidence in future changes.

---

## Security Debt

Security debt may include:

* accepted vulnerabilities;
* outdated security controls;
* missing hardening;
* temporary insecure configurations.

Security debt requires particularly careful governance.

---

## Documentation Debt

Documentation debt may include:

* outdated specifications;
* missing architecture documentation;
* incomplete migration guidance;
* undocumented public interfaces.

Documentation debt can generate implementation defects and repeated engineering confusion.

---

## Dependency Debt

Dependency debt may include:

* unsupported versions;
* outdated libraries;
* deprecated APIs;
* temporary compatibility shims.

Dependency debt may accumulate risk quickly if left unmanaged.

---

## Automation Debt

Automation debt includes quality activities that remain manual despite being suitable for automation.

Examples:

```text id="2n8q4r"
Manual Architecture Validation
Manual Documentation Checks
Manual Release Checklist
```

Automation debt increases inconsistency and engineering effort.

---

## Observability Debt

Observability debt may include:

* missing logs;
* missing metrics;
* insufficient traceability;
* incomplete health checks.

Operational defects are harder to diagnose when observability debt accumulates.

---

## Compatibility Debt

Compatibility debt may include:

* temporary adapters;
* deprecated interfaces;
* legacy schema support;
* migration shims.

Compatibility debt should have clear retirement strategies.

---

## Governance Debt

Governance debt may include:

* unowned rules;
* expired policies;
* unresolved exceptions;
* missing review;
* incomplete traceability.

Governance debt weakens the quality system itself.

---

## Debt Register

The framework may maintain a Quality Debt Register.

Conceptually:

```text id="f20hrg"
Quality Debt Register
      ├── Open Debt
      ├── Planned Debt
      ├── Accepted Debt
      └── Closed Debt
```

The register should provide platform-level visibility.

---

## Debt Register Entry

A debt entry should provide enough information for future engineers to understand the original context.

Recommended elements include:

```text id="zj22li"
ID
Title
Domain
Target
Reason
Risk
Owner
Created
Status
Remediation Plan
Related Evidence
```

---

## Debt Ownership

Every significant debt item must have an owner.

Ownership does not require immediate remediation.

It requires accountability for:

* monitoring;
* prioritization;
* status accuracy;
* remediation planning;
* escalation.

Unowned debt is likely to become invisible debt.

---

## Defect Ownership

Every active significant defect should have clear ownership.

Ownership may be assigned to:

* component owner;
* domain owner;
* framework owner;
* release owner.

Assignment should reflect the area capable of resolving the root cause.

---

## Defect Triage

Triage should occur as early as practical.

A triage process should answer:

```text id="7jixgk"
Is this a valid defect?

What domain is affected?

What severity applies?

What risk exists?

Who owns it?

Does it block progression?

Does it require immediate remediation?
```

---

## Automated Defect Creation

Certain quality checks may create defect records automatically.

Examples include:

* critical security findings;
* repeated architecture violations;
* failed release rules.

Automatic creation should be limited to meaningful issues to avoid backlog noise.

---

## Finding Promotion

A finding may become a managed defect according to policy.

Conceptually:

```text id="jx66q6"
Finding
      ↓
Severity / Persistence / Risk Evaluation
      ↓
Managed Defect?
```

Low-value findings may remain in tool or quality reports without becoming long-lived defect records.

---

## Defect Deduplication

Multiple checks may detect the same underlying problem.

The defect system should avoid duplicate remediation work.

Deduplication may use:

* target;
* rule;
* location;
* fingerprint;
* root cause.

Evidence from all sources should remain linked.

---

## Defect Fingerprint

A defect fingerprint may help identify recurrence.

Possible inputs include:

```text id="d42kp4"
Rule ID
Path
Symbol
Normalized Condition
```

Fingerprints must remain stable enough to support comparison without hiding genuinely new defects.

---

## Recurring Defects

A recurring defect is one that reappears after previous correction.

Recurrence should increase attention.

Conceptually:

```text id="mc4w9j"
Defect
  ↓
Resolved
  ↓
Reappears
  ↓
Systemic Analysis Required
```

Repeated defects indicate that the existing control may be insufficient.

---

## Root Cause Analysis

Significant defects should trigger root cause analysis where appropriate.

Root cause analysis should ask:

```text id="rrshxw"
Why was the defect introduced?

Why was it not prevented?

Why was it not detected earlier?

Which control should change?
```

The purpose is not blame.

The purpose is systemic prevention.

---

## Root Cause Categories

Possible root cause categories include:

```text id="4s5tvj"
Missing Requirement
Architecture Weakness
Implementation Error
Missing Test
Incorrect Test
Tool Failure
Documentation Gap
Process Gap
Dependency Change
Configuration Error
```

Categorization enables trend analysis.

---

## Corrective Action

Corrective action resolves the immediate defect.

Examples include:

* code fix;
* documentation correction;
* dependency upgrade;
* configuration change;
* test correction.

Corrective action addresses the observed problem.

---

## Preventive Action

Preventive action reduces recurrence.

Examples include:

* new automated rule;
* new regression test;
* architecture constraint;
* stronger validation;
* documentation improvement;
* process update.

The mature response is:

```text id="6g7gnv"
Correct Defect
      +
Prevent Recurrence
```

---

## Remediation Plan

A debt or significant defect may require a remediation plan.

A plan should include:

```text id="6uwr89"
Scope
Approach
Owner
Dependencies
Target State
Verification Method
```

Large remediation may be broken into staged work.

---

## Incremental Remediation

Large quality debt should support incremental reduction.

Example:

```text id="s4251m"
120 Architecture Violations
      ↓
Prevent New Violations
      ↓
Reduce to 80
      ↓
Reduce to 40
      ↓
Zero
```

Incremental remediation is preferable to indefinite deferral.

---

## New Debt Prevention

Baselines may allow existing debt while preventing new debt.

Conceptually:

```text id="4eb1m2"
Existing Debt
      ↓
Baseline

New Violation
      ↓
Blocked
```

This is one of the most effective migration strategies for legacy areas.

---

## Debt Baseline

A debt baseline should identify:

* source revision;
* accepted debt items;
* rule versions;
* evidence state.

The baseline must remain explicit.

---

## Baseline Reduction

The expected direction is:

```text id="wsi6lz"
Baseline N
      ↓
Debt Remediation
      ↓
Baseline N+1
      ↓
Smaller Debt Set
```

Baselines should progressively improve.

---

## Baseline Growth

Adding new debt to a baseline should require explicit justification.

A baseline must not become a mechanism for automatically accepting every new failure.

---

## Defect Verification

A defect is not complete merely because code changed.

Verification must demonstrate that the condition was corrected.

Possible verification includes:

* regression test;
* quality check;
* manual review;
* architecture validation;
* production observation.

---

## Regression Test Requirement

For meaningful functional defects, remediation should consider adding a regression test.

Conceptually:

```text id="rihva6"
Defect
  ↓
Fix
  ↓
Regression Test
  ↓
Future Protection
```

A regression test may not always be appropriate, but the possibility should be evaluated.

---

## Rule Improvement

If a defect could have been detected automatically earlier, the framework should consider improving a quality rule.

Example:

```text id="vl827c"
Manual Detection
      ↓
Repeated Problem
      ↓
Automated Rule
```

This converts experience into systemic protection.

---

## Documentation Improvement

Some defects reveal documentation deficiencies.

Example:

```text id="v3483p"
Incorrect Implementation
      ↓
Ambiguous Specification
      ↓
Fix Code
      +
Clarify Specification
```

The root cause may span multiple domains.

---

## Defect Closure Evidence

Closure should reference evidence proving resolution.

Example:

```text id="2jslbi"
Defect:
QLT-DEFECT-0042

Resolution:
Corrected boundary dependency

Verification:
Architecture check PASS

Evidence:
QLT-EVID-92AC11
```

This makes closure auditable.

---

## Debt Closure

Debt may be closed when:

* the deficiency is eliminated;
* the target is retired;
* the requirement is legitimately removed;
* the debt is otherwise rendered irrelevant.

Closure must not occur solely because the debt is old.

---

## Debt Verification

Debt remediation should verify the intended quality state.

Example:

```text id="gguybc"
Testing Debt:
Missing integration tests

Remediation:
Integration suite implemented

Verification:
Required integration profile passes
```

---

## Defect Reopening

A closed defect may be reopened if:

* remediation proves incomplete;
* recurrence occurs;
* new evidence demonstrates persistence.

Reopening preserves historical continuity.

---

## Debt Reopening

Closed debt may also be reopened when previously removed deficiencies return.

Recurrent debt should trigger deeper systemic analysis.

---

## Defect Aging

Long-lived defects should be visible.

Possible metrics include:

```text id="rm8ugc"
Average Defect Age
Oldest Open Defect
High Severity Defects > Threshold Age
```

Aging does not automatically determine priority, but it reveals neglect.

---

## Debt Aging

Debt aging should be analyzed alongside:

* risk;
* interest;
* recurrence;
* change frequency.

Old high-interest debt usually deserves stronger attention.

---

## Defect Metrics

Possible defect metrics include:

```text id="saq1on"
Open Defects
New Defects
Resolved Defects
Critical Defects
Defect Age
Mean Time to Resolution
Recurrence Rate
```

Metrics should support improvement rather than performance theater.

---

## Defect Escape Rate

A useful metric may compare defects detected before release with defects detected after release.

Conceptually:

```text id="p1sl71"
Defect Escape Rate
=
Post-Release Defects
/
Total Relevant Defects
```

Interpretation must account for defect severity and detection opportunities.

---

## Defect Recurrence Rate

A recurrence metric may help identify weak corrective processes.

```text id="2uqr09"
Recurrence Rate
=
Recurring Defects
/
Resolved Defects
```

High recurrence suggests that fixes are addressing symptoms rather than causes.

---

## Mean Time to Resolution

Defect remediation efficiency may be represented by:

```text id="zgr3fz"
MTTR
=
Total Resolution Time
/
Resolved Defect Count
```

Severity-specific MTTR may be more meaningful than one overall average.

---

## Quality Debt Metrics

Possible debt metrics include:

```text id="2zoa05"
Open Debt Count
Debt by Domain
High-Risk Debt
Average Debt Age
Debt Added
Debt Removed
Debt Reduction Rate
```

---

## Debt Trend

Debt trend may reveal whether quality is improving.

Example:

```text id="bqb4d6"
Release 1 → 120 debt items
Release 2 → 110
Release 3 → 94
Release 4 → 72
```

The count alone should still be interpreted with severity and scope.

---

## Debt Creation Rate

A high creation rate may indicate systemic engineering problems.

Conceptually:

```text id="01g2ha"
New Debt Created
      >
Debt Remediated
      ↓
Growing Quality Debt
```

This trend should trigger framework review.

---

## Debt Burn-Down

A debt burn-down may track planned reduction.

Example:

```text id="yq9g2q"
100
 ↓
80
 ↓
60
 ↓
30
 ↓
0
```

Burn-down targets should focus on meaningful debt rather than arbitrary counts.

---

## Debt Density

Debt may occasionally be normalized against repository scope.

Example:

```text id="07a5zd"
Architecture Debt per Module
```

Such metrics should be used cautiously.

---

## Defect Distribution

Defects may be grouped by:

* domain;
* severity;
* component;
* root cause;
* release;
* rule.

Distribution analysis can reveal systemic weaknesses.

---

## Pareto Analysis

The framework may identify whether a small number of root causes produce most defects.

Example:

```text id="wn7jpx"
Missing Contract Tests
      ↓
Large Share of Integration Defects
```

This can guide quality investment.

---

## Quality Debt Portfolio

Quality debt should be managed as a portfolio rather than a simple backlog.

The portfolio may contain:

```text id="0jmwnv"
High-Risk Debt
High-Interest Debt
Strategic Debt
Legacy Debt
Automation Debt
Low-Priority Debt
```

Different categories may require different remediation strategies.

---

## Strategic Debt

Some debt may block future architectural goals.

Examples include:

* legacy plugin APIs;
* outdated persistence abstractions;
* old configuration systems.

Strategic debt should be evaluated relative to the roadmap.

---

## Release-Blocking Defects

Certain defects must block release.

Examples may include:

* Critical security defects;
* failed required correctness tests;
* data corruption risk;
* invalid release artifacts.

Blocking behavior must be defined by Quality Gates and profiles.

---

## Non-Blocking Defects

Non-blocking defects may remain open across a release when risk is acceptable.

Their existence must still be visible.

Release notes or risk reports may need to reference significant known limitations.

---

## Known Issues

A release may intentionally contain known non-blocking issues.

Known issues should be:

* documented;
* owned;
* risk-assessed;
* traceable to defects.

Known issues must not become an informal substitute for defect management.

---

## Release Debt

A release may carry approved quality debt.

Release debt should be explicit.

Conceptually:

```text id="juxrmb"
Release
      ↓
Known Debt
      ↓
Accepted Residual Risk
```

Subsequent releases should not automatically inherit acceptance without review.

---

## Debt Carry-Forward

When debt remains unresolved across releases, carry-forward should preserve:

* ownership;
* risk;
* age;
* rationale;
* remediation plan.

The debt should not be recreated as a new item every release.

---

## Exception-Generated Debt

Temporary exceptions frequently create quality debt.

Example:

```text id="wwt0gk"
Quality Rule Failure
      ↓
Approved Exception
      ↓
Temporary Debt
```

When appropriate, the exception should automatically link to a debt record.

---

## Exception Expiration

When an exception expires, associated debt must be reassessed.

Possible outcomes include:

```text id="2gtvud"
Remediated
Exception Renewed
Gate Blocked
Risk Escalated
```

Silent expiration is not acceptable.

---

## Accepted Risk Debt

A defect under accepted risk remains known quality debt unless the condition is no longer considered a deficiency.

Risk acceptance does not erase the debt.

---

## Security Debt Governance

Security debt requires stronger controls.

High or Critical security debt should normally require:

* explicit risk acceptance;
* mitigation;
* review;
* expiration;
* release visibility.

Permanent acceptance should be exceptional.

---

## Architecture Debt Governance

Architecture debt should be evaluated for compounding cost.

Repeated violations of the same architectural rule may indicate that:

* the architecture is unrealistic;
* the rule is inadequate;
* enforcement is too weak;
* remediation is incomplete.

The response should address the systemic cause.

---

## Testing Debt Governance

Testing debt may receive higher priority when it affects:

* critical capabilities;
* frequently changed code;
* unstable integrations;
* previous defect areas.

Coverage numbers alone should not determine testing debt importance.

---

## Documentation Debt Governance

Documentation debt should be prioritized according to its impact on:

* implementation;
* release;
* operation;
* onboarding;
* architecture understanding.

Public or normative documentation generally requires stronger control.

---

## Quality Infrastructure Defects

Defects in the quality system are particularly important.

Examples include:

```text id="flye7i"
Quality Check Reports PASS Incorrectly
Gate Ignores Failed Evidence
Severity Mapping Incorrect
Evidence Parser Loses Findings
```

Such defects can create false confidence across the entire platform.

---

## Quality Infrastructure Debt

Quality infrastructure may also accumulate debt.

Examples include:

* slow checks;
* legacy scripts;
* duplicated validation;
* unreliable adapters;
* missing test coverage.

Because the quality system governs other engineering decisions, its debt deserves explicit management.

---

## Flaky Tests as Debt

Persistent flaky tests should be treated as Quality Debt.

They reduce:

* verification trust;
* CI stability;
* developer confidence.

Flaky tests should not be normalized as routine noise.

---

## Suppressions as Debt Signals

Repeated suppressions may indicate debt.

Example:

```text id="jmkyjb"
Rule X
      ↓
Many Local Suppressions
      ↓
Potential Quality Debt
```

The system should determine whether the problem lies in:

* the code;
* the rule;
* the migration state.

---

## Manual Checks as Debt Signals

A manual quality process may be acceptable initially.

However, repeated manual verification suitable for automation should be tracked as Automation Debt.

This creates a path toward scalable quality engineering.

---

## Defect Review

Significant open defects should be reviewed periodically.

Review should verify:

```text id="y878ji"
Severity still correct?

Priority still correct?

Owner active?

Risk changed?

Release impact changed?

Remediation still valid?
```

---

## Debt Review

Debt reviews should focus on:

* risk;
* age;
* interest;
* strategic impact;
* remediation progress;
* continued relevance.

Debt that is never reviewed becomes unmanaged debt.

---

## Quality Debt Review Cadence

Review frequency should reflect risk.

For example:

```text id="zbb3p2"
Critical Debt
      → continuous attention

High-Risk Debt
      → frequent review

Low-Risk Debt
      → periodic review
```

Exact cadence belongs to governance policy.

---

## Defect Escalation

Defects should escalate when:

* severity increases;
* impact expands;
* remediation repeatedly fails;
* release deadlines approach;
* recurrence occurs;
* associated risk increases.

Escalation should remain explicit.

---

## Debt Escalation

Debt may escalate when:

* interest increases;
* dependencies accumulate;
* roadmap impact grows;
* exceptions expire;
* associated incidents occur.

A previously low-priority debt item may become strategically critical.

---

## Defect SLA

The framework may eventually define target remediation expectations by severity.

Conceptually:

```text id="wwjiyt"
CRITICAL
      → immediate attention

HIGH
      → urgent remediation

MEDIUM
      → planned remediation

LOW
      → managed backlog
```

Specific durations should be defined by governance rather than hard-coded universally.

---

## Debt Remediation Objectives

Debt reduction objectives may be defined by:

* domain;
* release;
* milestone;
* architecture phase;
* risk category.

Example:

```text id="66zuh4"
Objective:
No new architecture debt in v5.

Objective:
Reduce legacy architecture debt by 30%.
```

Targets must remain meaningful.

---

## Debt Budget

A future governance model may define a Quality Debt Budget.

The purpose would not be to encourage debt.

It would establish explicit tolerance for known deficiencies.

Example:

```text id="6fby4i"
No Critical Debt
Maximum 3 High-Risk Debt Items
```

Any budget must remain risk-aware.

---

## Debt Budget Anti-Pattern

A debt budget must not become permission to intentionally create problems simply because capacity remains.

Quality decisions should still seek the best engineering outcome.

---

## Remediation Verification Gate

Major debt remediation may require a dedicated verification step.

Conceptually:

```text id="6bekvz"
Debt Remediation
      ↓
Quality Verification
      ↓
Debt Closure
```

This prevents premature closure.

---

## Defect and CI Integration

CI may automatically:

* detect findings;
* reopen regressions;
* attach evidence;
* validate remediation;
* block gates.

The defect tracker should not duplicate every transient CI failure.

Only meaningful managed defects should persist.

---

## Defect and Release Integration

Release validation should consider:

* open Critical defects;
* open High defects;
* accepted defects;
* related risks;
* unresolved debt;
* expired exceptions.

Release gates determine whether these conditions permit progression.

---

## Defect and Documentation Integration

Significant known limitations should be reflected in appropriate documentation.

Documentation may include:

* known issues;
* migration guidance;
* temporary constraints;
* operational limitations.

The defect tracker remains the authoritative lifecycle record.

---

## Defect and Governance Integration

Governance should define:

* triage authority;
* severity policy;
* closure expectations;
* acceptance rules;
* escalation;
* reporting.

Without governance, defect state can become inconsistent.

---

## Defect Auditability

A defect record should allow reconstruction of:

```text id="ni42nf"
How was the defect discovered?

Which evidence supported it?

What risk was identified?

Who owned it?

How was it corrected?

How was closure verified?
```

---

## Debt Auditability

A debt record should answer:

```text id="60vibq"
Why was this deficiency accepted?

What risk existed?

Who approved deferral?

How long did it remain?

How was it eventually resolved?
```

---

## Defect Reporting

Quality reports may include:

```text id="f2h816"
Open Defects
Critical Defects
High Defects
New Defects
Resolved Defects
Recurring Defects
```

The report should emphasize risk rather than raw count alone.

---

## Debt Reporting

Quality debt reports may include:

```text id="d2mx7j"
Total Debt
High-Risk Debt
Debt by Domain
Debt Age
Debt Trend
Debt Added
Debt Resolved
```

---

## Domain Debt Report

Example:

```text id="ks664s"
Architecture      12
Testing            8
Documentation      5
Security           1
Automation          7
```

Counts should be supplemented with risk information.

---

## Risk-Based Debt Report

Example:

```text id="qshrv6"
Critical Debt: 0
High Debt:     3
Medium Debt:  11
Low Debt:     18
```

This provides more decision value than total count alone.

---

## Release Defect Report

A release report may include:

```text id="4h8yzu"
Blocking Defects: 0
Accepted High Defects: 1
Known Medium Defects: 4
Quality Debt Carried Forward: 7
```

Significant accepted risks should be traceable.

---

## Defect Trend Analysis

Historical defect trends may reveal:

* improving correctness;
* repeated regression;
* weak test strategy;
* architecture instability.

Example:

```text id="io18ar"
Post-Release Defects

v1 → 12
v2 → 8
v3 → 4
```

Trend interpretation should consider release scope.

---

## Debt Trend Analysis

Debt trends may reveal whether engineering practices are sustainable.

A healthy long-term direction is generally:

```text id="g8pvf2"
New Debt Creation
      <
Debt Remediation
```

unless the platform is undergoing a known expansion or migration.

---

## Root Cause Trend

Root cause analysis may reveal recurring categories.

Example:

```text id="u657io"
40% of recent defects
      ↓
Missing Integration Validation
```

This may justify investment in stronger integration testing.

---

## Defect Learning Loop

The desired systemic loop is:

```text id="zpqypb"
Defect
  ↓
Triage
  ↓
Correction
  ↓
Root Cause
  ↓
Preventive Action
  ↓
Quality Framework Improvement
```

The goal is continuous reduction of recurring defect classes.

---

## Debt Learning Loop

Quality debt should also generate learning.

```text id="vtw05x"
Debt Accumulation
      ↓
Analyze Cause
      ↓
Improve Architecture / Process / Tooling
      ↓
Reduce Future Debt Creation
```

Debt management should not consist only of cleanup.

---

## Preventing Defect Normalization

Repeated exposure to the same warnings can create normalization.

Examples include:

```text id="0ce8uh"
Known Flaky Test
Ignored Warning
Repeated Build Failure
```

The framework must prevent permanent tolerance of recurring defects without explicit governance.

---

## Preventing Debt Normalization

The phrase:

```text id="n4rucf"
It has always been like that.
```

must not be sufficient justification for ongoing debt.

Legacy status is context, not quality approval.

---

## No Zero-Defect Dogma

The framework does not require theoretical elimination of every defect.

Absolute zero-defect requirements may create disproportionate engineering cost.

The objective is:

```text id="zgbxpf"
No Unmanaged Defects
No Invisible High-Risk Debt
Continuous Reduction of Significant Quality Debt
```

This is more practical and sustainable.

---

## Defect Cost

The cost of defects increases when detection occurs later.

Conceptually:

```text id="v032h8"
Design
  ↓
Implementation
  ↓
CI
  ↓
Release
  ↓
Production

Later Detection
      →
Higher Cost
```

This reinforces early quality feedback.

---

## Debt Cost

Debt creates both direct and indirect cost.

Direct cost includes remediation.

Indirect cost may include:

* slower development;
* increased review complexity;
* repeated workarounds;
* more defects;
* reduced developer confidence.

These effects justify active debt management.

---

## Debt Prioritization Matrix

A conceptual matrix may combine Risk and Interest.

```text id="pdnsdi"
                 Debt Interest

Risk          Low        High

Low           Backlog    Planned

High          Priority   Immediate
```

This is only a conceptual aid.

Final priority should remain context-aware.

---

## Debt Dependency Graph

Some debt items depend on others.

Example:

```text id="9y0r27"
Architecture Refactor
      ↓
Enables
      ↓
Legacy API Removal
      ↓
Enables
      ↓
Compatibility Shim Removal
```

Large remediation initiatives may require explicit dependency mapping.

---

## Debt Clusters

Related debt may be grouped into clusters.

Examples:

```text id="at9x7c"
Legacy Plugin Architecture Debt
Testing Infrastructure Debt
Documentation Migration Debt
```

Clusters enable strategic remediation rather than isolated fixes.

---

## Quality Debt Epic

Large debt clusters may justify dedicated engineering EPICs.

Example:

```text id="m6re4a"
Quality Debt Cluster
      ↓
Dedicated Remediation EPIC
      ↓
Milestones
      ↓
Verification
```

This prevents strategic debt from disappearing inside small backlog items.

---

## Defect Automation

Automation may assist with:

* defect creation;
* deduplication;
* evidence attachment;
* status verification;
* regression detection;
* aging alerts.

Automation must preserve human review for contextual decisions.

---

## Debt Automation

Automation may identify candidate debt from:

* persistent findings;
* repeated suppressions;
* expired exceptions;
* manual checks;
* old dependencies.

Candidate debt should be reviewed before authoritative registration where context is required.

---

## AI-Assisted Defect Analysis

AI may assist with:

* defect summarization;
* root cause hypothesis;
* duplicate detection;
* remediation suggestions;
* pattern identification.

AI must not silently close defects or accept risk.

---

## AI-Assisted Debt Analysis

AI may assist with:

* clustering debt;
* identifying high-interest areas;
* analyzing recurring causes;
* proposing remediation sequencing.

Authoritative priority and governance decisions remain human-controlled.

---

## Defect Data Integrity

Defect records influence quality and release decisions.

Unauthorized or silent modification must be prevented.

Critical changes should remain traceable.

Examples include:

* severity changes;
* status changes;
* closure;
* risk acceptance.

---

## Debt Data Integrity

Debt history should preserve:

* creation;
* ownership changes;
* risk changes;
* remediation decisions;
* closure.

This protects long-term engineering knowledge.

---

## Defect Retention

Closed defect records may remain valuable for:

* regression analysis;
* root cause trends;
* rule evolution;
* release history.

Retention policy should reflect analytical value.

---

## Debt Retention

Closed debt records may help explain architectural history and framework evolution.

Important debt history should therefore not be destroyed immediately after remediation.

---

## Defect Confidentiality

Some defects may contain sensitive information.

Examples include:

* security vulnerabilities;
* credentials exposure;
* infrastructure weaknesses.

Access control should reflect sensitivity.

---

## Initial Defect Model

An initial FamilyOS implementation may begin with:

```text id="fqo55h"
id
domain
target
severity
priority
status
owner
evidence
description
```

This is sufficient for basic lifecycle management.

---

## Initial Quality Debt Model

An initial debt record may contain:

```text id="nuk5bu"
id
domain
target
risk
owner
status
reason
remediation_plan
```

The model can evolve as governance maturity increases.

---

## Initial Workflow

A practical initial workflow is:

```text id="5w0du0"

       Planned Remediation
            ↓
       Verification
            ↓
          Close
```

---

## Reference Defect Flow

The complete defect lifecycle can be represented as:

```text id="2owm99"
Evidence / Incident / Review
          ↓
       Finding
          ↓
        Triage
          ↓

       │     ↓
       │   Verify
       │     ↓

             ↓
          Verify
             ↓
           Close
             ↓
          Learning
```

---

## Strategic Outcome

Defect and Quality Debt Management enables FamilyOS to move from:

```text id="qkh56z"
We know there are some problems,
but we will fix them later.
```

toward:

```text id="6jp63q"
The deficiency is identified.

Its risk is understood.

Its owner is known.

Its remediation is planned.

Its status is visible.

Its resolution requires evidence.
```

This distinction is essential for sustainable platform evolution.

---

## Final Defect and Debt Principle

FamilyOS does not need to eliminate every imperfection immediately.

It must ensure that meaningful deficiencies are never invisible, unmanaged, or indefinitely deferred without explicit engineering justification.

The Defect and Quality Debt Management model therefore establishes a controlled relationship between:

```text id="45d6bt"
Quality Deficiency
      ↓
Evidence
      ↓
Defect
      ↓
Risk
      ↓
Remediation or Debt
      ↓
Verification
      ↓
Learning
```

Through explicit identification, ownership, prioritization, baselining, remediation, verification, risk integration, trend analysis, and continuous learning, FamilyOS can prevent defects and quality debt from silently eroding the reliability, maintainability, architecture, security, and long-term sustainability of the platform.
