## Purpose

This document records the actual validation state and evidence for **EPIC-QLT-001 — Quality Framework**.

It exists to determine whether the current Quality Framework documentation and repository state remain:

* structurally complete;
* internally coherent;
* consistent with the canonical machine-readable contract;
* synchronized across control documents;
* compatible with the current FamilyOS repository;
* supported by actual validation evidence.

This document records validation results.

It does not define the complete validation architecture of the Quality Framework.

Framework-level validation principles and expectations are defined in:

```text
22-Validation.md
```

---

## Validation Principle

Only evidence from actual execution, inspection, or governed review SHALL be used to convert a validation requirement into `PASS`.

The governing rule is:

```text
Required Check
      ↓
Actual Execution / Review
      ↓
Evidence
      ↓
Result
```

A required check SHALL remain `PENDING` when acceptable evidence does not yet exist.

---

## Historical Publication Context

EPIC-QLT-001 version `1.0.0` was historically completed and published under:

```text
v4.6.0-quality-framework
```

The historical tag resolves to the repository state associated with the original Quality Framework completion.

That historical publication is immutable.

The current revalidation does not:

* move the historical tag;
* recreate the historical tag;
* alter the historical release commit;
* reinterpret the historical tag as the current repository state.

Post-publication normalization is recorded through later repository commits.

---

## Historical Publication State

```text
Framework Version:      1.0.0
Historical Publication: Published
Historical Tag:         v4.6.0-quality-framework
Historical Tag Policy:  Immutable
```

The historical publication and the current revalidation are separate events.

---

## Canonical Structure

The current canonical Quality Framework structure is:

```text
Numbered Documents: 26
Canonical Range:     00 → 25
Control Documents:   7
Canonical Files:    33
```

The canonical relationship is:

```text
26 + 7 = 33
```

---

## Numbered Document Inventory

The canonical numbered documents are:

```text
00-EPIC.md
01-Context.md
02-Vision.md
03-Quality-Principles.md
04-Quality-Architecture.md
05-Quality-Domains.md
06-Quality-Rule-Model.md
07-Quality-Profiles.md
08-Quality-Metrics.md
09-Quality-Evidence.md
10-Quality-Risk-Management.md
11-Defect-and-Quality-Debt-Management.md
12-Quality-Reviews-and-Assessments.md
13-Quality-Automation.md
14-Quality-Observability.md
15-Quality-Gates.md
16-Quality-Compliance.md
17-Continuous-Improvement.md
18-Quality-Governance.md
19-Framework-Lifecycle.md
20-Roadmap.md
21-References.md
22-Validation.md
23-Summary.md
24-Release.md
25-Implementation-Checklist.md
```

Result:

```text
26 / 26 present
PASS
```

---

## Control Document Inventory

The canonical control documents are:

```text
EPIC-QLT-001.md
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

Result:

```text
7 / 7 present
PASS
```

---

## Canonical File Inventory

Expected canonical files:

```text
33
```

Current canonical files:

```text
33
```

Missing canonical files:

```text
0
```

Unexpected canonical files:

```text
0
```

Result:

```text
PASS
```

---

## Empty File Validation

Required canonical documents were checked for unintended empty files.

Expected result:

```text
No canonical files returned
```

Observed result:

```text
No empty canonical files detected
```

Result:

```text
PASS
```

---

## Numbering Integrity

The canonical sequence is required to remain continuous from:

```text
00
```

through:

```text
25
```

Current result:

```text
26 numbered documents
No missing numbers
No duplicate numbers
```

Result:

```text
PASS
```

---

## EPIC.yaml Validation

`EPIC.yaml` was previously not parseable as a single valid YAML document.

The file has been normalized into a dedicated machine-readable contract.

Current contract identity:

```yaml
id: EPIC-QLT-001
title: Quality Framework
version: 1.0.0
status: completed
```

Current canonical structure:

```yaml
structure:
  numbered_documents: 26
  canonical_document_range: "00-25"
  control_documents: 7
  canonical_files: 33
```

Current declared deliverables:

```text
33
```

Current filesystem files:

```text
33
```

Relationship:

```text
EPIC.yaml deliverables
        =
Filesystem canonical files
        =
33
```

YAML parse result:

```text
PASS
```

Contract result:

```text
PASS
```

---

## MANIFEST.md Validation

`MANIFEST.md` defines the authoritative human-readable structural inventory.

The current manifest records:

```text
26 numbered documents
7 control documents
33 canonical files
```

Current manifest status:

```text
Completed
```

The manifest and `EPIC.yaml` agree on:

* EPIC identity;
* version;
* canonical numbered range;
* numbered-document count;
* control-document count;
* canonical-file count.

Result:

```text
PASS
```

---

## EPIC-QLT-001.md Validation

`EPIC-QLT-001.md` records the completed Quality Framework state.

Current state:

```text
Version:               1.0.0
Status:                Completed
Numbered Documents:    26
Control Documents:     7
Canonical Files:       33
Historical Publication: Published
Historical Tag:        v4.6.0-quality-framework
```

The document distinguishes historical publication from current post-publication revalidation.

Result:

```text
PASS
```

---

## Revision-History.md Validation

`Revision-History.md` preserves the Quality Framework's historical and post-publication evolution.

The revision history records:

* version `1.0.0`;
* completed framework status;
* canonical `26 + 7 = 33` structure;
* historical publication under `v4.6.0-quality-framework`;
* historical tag immutability;
* post-publication normalization;
* current revalidation evidence.

Result:

```text
PASS
```

---

## README.md Validation

`README.md` provides the human-readable entry point to the Quality Framework.

The README identifies:

```text
26 canonical numbered documents
7 control documents
33 canonical EPIC files
```

Its documented structure is consistent with the canonical manifest.

Result:

```text
PASS
```

---

## CHANGELOG.md Validation

`CHANGELOG.md` records significant Quality Framework changes.

The historical version `1.0.0` baseline and Quality Framework completion remain part of the repository history.

Post-publication control-document normalization does not rewrite the historical release.

Result:

```text
PASS
```

---

## Control Document Synchronization

Current control-document synchronization state:

| Document              | State          |
| --------------------- | -------------- |
| `EPIC-QLT-001.md`     | ✅ Synchronized |
| `EPIC.yaml`           | ✅ Synchronized |
| `README.md`           | ✅ Synchronized |
| `MANIFEST.md`         | ✅ Synchronized |
| `CHANGELOG.md`        | ✅ Synchronized |
| `VALIDATION.md`       | ✅ Synchronized |
| `Revision-History.md` | ✅ Synchronized |

Overall result:

```text
PASS
```

## Semantic Consistency

The Quality Framework defines a coherent progression from engineering expectations to governed quality decisions.

The core semantic model is:

```text
Quality Expectations
        ↓
Quality Rules
        ↓
Quality Profiles
        ↓
Verification
        ↓
Quality Evidence
        ↓
Quality Findings
        ↓
Quality Assessment
        ↓
Quality Gates
        ↓
Governed Decisions
        ↓
Continuous Improvement
```

The reviewed framework maintains consistent terminology across:

* Quality Domains;
* Quality Rules;
* Quality Profiles;
* Quality Metrics;
* Quality Evidence;
* Quality Findings;
* Quality Assessments;
* Quality Risk;
* Defects;
* Quality Debt;
* Quality Gates;
* Quality Compliance;
* Quality Governance.

Result:

```text
PASS
```

---

## Framework Boundary Validation

The Quality Framework coordinates engineering quality but does not replace specialized FamilyOS frameworks.

Validated ownership boundaries include:

```text
Testing
    → Testing Framework

Documentation
    → Documentation Framework

Build
    → Build Framework

Release
    → Release Framework

Plugin Compliance
    → Plugin Compliance Framework

Quality Semantics / Evidence / Assessment / Gates
    → Quality Framework
```

No unresolved ownership collision has been identified during current revalidation.

Result:

```text
PASS
```

---

## Governance Consistency

The framework consistently requires explicit governance for:

* Quality Rules;
* Quality Profiles;
* Quality Gates;
* Quality Exceptions;
* Quality Risk;
* compliance;
* framework evolution;
* lifecycle transitions;
* risk acceptance.

Authoritative decisions remain traceable to explicit ownership and evidence.

Result:

```text
PASS
```

---

## Reference Integrity

Internal document references are expected to correspond to canonical Quality Framework files or governed external FamilyOS framework references.

The canonical structural references have been reviewed against the current repository inventory.

No blocking missing canonical reference has been identified during current revalidation.

Result:

```text
PASS
```

---

## Placeholder Review

The Quality Framework was checked for unresolved blocking placeholder tokens.

No unresolved blocking placeholder condition was identified during the current Quality Framework audit.

Statements that document placeholder-validation concepts are not themselves unresolved placeholders.

Result:

```text
PASS
```

---

## Current Repository Validation

The current repository quality gates were executed during this revalidation.

Current repository branch:

```text
feature/foundation-engineering-docs
```

Revalidation date:

```text
2026-08-11
```

---

```bash
ruff check .
```

Actual result:

```text
All checks passed!
```

Exit code:

```text
0
```

Result:

```text

```

---

## MyPy Validation

Command:

```bash
mypy src
```

Actual result:

```text
Success: no issues found in 527 source files
```

Exit code:

```text
0
```

Result:

```text
PASS
```

---

## Pytest Validation

Command:

```bash
pytest -q
```

Actual result:

```text
1243 passed
```

Observed execution time during the recorded run:

```text
1.00s
```

Execution duration is informational and may differ between runs.

Exit code:

```text
0
```

Result:

```text
PASS
```

---

## Repository Diff Validation

Command:

```bash
git diff --check
```

Actual result:

```text
No output
```

Interpretation:

```text
No whitespace errors detected
```

Result:

```text
PASS
```

---

## Current Repository Quality Summary

```text
Ruff:      PASS
MyPy:      PASS — 527 source files
Pytest:    PASS — 1243 tests
DiffCheck: PASS
```

---

## Historical vs Current Evidence

Historical publication and current revalidation evidence SHALL remain separate.

### Historical Publication

```text
Framework Version:
1.0.0

Historical Tag:
v4.6.0-quality-framework

Historical State:
Published
```

Historical evidence belongs to the repository revision represented by the historical tag.

---

### Current Revalidation

```text
Date:
2026-08-11

Ruff:
PASS

MyPy:
PASS — 527 source files

Pytest:
PASS — 1243 tests

DiffCheck:
PASS
```

Current evidence belongs to the repository state against which these commands were executed.

---

## Validation Evidence Integrity

Validation evidence is revision-aware.

The governing principle is:

```text
Evidence
    +
Repository Revision
    =
Validation Claim
```

Evidence from one repository revision SHALL NOT automatically be treated as proof for another revision when relevant changes have occurred.

Required checks must be rerun when changes invalidate previous evidence.

---

---

## Machine-Readable Baseline Alignment

Following successful revalidation, the expected `EPIC.yaml` baseline state is:

```yaml
baseline:
  framework_version: 1.0.0
  documentation_status: completed
  repository_validation_status: validated
  final_validation_status: validated
```

Historical release metadata remains:

```yaml
release:
  historical_tag: v4.6.0-quality-framework
  publication_status: published
  historical_tag_immutable: true
```

---

## Historical Tag Integrity

The historical Quality Framework publication tag is:

```text
v4.6.0-quality-framework
```

This tag SHALL remain unchanged.

Post-publication revalidation SHALL be represented through ordinary repository history.

No historical tag rewrite is required or permitted by this validation.

---

## Final Validation Decision

The current Quality Framework baseline satisfies the revalidation requirements documented in this validation record.

Final current state:

```text
EPIC:                   EPIC-QLT-001
Framework:              Quality Framework
Version:                1.0.0

Repository Validation:  VALIDATED
Final Validation:       VALIDATED
```

---

## Final Validation Result

```text
PASS
```

---

## Final Principle

The Quality Framework validation record SHALL remain grounded in actual evidence.

The governing principle is:

> Define the canonical baseline, verify the repository, preserve historical publication integrity, record current evidence, and only then declare the framework validated.

EPIC-QLT-001 satisfies this principle.
