## Purpose

This manifest defines the authoritative document inventory and structural contract of EPIC-QLT-001 — Quality Framework.

It ensures that the Quality Framework remains complete, traceable, internally consistent, version-controlled, and synchronized with its canonical documentation structure.

The manifest establishes:

* the canonical numbered document sequence;
* the control document inventory;
* document responsibilities;
* structural completeness requirements;
* synchronization requirements;
* normative hierarchy;
* framework relationships;
* change-control expectations.

The manifest SHALL remain synchronized with the physical repository structure.

---

## Canonical Structure

EPIC-QLT-001 contains two document classes:

```text
Numbered Framework Documents
        +
Control Documents
```

The numbered framework documentation consists of exactly:

```text
00 → 25
```

representing **26 canonical numbered documents**.

The EPIC additionally contains **7 control documents**.

Therefore, the canonical EPIC inventory consists of:

```text
26 numbered documents
+
7 control documents
=
33 canonical files
```

```text
Exactly 26 numbered documents
Sequential numbering from 00 through 25
Exactly one document for each number
No duplicate document numbers

```

This sequence is authoritative for EPIC-QLT-001 version 1.0.0.

---

## Document Responsibility Model

The documentation is organized into several conceptual layers.

### Foundation

```text
00 EPIC
01 Context
02 Vision
03 Quality Principles
```

These documents explain why the framework exists and establish its foundational direction.

---

### Quality Architecture and Model

```text
04 Quality Architecture
05 Quality Domains
06 Quality Rule Model
07 Quality Profiles
```

These documents define how quality concepts are organized and represented.

---

### Measurement and Evidence

```text
08 Quality Metrics

```

These documents define how quality state becomes measurable, observable, and supportable by evidence.

---

### Risk and Quality State Management

```text
10 Quality Risk Management
11 Defect and Quality Debt Management
12 Quality Reviews and Assessments
```

These documents define how quality problems, risks, deficiencies, and target-level quality state are managed.

---

### Automation and Enforcement

```text
13 Quality Automation

```

These documents define how quality evaluation becomes automated, observable, enforceable, and compliance-aware.

---

### Improvement and Governance

```text
17 Continuous Improvement
18 Quality Governance
19 Framework Lifecycle
```

These documents define how quality improves, how authority is exercised, and how the framework itself evolves.

---

### Evolution and Closure

```text
20 Roadmap
21 References
22 Validation
23 Summary
24 Release
25 Implementation Checklist
```

These documents define future evolution, dependencies, validation, consolidation, release, and implementation progression.

---

## Normative Hierarchy

The Quality Framework documentation follows this general authority hierarchy:

```text
FamilyOS Engineering Constitution
        ↓
Authoritative Architecture Decisions
        ↓
FamilyOS Engineering Frameworks
        ↓
EPIC-QLT-001 Quality Framework
        ↓
Quality Requirements / Rules / Profiles
        ↓
Quality Automation and Gates
        ↓
Quality Evidence and Assessments
```

Higher-authority FamilyOS architecture and governance artifacts take precedence when conflicts exist.

EPIC-QLT-001 SHALL not silently redefine responsibilities owned by another authoritative framework.

---

## Framework Relationships

The Quality Framework operates in coordination with other FamilyOS engineering frameworks.

### Engineering Foundation

`EPIC-ENG-001 — Engineering Foundation`

Provides the engineering principles, architecture expectations, development foundations, and governance context upon which the Quality Framework builds.

---

### Testing Framework

`EPIC-TST-001 — Testing Framework`

Defines authoritative testing practices and test execution semantics.

The Quality Framework may consume test results as Quality Evidence but SHALL not replace the Testing Framework.

---

### Documentation Framework

`EPIC-DOC-001 — Documentation Framework`

Defines authoritative documentation standards, lifecycle, metadata, validation, quality, and governance practices.

The Quality Framework may evaluate documentation quality using those authoritative requirements.

---

### Build Framework

`EPIC-BLD-001 — Build Framework`

Provides build execution and build evidence that may participate in quality assessments and release gates.

---

### Release Framework

`EPIC-REL-001 — Release Framework`

Consumes quality state and quality gate decisions as part of release readiness.

The Quality Framework does not replace release governance.

---

### Plugin Compliance Framework

`EPIC-PLUGIN-002 — Plugin Compliance Framework`

Defines authoritative plugin compliance rules, profiles, evidence, findings, and governance.

The Quality Framework may consume plugin compliance results but SHALL not duplicate the plugin compliance engine.

---

## Synchronization Requirements

The following files SHALL remain synchronized with this manifest:

```text
00-EPIC.md
EPIC-QLT-001.md
EPIC.yaml
README.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

Synchronization includes, where applicable:

* EPIC identifier;
* title;
* version;
* status;
* ownership;
* canonical document inventory;
* dependencies;
* framework relationships;
* validation state;
* release state.

---

## Completeness Requirements

EPIC-QLT-001 is structurally complete only when:

```text
[ ] All documents 00 through 25 exist
[ ] Every number occurs exactly once
[ ] No required document is empty
[ ] File names match their canonical responsibilities
[ ] EPIC.yaml lists the canonical deliverables
[ ] README.md describes the canonical framework
[ ] MANIFEST.md matches the physical repository
[ ] CHANGELOG.md reflects significant changes
[ ] VALIDATION.md reflects actual validation state
[ ] Revision-History.md reflects published revisions
[ ] EPIC-QLT-001.md remains synchronized
```

---

## Change Control

Changes to the canonical inventory require deliberate review.

A structural change may include:

* adding a numbered document;
* removing a numbered document;
* renaming a canonical document;
* changing document responsibility;
* changing control document requirements;
* modifying the normative hierarchy.

Such changes SHALL:

1. preserve repository integrity;
2. update this manifest;
3. update `EPIC.yaml`;
4. update affected navigation documentation;
5. update revision or change history when appropriate;
6. validate internal references;
7. preserve traceability.

---

## Document Addition Policy

New numbered documents SHOULD NOT be added casually.

Before extending the `00 → 25` sequence, maintainers should determine whether the proposed material:

* belongs inside an existing document;
* belongs to another FamilyOS framework;
* requires a separate specification;
* requires an RFC or ADR;
* represents implementation documentation rather than normative Quality Framework documentation.

This protects the framework from unnecessary fragmentation.

---

## Document Removal Policy

A canonical document SHALL NOT simply disappear.

Removal requires:

```text
Governance Decision
      ↓
Impact Analysis
      ↓
Reference Migration
      ↓
Manifest Update
      ↓
Revision Record
```

Where historical traceability is required, deprecation is preferred over silent deletion.

---

## Naming Requirements

Canonical numbered files use:

```text
NN-Descriptive-Name.md
```

where:

```text
NN
```

is the two-digit canonical sequence number.

Control files use their established FamilyOS names and are not part of numbered sequencing.

---

## Language Requirement

The normative Quality Framework documentation is written in English.

Technical identifiers, commands, source code, and externally defined names retain their canonical representation.

---

## Validation Responsibility

Structural validation should verify at minimum:

```text
Document count
Sequential numbering
Duplicate numbers
Empty files
Canonical file names
Control document presence
Manifest synchronization
EPIC.yaml synchronization
```

Semantic validation should additionally evaluate:

```text
Terminology consistency
Cross-document consistency
Framework boundary consistency
Dependency consistency
Governance consistency
Lifecycle consistency
```

---

## Repository Integrity

The Quality Framework documentation SHALL remain suitable for version-controlled engineering governance.

Repository integrity requires:

* deterministic file organization;
* explicit structural changes;
* reviewable diffs;
* no accidental duplicate documents;
* no unexplained temporary artifacts;
* no empty canonical files;
* no stale control inventory.

---

## Manifest Authority

This manifest is the authoritative structural inventory for EPIC-QLT-001 version 1.0.0.

`EPIC.yaml` provides the machine-readable representation of the EPIC.

`MANIFEST.md` provides the human-readable structural contract.

When the physical repository and these control artifacts disagree, the discrepancy must be investigated and resolved before the framework is considered structurally validated.

---

## Final Compliance

EPIC-QLT-001 conforms to this manifest when:

```text
Physical Repository
        =
Canonical Numbered Inventory
        +
Canonical Control Inventory
```

and:

```text
EPIC.yaml
        =
MANIFEST.md
        =
Repository Structure
```

with respect to their shared structural responsibilities.

The manifest SHALL evolve together with the Quality Framework and SHALL remain synchronized throughout its lifecycle.
