## [1.0.0] — Draft

### Added

#### Quality Framework Foundation

Established EPIC-QLT-001 as the authoritative Quality Framework for the FamilyOS engineering ecosystem.

Defined the framework's:

* purpose;
* scope;
* vision;
* quality principles;
* architecture;
* quality model;
* governance responsibilities;
* lifecycle;
* implementation strategy.

#### Quality Domains

Introduced the canonical Quality Domain model for organizing quality requirements, rules, evidence, assessments, metrics, risks, and governance.

Initial domains include:

* architecture;
* source code;
* static analysis;
* typing;
* testing;
* documentation;
* dependencies;
* build;
* release;
* security;
* plugins;
* compliance;
* governance.

#### Quality Rule Model

Defined the conceptual model for Quality Rules, including:

* identity;
* applicability;
* severity;
* execution semantics;
* evidence expectations;
* ownership;
* lifecycle;
* governance.

#### Quality Profiles

Introduced reusable Quality Profiles for defining which quality expectations apply to different engineering targets.

#### Quality Metrics

Defined principles for quality measurement, interpretation, aggregation, governance, and responsible use.

#### Quality Evidence

Introduced Quality Evidence as a first-class framework concept.

Established evidence expectations around:

* structure;
* reproducibility;
* traceability;
* revision awareness;
* machine readability;
* attribution.

#### Quality Risk Management

Defined a lifecycle for identifying, evaluating, owning, mitigating, monitoring, escalating, accepting, and closing Quality Risks.

#### Defect and Quality Debt Management

Established distinct models for:

* defects;
* quality debt;
* ownership;
* prioritization;
* remediation;
* acceptance;
* lifecycle tracking.

#### Quality Reviews and Assessments

Defined formal Quality Review and Quality Assessment concepts for consolidating evidence, findings, risks, and applicable quality expectations.

#### Quality Automation

Defined automation architecture and principles for deterministic quality verification.

Established initial integration direction for:

* Ruff;
* MyPy;
* Pytest.

Defined local and CI consistency as a core automation requirement.

#### Quality Observability

Defined principles for observing:

* quality state;
* assessments;
* findings;
* gate outcomes;
* execution failures;
* quality trends;
* recurring engineering problems.

#### Quality Gates

Introduced Quality Gates as governed engineering decision mechanisms.

Defined progressive enforcement stages:

```text
Observation
    ↓
Non-Blocking
    ↓
Blocking
```

#### Quality Compliance

Defined quality compliance semantics based on explicit requirements, rules, evidence, findings, and compliance results.

Established governed exception requirements.

#### Continuous Improvement

Defined the feedback model through which quality evidence and recurring problems can produce systemic engineering improvements.

#### Quality Governance

Defined authority, ownership, escalation, exception governance, policy management, gate governance, and framework evolution responsibilities.

#### Framework Lifecycle

Defined how the Quality Framework is:

* proposed;
* introduced;
* adopted;
* operated;
* evaluated;
* evolved;
* versioned;
* migrated;
* deprecated;
* retired.

#### Roadmap

Defined progressive implementation and adoption stages for transforming the normative framework into executable FamilyOS quality capabilities.

#### Validation

Defined structural, semantic, architectural, governance, dependency, and lifecycle validation requirements for the framework itself.

#### Release Model

Defined the release readiness and publication model for EPIC-QLT-001.

#### Implementation Checklist

Introduced the canonical implementation checklist describing the progressive path from documentation to executable quality infrastructure.

---

### Changed

#### Canonical Documentation Architecture

Replaced the previous generic engineering-oriented document structure with a dedicated Quality Framework architecture.

The canonical numbered documentation is now:

```text
00-EPIC.md
01-Context.md
02-Vision.md
03-Quality-Principles.md
04-Quality-Architecture.md
05-Quality-Domains.md
06-Quality-Rule-Model.md
07-Quality-Profiles.md
08-Quality-Metrics.md
09-Quality-Evidence.md
10-Quality-Risk-Management.md
11-Defect-and-Quality-Debt-Management.md
12-Quality-Reviews-and-Assessments.md
13-Quality-Automation.md
14-Quality-Observability.md
15-Quality-Gates.md
16-Quality-Compliance.md
17-Continuous-Improvement.md
18-Quality-Governance.md
19-Framework-Lifecycle.md
20-Roadmap.md
21-References.md
22-Validation.md
23-Summary.md
24-Release.md
25-Implementation-Checklist.md
```

The canonical structure therefore contains exactly **26 numbered documents**.

#### Control Documents

Aligned the EPIC control model around:

```text
EPIC-QLT-001.md
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

The complete canonical EPIC structure therefore contains:

```text
26 numbered documents
+
7 control documents
=
33 canonical files
```

#### Framework Boundaries

Clarified the relationship between EPIC-QLT-001 and neighboring FamilyOS engineering frameworks.

The Quality Framework consumes authoritative outputs from specialized frameworks rather than duplicating their responsibilities.

Key relationships include:

* EPIC-ENG-001 — Engineering Foundation;
* EPIC-TST-001 — Testing Framework;
* EPIC-DOC-001 — Documentation Framework;
* EPIC-BLD-001 — Build Framework;
* EPIC-REL-001 — Release Framework;
* EPIC-PLUGIN-002 — Plugin Compliance Framework.

#### Enforcement Strategy

Clarified that quality enforcement follows progressive adoption rather than immediate blocking enforcement.

#### AI Boundary

Clarified that future AI-assisted quality capabilities may support investigation, explanation, summarization, and pattern analysis but SHALL NOT silently replace deterministic quality controls or governed engineering authority.

### Removed

Removed the obsolete generic numbered documentation structure previously inherited from broader engineering framework templates, including documents such as:

* `01-Introduction.md`;
* `03-Engineering-Principles.md`;
* `04-Repository-Architecture.md`;
* `05-Development-Workflow.md`;
* `06-Coding-Standards.md`;
* `07-Project-Structure.md`;
* `08-Toolchain.md`;
* `09-Environment-Management.md`;
* `10-Dependency-Management.md`;
* `11-Configuration-Management.md`;
* `12-Build-Philosophy.md`;
* `13-Testing-Philosophy.md`;
* `14-Documentation-Philosophy.md`;
* `15-Quality-Philosophy.md`;
* `16-Technical-Governance.md`;
* `17-Engineering-Lifecycle.md`;
* `18-Roadmap.md`;
* `19-References.md`;
* `20-Validation.md`;
* `21-Summary.md`;
* `22-Release.md`;
* `23-Implementation-Checklist.md`.

These responsibilities were replaced by the specialized Quality Framework structure.

---

### Fixed

* Removed duplicate numbered document `23`.
* Established exactly one canonical document for every number from `00` through `25`.
* Extracted `23-Summary.md` from the previously concatenated document.
* Established `25-Implementation-Checklist.md` as the canonical implementation checklist.
* Corrected lifecycle, roadmap, and references filenames to match their internal responsibilities.
* Renamed:

  * `05-Quality-Model.md` to `05-Quality-Domains.md`;
  * `06-Quality-Attributes.md` to `06-Quality-Rule-Model.md`;
  * `07-Quality-Standards.md` to `07-Quality-Profiles.md`.
* Restored `00-EPIC.md` after accidental replacement by non-EPIC content.
* Removed duplicate document numbering.
* Eliminated empty canonical documents.
* Synchronized `EPIC.yaml`, `MANIFEST.md`, and `README.md` with the canonical documentation architecture.

### Major

Major versions may be required for significant changes such as:

* incompatible Quality Rule semantics;
* incompatible Quality Evidence schemas;
* major Quality Profile changes;
* changed gate semantics;
* major governance changes;
* incompatible framework boundaries;
* significant canonical architecture changes.

## Changelog Governance

Every significant Quality Framework revision SHOULD update this changelog.

Changes affecting authoritative semantics, structure, governance, lifecycle, validation, or implementation expectations SHALL be traceable through version control and the framework revision history.

`CHANGELOG.md` records **what changed**.

`Revision-History.md` records the broader **revision history and publication state**.

`VALIDATION.md` records the **validation evidence and outcome** associated with the relevant framework revision.

EPIC:       EPIC-QLT-001
Framework:  Quality Framework
Version:    1.0.0
Status:     Completed
Owner:      FamilyOS Engineering
```

The normative documentation architecture is established.
