# Quality Framework

## 18 Quality Governance

### Overview

The FamilyOS Quality Governance model defines the authority, ownership, decision structures, policies, responsibilities, controls, escalation mechanisms, and lifecycle rules required to govern quality consistently across the FamilyOS engineering ecosystem.

Quality Governance ensures that the Quality Framework does not remain only a collection of recommendations, metrics, checks, and automation.

It establishes who may define quality expectations, how those expectations become authoritative, how exceptions are controlled, how quality decisions are made, and how the framework evolves.

The governance relationship is:

```text
FamilyOS Vision
      ↓
Engineering Constitution
      ↓
Architecture and Engineering Governance
      ↓
Quality Governance
      ↓
Quality Policy
      ↓
Quality Requirements
      ↓
Quality Rules and Profiles
      ↓
Verification and Evidence
      ↓
Quality Assessments
      ↓
Quality Gates
      ↓
Engineering Decisions
```

Quality Governance therefore provides the authority layer of the FamilyOS Quality Framework.

The central question is:

```text
Who has the authority to define, evaluate, accept,
change, override, and improve FamilyOS quality policy?
```

---

## Purpose

The purpose of Quality Governance is to ensure that quality decisions are:

* authoritative;
* consistent;
* transparent;
* evidence-based;
* risk-aware;
* traceable;
* proportional;
* reviewable;
* enforceable;
* evolvable.

Without governance, different teams, plugins, repositories, or lifecycle stages may interpret quality differently.

The result may become:

```text
Different Standards
      ↓
Different Interpretations
      ↓
Different Enforcement
      ↓
Inconsistent Quality
```

The desired model is:

```text
Common Quality Governance
      ↓
Explicit Authority
      ↓
Versioned Policy
      ↓
Consistent Enforcement
      ↓
Traceable Decisions
      ↓
Continuous Improvement
```

---

## Foundational Principle

The foundational principle is:

> Quality authority must be explicit, proportional, evidence-based, and traceable.

No significant quality decision should depend entirely on undocumented personal judgment.

Human judgment remains essential, but authoritative decisions should preserve:

```text
Context
Evidence
Reason
Authority
Outcome
```

---

## Governance Scope

Quality Governance applies to:

```text
Quality Principles
Quality Policy
Quality Requirements
Quality Rules
Quality Profiles
Quality Metrics
Quality Evidence
Quality Assessments
Quality Risks
Quality Debt
Quality Exceptions
Quality Gates
Quality Compliance
Quality Automation
Quality Observability
Continuous Improvement
```

It therefore governs both quality expectations and the mechanisms used to enforce them.

---

## Governance Objectives

Quality Governance exists to achieve several objectives.

### Consistency

Equivalent quality conditions should receive equivalent treatment.

### Accountability

Important quality responsibilities should have clear ownership.

### Traceability

Important decisions should be reconstructable.

### Proportionality

Governance effort should correspond to risk.

### Independence

Critical quality decisions should not depend solely on delivery pressure.

### Evolution

Quality policy must be able to change safely as FamilyOS evolves.

---

## Governance Model

The conceptual governance model is:

```text
FamilyOS Governance
      ↓
Engineering Governance
      ↓
Quality Governance
      ↓
┌───────────────────────────────────┐
│ Quality Policy                    │
│ Quality Requirements              │
│ Quality Profiles                  │
│ Quality Rules                     │
│ Quality Gates                     │
│ Quality Exceptions                │
│ Quality Reviews                   │
└───────────────────────────────────┘
      ↓
Engineering Lifecycle
```

Quality Governance must remain aligned with broader FamilyOS governance.

---

## Governance Hierarchy

A conceptual authority hierarchy may be:

```text
FamilyOS Vision
      ↓
Engineering Constitution
      ↓
Architecture Decisions
      ↓
Engineering Frameworks
      ↓
Quality Framework
      ↓
Quality Policies
      ↓
Quality Requirements
      ↓
Quality Rules
      ↓
Automation Configuration
```

Lower-level mechanisms must not contradict higher-level authority.

---

## Normative Hierarchy

When quality documents conflict, the authoritative hierarchy must determine precedence.

A conceptual hierarchy is:

```text
Engineering Constitution
      ↓
Approved ADR / Architecture Authority
      ↓
Normative Framework
      ↓
Approved Specification / RFC
      ↓
Quality Policy
      ↓
Quality Profile
      ↓
Quality Rule
      ↓
Tool Configuration
```

The exact hierarchy should remain aligned with the FamilyOS Documentation and Engineering Governance models.

---

## Governance Authority

Governance Authority represents the ability to make an authoritative quality decision.

Authorities may include:

```text
Framework Authority
Domain Authority
Architecture Authority
Security Authority
Release Authority
Quality Authority
Repository Authority
```

The applicable authority depends on the decision.

---

## Authority Principle

Authority should follow responsibility and risk.

For example:

```text
Low-Risk Local Rule Adjustment
      ↓
Quality Domain Owner

Critical Release Override
      ↓
Release Governance Authority
```

Not every decision requires the highest governance level.

---

## Quality Authority

Quality Authority is responsible for maintaining the integrity of the Quality Framework.

Responsibilities may include:

* maintaining quality principles;
* maintaining common quality models;
* approving cross-cutting quality policy;
* resolving framework-level conflicts;
* reviewing significant framework changes;
* monitoring framework effectiveness.

---

## Domain Authority

Specific quality domains may have dedicated authorities.

Examples include:

```text
Testing
Documentation
Security
Architecture
Build
Release
Plugin Compliance
```

Domain authorities define domain-specific requirements within the common Quality Governance model.

---

## Federated Governance

FamilyOS should use federated quality governance where appropriate.

Conceptually:

```text
Quality Framework
      ↓
Common Governance Model
      ↓
┌───────────────────────────────────┐
│ Testing Authority                 │
│ Documentation Authority           │
│ Security Authority                │
│ Architecture Authority            │
│ Plugin Compliance Authority       │
└───────────────────────────────────┘
```

This avoids centralizing every technical decision in one authority.

---

## Central Governance Responsibilities

Central Quality Governance should focus on:

```text
Common Quality Semantics
Common Severity Model
Common Evidence Model
Common Assessment Model
Common Risk Model
Common Gate Principles
Cross-Domain Policy
Framework Evolution
```

Domain-specific technical details should remain with the appropriate framework.

---

## Governance Roles

A mature Quality Governance model may distinguish roles such as:

```text
Quality Framework Owner
Quality Domain Owner
Rule Owner
Profile Owner
Gate Owner
Risk Owner
Debt Owner
Exception Owner
Assessment Reviewer
Release Authority
```

A single person may hold several roles in smaller project stages.

---

## Quality Framework Owner

The Quality Framework Owner is responsible for:

* framework integrity;
* framework documentation;
* common quality concepts;
* framework evolution;
* cross-domain consistency.

---

## Quality Domain Owner

A Quality Domain Owner is responsible for a specific quality domain.

Responsibilities may include:

```text
Requirements
Rules
Metrics
Risk Interpretation
Automation
Documentation
Improvement
```

---

## Rule Owner

A Rule Owner is responsible for:

* rule purpose;
* implementation;
* correctness;
* false-positive management;
* versioning;
* retirement.

Rules without ownership may become unreliable technical debt.

---

## Profile Owner

A Quality Profile Owner is responsible for ensuring that the profile contains the correct requirements for its target class.

---

## Gate Owner

A Gate Owner maintains:

```text
Gate Policy
Gate Documentation
Gate Effectiveness
Automation Integration
Escalation Rules
```

Gate ownership does not automatically grant override authority.

---

## Risk Owner

A Risk Owner is responsible for:

* understanding the risk;
* monitoring mitigation;
* maintaining risk state;
* escalating when necessary.

Risk ownership does not necessarily mean the owner may accept the risk.

---

## Quality Debt Owner

Quality Debt should have accountable ownership where remediation is expected.

The owner is responsible for:

```text
Remediation Planning
Status Maintenance
Risk Monitoring
Closure Evidence
```

---

## Exception Owner

An Exception Owner ensures that:

* conditions remain valid;
* mitigation remains active;
* expiration is monitored;
* remediation progresses.

---

## Release Authority

Release Authority determines whether release-specific governance requirements are satisfied.

It may consume Quality Gate decisions but should not silently alter underlying Quality Assessments.

---

## Separation of Duties

Critical quality decisions may require separation of duties.

For example:

```text
Developer
      ↓
Creates Change

Quality Automation
      ↓
Produces Evidence

Reviewer
      ↓
Reviews Change

Release Authority
      ↓
Approves Release
```

The same individual should not necessarily control every step for high-risk transitions.

---

## Separation of Policy and Implementation

A core governance principle is:

```text
Governance
      ↓
Defines Policy

Automation
      ↓
Implements Policy
```

Tool configuration must not become an undocumented source of policy.

---

## Separation of Assessment and Progression

Quality Assessment answers:

```text
What is the quality state?
```

Quality Gate answers:

```text
May the target progress?
```

Governance must preserve this distinction.

---

## Separation of Risk and Compliance

Compliance answers:

```text
Are applicable requirements satisfied?
```

Risk answers:

```text
What uncertainty or potential harm remains?
```

A compliant target may still carry risk.

A non-compliant target may have different levels of risk.

Governance must consider both.

---

## Quality Policy

Quality Policy defines authoritative expectations governing quality behavior.

Policies may define:

```text
Required Quality Domains
Severity Handling
Assessment Requirements
Gate Conditions
Exception Rules
Risk Acceptance
Evidence Requirements
```

---

## Policy Identity

Formal policies should have stable identities where practical.

A conceptual format may be:

```text
QLT-POL-<DOMAIN>-<NUMBER>
```

Examples:

```text
QLT-POL-GATE-001
QLT-POL-RISK-002
QLT-POL-EVID-001
```

---

## Policy Metadata

A policy may contain:

```text
id
title
purpose
authority
scope
requirements
owner
version
effective_date
status
```

---

## Policy Lifecycle

A policy may move through:

```text
PROPOSED
      ↓
REVIEW
      ↓
APPROVED
      ↓
ACTIVE
      ↓
DEPRECATED
      ↓
RETIRED
```

Emergency policy changes may use an accelerated but still traceable path.

---

## Policy Proposal

A policy proposal should explain:

```text
Problem
Evidence
Proposed Policy
Affected Targets
Expected Benefit
Migration Impact
Risk
```

---

## Policy Review

Policy review should consider:

* necessity;
* clarity;
* enforceability;
* proportionality;
* compatibility;
* implementation cost;
* developer impact;
* risk reduction.

---

## Policy Approval

The approving authority depends on policy scope.

Example:

```text
Local Repository Policy
      → Repository Authority

Cross-Framework Quality Policy
      → Quality Governance

Architecture Quality Policy
      → Architecture + Quality Governance
```

---

## Policy Effective Date

Policies should identify when they become effective.

This enables staged rollout and historical interpretation.

---

## Policy Deprecation

Policies should be deprecated when:

* replaced;
* obsolete;
* incompatible with new architecture;
* no longer useful.

Deprecated policies should identify their replacement where applicable.

---

## Policy Retirement

Retired policies should no longer govern new assessments.

Historical decisions should remain interpretable against them.

---

## Quality Requirement Governance

Requirements should not appear arbitrarily.

The lifecycle is:

```text
Engineering Need
      ↓
Authoritative Decision
      ↓
Requirement Definition
      ↓
Review
      ↓
Approval
      ↓
Rule / Verification
      ↓
Enforcement
```

---

## Requirement Authority

Every mandatory requirement should identify its authority.

Examples include:

```text
ADR
RFC
Specification
Framework
Policy
Security Requirement
Release Policy
```

---

## Requirement Ownership

Every active requirement should have an owner or governing domain.

Orphaned mandatory requirements should trigger review.

---

## Requirement Review

Requirements should be reviewed for:

```text
Clarity
Necessity
Testability
Risk Alignment
Duplication
Consistency
```

---

## Requirement Change

Changing a mandatory requirement may affect:

* compliance;
* gates;
* automation;
* documentation;
* existing targets.

Changes should therefore include impact analysis.

---

## Quality Rule Governance

Rules operationalize requirements.

Rule governance ensures they remain:

* accurate;
* useful;
* maintainable;
* aligned with authority.

---

## Rule Introduction

A new rule should identify:

```text
Requirement
Risk
Verification Logic
Severity
Scope
Expected Evidence
```

---

## Rule Rollout

New rules may use:

```text
OBSERVE
      ↓
WARN
      ↓
ENFORCE
```

This reduces disruptive enforcement.

---

## Rule Calibration

Rules should be calibrated using real engineering evidence.

Signals include:

```text
False Positives
False Negatives
Suppression Rate
Finding Frequency
Execution Cost
Escaped Defects
```

---

## Rule Modification

Significant rule changes should preserve:

* version history;
* rationale;
* affected requirements;
* migration implications.

---

## Rule Retirement

A rule may be retired when:

```text
Requirement Removed
Control Replaced
Risk Eliminated
Rule Ineffective
Architecture Changed
```

Retirement should remain traceable.

---

## Quality Profile Governance

Quality Profiles define requirement sets for target classes.

Profile changes can significantly affect compliance and gate behavior.

They therefore require controlled governance.

---

## Profile Ownership

Every profile should have a defined owner.

---

## Profile Versioning

Profiles should be versioned when requirement changes affect compliance semantics.

Example:

```text
official-plugin-v1
official-plugin-v2
```

---

## Profile Compatibility

Profile evolution should consider whether existing targets immediately become non-compliant.

Migration strategies may be required.

---

## Profile Migration

A profile migration may use:

```text
Old Profile
      ↓
New Requirements Introduced
      ↓
Observation Period
      ↓
Remediation
      ↓
New Profile Enforced
```

---

## Severity Governance

Severity classifications affect:

* prioritization;
* gates;
* alerts;
* remediation;
* risk.

Severity policy must therefore remain consistent.

---

## Severity Authority

The Quality Framework should define the common severity model.

Domain frameworks may provide domain-specific interpretation without redefining common semantics arbitrarily.

---

## Severity Escalation

A finding may be escalated when new context increases risk.

Example:

```text
Initial Finding:
MEDIUM

Affected Component:
Critical Security Boundary

Reassessment:
HIGH
```

Escalation should preserve rationale.

---

## Severity Downgrade

Downgrades should also require documented reasoning.

Severity should not be reduced simply to make a gate pass.

---

## Risk Governance

Quality Governance defines how quality risks are:

```text
Identified
Classified
Owned
Mitigated
Accepted
Escalated
Closed
```

---

## Risk Acceptance Authority

Risk acceptance authority should correspond to risk level.

A conceptual model may be:

```text
LOW
      → Domain Owner

MEDIUM
      → Engineering Authority

HIGH
      → Quality / Architecture / Release Authority

CRITICAL
      → Highest Applicable Governance Authority
```

Exact authority mappings should be formally defined.

---

## Risk Acceptance Principle

Risk acceptance must be explicit.

Silence is not acceptance.

---

## Risk Acceptance Record

A risk acceptance should include:

```text
Risk
Impact
Likelihood
Residual Risk
Reason
Authority
Conditions
Expiration
```

---

## Temporary Risk Acceptance

Some risk acceptance may be temporary.

Expiration should trigger reassessment.

---

## Risk Escalation

Risks should escalate when:

* severity increases;
* mitigation fails;
* deadline expires;
* scope expands;
* operational evidence worsens.

---

## Quality Debt Governance

Quality Debt requires governance because tolerated debt can accumulate silently.

Governance should define:

```text
Debt Classification
Ownership
Risk
Priority
Review
Remediation
Closure
```

---

## Debt Acceptance

Creating Quality Debt should not become a routine substitute for meeting quality requirements.

Significant debt should require explicit acknowledgement.

---

## Debt Budget

Governance may define debt budgets for selected domains.

Example:

```text
New Critical Debt:
0 allowed

New High-Risk Debt:
Requires explicit approval
```

Debt budgets should encourage improvement.

---

## Debt Aging

Older debt may require escalation.

Conceptually:

```text
Debt Age ↑
      ↓
Review Priority ↑
```

especially when risk or interest also increases.

---

## Debt Closure

Debt should close only when remediation is verified.

Closing an issue without correcting the underlying quality condition is insufficient.

---

## Exception Governance

Quality Exceptions require strong governance because they intentionally permit deviation from normal policy.

---

## Exception Principle

An exception must be:

```text
Explicit
Scoped
Owned
Risk-Assessed
Authorized
Time-Bounded where practical
Observable
```

---

## Exception Authority

The authority required should depend on:

* affected requirement;
* severity;
* target criticality;
* lifecycle stage.

---

## Exception Request

A request should include:

```text
Requirement
Target
Deviation
Reason
Risk
Mitigation
Owner
Requested Duration
```

---

## Exception Review

The reviewing authority should evaluate:

```text
Is the exception necessary?

Is the scope minimal?

Is the risk understood?

Are compensating controls available?

Is remediation planned?

Is the duration reasonable?
```

---

## Exception Approval

Approval should create an authoritative exception record.

Verbal or undocumented approval is insufficient for governed exceptions.

---

## Exception Expiration

Expired exceptions must automatically lose authority where automation supports it.

---

## Exception Renewal

Renewal should be explicit and should reassess:

* continued necessity;
* current risk;
* remediation progress.

---

## Exception Revocation

An exception may be revoked before expiration when:

* risk increases;
* conditions are violated;
* remediation is completed;
* authority determines continuation is unacceptable.

---

## Exception Inventory

Governance should maintain visibility into:

```text
Active Exceptions
Expiring Exceptions
Expired Exceptions
Exceptions by Domain
Exceptions by Requirement
Exceptions by Owner
```

---

## Override Governance

Gate overrides require stronger governance than normal exceptions because they directly alter progression decisions.

---

## Override Principle

An override changes:

```text
Progression Authority
```

not:

```text
Underlying Quality State
```

---

## Override Requirements

A formal override should contain:

```text
Gate
Original Decision
Target
Revision
Reason
Risk
Authority
Conditions
Timestamp
```

---

## Override Review

Overrides should be reviewed after the event, especially for:

* releases;
* Critical gates;
* emergency deployments.

Repeated overrides may indicate systemic governance problems.

---

## Emergency Governance

FamilyOS may require emergency quality decisions.

Emergency governance must preserve:

```text
Authority
Evidence
Risk Awareness
Traceability
Follow-Up
```

even when normal process is accelerated.

---

## Emergency Principle

Emergency does not mean uncontrolled.

The process may become faster, but the decision must remain explicit.

---

## Emergency Override

A conceptual emergency flow is:

```text
Urgent Condition
      ↓
Available Quality State
      ↓
Risk Assessment
      ↓
Emergency Authority
      ↓
Controlled Override
      ↓
Immediate Action
      ↓
Mandatory Follow-Up Review
```

---

## Post-Emergency Review

A post-emergency review should determine:

```text
Why was emergency action required?

Which controls were bypassed?

What risk was accepted?

Did any quality problem occur?

Should the normal process change?
```

---

## Quality Assessment Governance

Formal Quality Assessments should follow governed models.

Governance should define:

* required domains;
* assessment states;
* evidence expectations;
* aggregation rules;
* authority.

---

## Assessment Independence

High-risk assessments may require independent review.

The implementation author should not always be the sole authority determining final quality state.

---

## Assessment Reassessment

Assessments should be repeated when relevant state changes.

Examples include:

```text
Target Revision Changes
Evidence Changes
Profile Changes
Critical Finding Appears
Exception Expires
```

---

## Assessment Dispute

Engineers may challenge an assessment when they believe:

* evidence is incorrect;
* rule interpretation is wrong;
* applicability is incorrect;
* severity is inappropriate.

Governance should provide a resolution path.

---

## Dispute Resolution

A conceptual path is:

```text
Assessment Dispute
      ↓
Rule / Domain Owner Review
      ↓
Evidence Review
      ↓
Decision
      ↓
Assessment Updated or Confirmed
```

Escalation may occur when required.

---

## Quality Gate Governance

Governance determines:

```text
Which Gates Exist
Where They Apply
Which Inputs Are Required
What Blocks Progression
Who Owns the Gate
Who May Override It
```

---

## Gate Policy Authority

Gate policies should have explicit authority.

A CI administrator should not independently redefine release quality requirements through pipeline configuration.

---

## Gate Enforcement Audit

Governance should periodically verify that:

```text
Required Gates Exist
Required Gates Are Enabled
Policies Match Documentation
Bypasses Are Controlled
Overrides Are Recorded
```

---

## Quality Compliance Governance

Compliance governance determines:

* requirement authority;
* profile authority;
* rule authority;
* exception handling;
* certification policy;
* audit policy.

---

## Compliance Certification Authority

If FamilyOS introduces formal internal certification, the authority issuing certification must be explicit.

Certification should never be generated solely from an ungoverned tool result.

---

## Quality Automation Governance

Quality Automation executes policy.

Governance should ensure that automation remains aligned with authoritative requirements.

---

## Automation Ownership

Every critical quality automation component should have an owner.

Examples include:

```text
Quality CLI
Compliance Engine
Gate Engine
Evidence Collector
Architecture Validator
Documentation Validator
```

---

## Automation Change Control

Changes to critical automation should be reviewed when they may affect:

* compliance results;
* gate decisions;
* evidence;
* severity;
* policy enforcement.

---

## Automation Failure Governance

Critical automation failure should have defined behavior.

Possible policies include:

```text
Fail Closed
Fail With Explicit ERROR
Allow Controlled Manual Verification
```

The behavior should depend on risk.

---

## Automation Trust

Automation should earn authority through:

```text
Testing
Versioning
Reliability
Traceability
Controlled Deployment
```

A broken tool must not remain silently authoritative.

---

## Quality Evidence Governance

Governance should define which evidence types are authoritative for specific decisions.

---

## Evidence Authority

Examples:

```text
Test Compliance
      → authoritative test result

Architecture Approval
      → architecture assessment + required review

Release Compliance
      → release compliance assessment
```

Not all evidence has equal authority.

---

## Evidence Integrity

Important evidence should be protected against:

* unauthorized modification;
* accidental overwrite;
* ambiguous revision identity.

---

## Evidence Retention Governance

Retention should correspond to lifecycle significance.

For example:

```text
Local Developer Check
      → short retention

Release Gate Evidence
      → long retention
```

---

## Quality Metrics Governance

Metrics can strongly influence engineering behavior.

They therefore require governance.

---

## Metric Definition

Each important metric should define:

```text
Purpose
Calculation
Data Source
Dimensions
Interpretation
Owner
```

---

## Metric Change

Changes to metric calculation should be documented.

Historical comparisons may otherwise become misleading.

---

## Metric Misuse

Governance should prevent metrics from becoming simplistic performance targets.

For example:

```text
Finding Count per Developer
```

should not become an individual productivity measure.

---

## Responsible Measurement

Quality metrics should evaluate:

```text
Systems
Artifacts
Processes
Quality Outcomes
```

rather than create employee surveillance.

---

## Quality Observability Governance

Observability governance should ensure that:

* telemetry is reliable;
* dashboards are interpretable;
* stale state is visible;
* sensitive data is protected;
* alerts remain actionable.

---

## Dashboard Authority

A dashboard is a presentation layer.

It must not become a new source of quality truth.

Authoritative state remains in underlying governed records.

---

## Alert Governance

Alert policy should define:

```text
Which Conditions Alert
Severity
Recipient / Owner
Escalation
Deduplication
```

---

## Continuous Improvement Governance

Continuous Improvement requires governance to ensure important systemic problems become owned engineering work.

---

## Improvement Authority

Small improvements may proceed through normal engineering workflow.

Cross-cutting or architectural improvements may require higher authority.

---

## Improvement Prioritization

Governance should consider:

```text
Risk
Quality Debt
Operational Impact
Strategic Value
Engineering Cost
```

Quality improvement should compete fairly with feature development.

---

## Improvement Verification

Significant improvements should demonstrate whether the expected outcome was achieved.

---

## Governance Reviews

Quality Governance should itself be reviewed periodically.

A governance review may examine:

```text
Policy Effectiveness
Rule Effectiveness
Gate Effectiveness
Exception Trends
Override Trends
Risk Trends
Debt Trends
Automation Reliability
Compliance Trends
```

---

## Governance Review Questions

A mature governance review should ask:

```text
Are quality policies still appropriate?

Are important risks escaping?

Are rules producing excessive noise?

Are exceptions becoming permanent?

Are gates frequently overridden?

Are responsibilities clear?

Are decisions traceable?

Is governance creating unnecessary friction?

Where should governance become stronger?

Where should governance become simpler?
```

---

## Governance Effectiveness

Governance effectiveness should be judged by outcomes.

Strong governance is not governance with the most approvals.

Strong governance produces:

```text
Clear Decisions
Appropriate Controls
Reduced Risk
Consistent Quality
Fast Feedback
Traceability
Sustainable Engineering
```

---

## Governance Friction

Governance itself can create Quality Debt if it becomes unnecessarily complex.

Signals include:

* excessive approval delays;
* duplicated reviews;
* unclear ownership;
* conflicting policies;
* manual evidence duplication.

These should trigger improvement.

---

## Proportional Governance

The governance effort should correspond to risk.

Example:

```text
Documentation Typo
      ↓
Normal Review

Core Identity Architecture Change
      ↓
Architecture Review
Security Review
Quality Assessment
Strict Gate
```

---

## Risk-Based Governance

A conceptual model is:

```text
Risk ↑
      ↓
Evidence Depth ↑
Review Depth ↑
Authority Level ↑
Gate Strength ↑
```

This avoids both under-governance and unnecessary bureaucracy.

---

## Governance Escalation

Escalation is required when a decision exceeds local authority.

Examples include:

```text
Critical Risk
Unresolved Cross-Domain Conflict
Release Gate Override
Architecture Policy Conflict
Repeated Governance Failure
```

---

## Escalation Path

A conceptual path may be:

```text
Rule Owner
      ↓
Domain Owner
      ↓
Quality Authority
      ↓
Engineering / Architecture Governance
      ↓
Highest Applicable FamilyOS Authority
```

Not every issue should traverse the entire chain.

---

## Cross-Domain Conflict

Quality domains may occasionally conflict.

Example:

```text
Security Requirement
      vs
Performance Requirement
```

or:

```text
Architecture Purity
      vs
Migration Risk
```

Governance must provide a mechanism to resolve such conflicts explicitly.

---

## Conflict Resolution

Conflict resolution should consider:

```text
Authoritative Requirements
Risk
Evidence
Alternatives
Long-Term Impact
```

The decision should be documented when significant.

---

## Decision Record

Important governance decisions should create durable records.

Depending on significance, this may be:

```text
Quality Decision Record
ADR
RFC
Risk Acceptance
Exception
Gate Override
Review Record
```

---

## Decision Identity

Formal quality governance decisions may use stable identifiers.

Conceptually:

```text
QLT-DEC-<NUMBER>
```

This is optional where an existing ADR, RFC, or other governed identifier already provides authority.

---

## Decision Metadata

A decision record may contain:

```text
id
decision
context
evidence
alternatives
authority
date
scope
consequences
```

---

## Decision Traceability

A quality decision should answer:

```text
Why was this decision made?

Who had authority?

Which evidence was considered?

Which policy applied?

What consequences were accepted?
```

---

## Governance Audit Trail

Significant quality governance actions should remain auditable.

Examples include:

```text
Policy Changes
Requirement Changes
Rule Changes
Risk Acceptance
Exceptions
Overrides
Profile Changes
Gate Changes
```

---

## Governance Immutability

Historical governance decisions should not be silently rewritten.

A changed decision should supersede the previous record while preserving history.

---

## Governance Versioning

Policies, profiles, rules, and other normative quality artifacts should use controlled versioning.

Versioning enables historical reconstruction.

---

## Governance Change Management

Significant changes should follow:

```text
Proposal
      ↓
Impact Analysis
      ↓
Review
      ↓
Approval
      ↓
Migration
      ↓
Enforcement
      ↓
Observation
```

---

## Impact Analysis

Quality governance changes should consider effects on:

```text
Existing Code
Plugins
Documentation
CI
Compliance
Quality Gates
Release Process
Developer Workflow
```

---

## Breaking Governance Change

A governance change is effectively breaking when previously acceptable targets become blocked without implementation changes.

Such changes require careful migration planning.

---

## Governance Migration

Migration may use:

```text
Announcement
      ↓
Observation
      ↓
Warnings
      ↓
Remediation
      ↓
Enforcement
```

---

## Governance Documentation

All significant quality governance mechanisms should be documented.

Engineers should be able to discover:

```text
What is required?

Why?

Who owns it?

How is it verified?

What happens when it fails?

How are exceptions handled?

How can policy change?
```

---

## Governance Discoverability

Governance should not depend on hidden knowledge.

Policy and ownership should be easy to locate.

---

## Governance Registry

A future Quality Platform may maintain registries for:

```text
Policies
Requirements
Rules
Profiles
Gates
Exceptions
Risks
Owners
```

This may provide a unified governance view.

---

## Policy Registry

A Policy Registry may expose:

```text
Policy ID
Owner
Version
Status
Scope
Effective Date
```

---

## Requirement Registry

A Requirement Registry may expose:

```text
Requirement
Authority
Domain
Owner
Applicability
Verification
Status
```

---

## Rule Registry

A Rule Registry may expose:

```text
Rule
Requirement
Owner
Severity
Automation
Version
Status
```

---

## Gate Registry

A Gate Registry may expose:

```text
Gate
Boundary
Profile
Owner
Authority
Override Policy
Status
```

---

## Exception Registry

An Exception Registry may expose:

```text
Exception
Requirement
Target
Owner
Authority
Expiration
Risk
Status
```

---

## Ownership Registry

A future governance model may provide discoverable ownership.

Example:

```text
Testing Quality
      → Testing Framework Owner

Plugin Compliance
      → Plugin Compliance Owner

Release Gate
      → Release Governance
```

---

## Governance as Code

Machine-verifiable governance should increasingly be represented as version-controlled configuration.

Examples include:

```text
Quality Profiles
Gate Policies
Rule Configuration
Severity Mapping
Applicability Rules
```

---

## Governance as Code Principle

Governance as Code does not eliminate human authority.

It ensures that deterministic policy becomes:

* explicit;
* reviewable;
* version-controlled;
* reproducible;
* automatable.

---

## Policy Validation

Governance configuration should itself be validated.

Examples include:

```text
Unknown Requirement
Invalid Profile
Missing Owner
Invalid Severity
Broken Gate Reference
```

Invalid governance configuration must fail visibly.

---

## Policy Testing

Quality policy should be testable where practical.

Example:

```text
Critical Finding
      → Release Gate FAIL

Valid Exception
      → Conditional behavior

Expired Exception
      → Blocking condition restored
```

---

## Governance Security

Quality Governance is part of the FamilyOS control plane.

Unauthorized modification may undermine the entire engineering assurance model.

---

## Governance Threats

Potential threats include:

```text
Unauthorized Policy Change
Unauthorized Gate Disablement
Forged Exception
Evidence Manipulation
Unauthorized Risk Acceptance
Override Abuse
```

---

## Governance Authorization

Sensitive governance operations should require appropriate authorization.

Examples include:

* changing release gate policy;
* accepting Critical risk;
* approving high-impact exceptions;
* overriding protected gates.

---

## Least Privilege

Governance permissions should follow least privilege.

A contributor who can modify source code should not automatically have authority to disable the quality controls evaluating that source.

---

## Governance Integrity

Important governance records should preserve:

```text
Identity
Authority
Timestamp
Target
Revision
Decision
Reason
```

---

## Governance Availability

Critical governance systems should be available when required for engineering progression.

If unavailable, the failure behavior should be explicit.

---

## Governance Failure

Governance mechanisms themselves may fail.

Examples include:

```text
Missing Policy
Conflicting Requirements
Unknown Owner
Broken Gate Configuration
Expired Unreviewed Exception
Unavailable Authority
```

These should create visible governance findings.

---

## Governance Finding

A Governance Finding represents a problem in the quality governance system itself.

Examples include:

```text
Unowned Critical Risk
Expired Exception Still Applied
Gate Without Owner
Requirement Without Authority
Conflicting Active Policies
```

---

## Governance Quality Debt

Governance weaknesses may become Quality Debt.

Examples include:

* manual exception tracking;
* undocumented ownership;
* duplicated policies;
* unautomated gate enforcement.

---

## Governance Metrics

Potential governance metrics include:

```text
Active Policies
Active Exceptions
Expired Exceptions
Override Count
Override Rate
Unowned Risks
Unowned Debt
Policy Change Frequency
Governance Review Findings
```

---

## Governance Trend

Trend analysis may reveal systemic problems.

Example:

```text
Release 1    1 override
Release 2    3 overrides
Release 3    7 overrides
```

This should trigger governance review.

---

## Exception Trend

A growing exception inventory may indicate:

```text
Unrealistic Policy
Growing Quality Debt
Insufficient Remediation
Weak Enforcement
```

---

## Unowned Work Trend

The number of unowned risks, debt items, and exceptions should ideally approach zero for significant items.

---

## Governance Dashboard

A future dashboard may expose:

```text
FamilyOS Quality Governance

Active Policies          28
Active Profiles           6
Active Gates              9

Critical Risks            0
Unowned High Risks        0

Active Exceptions         3
Expiring Exceptions       1
Expired Exceptions        0

Gate Overrides            0

Governance Health         HEALTHY
```

---

## Governance Health

A conceptual governance health model may include:

```text
HEALTHY
DEGRADED
AT_RISK
CRITICAL
UNKNOWN
```

This state should summarize governance conditions without hiding detailed findings.

---

## Governance Review Cadence

Governance should be reviewed:

```text
Periodically
After Major Releases
After Significant Incidents
After Critical Overrides
After Major Framework Changes
```

The cadence should remain proportional to project maturity and activity.

---

## Framework Governance

The Quality Framework itself requires governance.

Changes to fundamental concepts such as:

```text
Severity Model
Assessment States
Risk Model
Evidence Model
Gate Semantics
Compliance Semantics
```

should receive stronger review than local rule changes.

---

## Framework Compatibility

Framework evolution should consider compatibility with:

```text
Testing Framework
Documentation Framework
Build Framework
Release Framework
Plugin Compliance Framework
Architecture Foundation
Engineering Foundation
```

Cross-framework contradictions should be resolved explicitly.

---

## Framework Versioning

Major semantic changes may require framework version changes.

Historical quality records should remain interpretable.

---

## Framework Deprecation

Deprecated framework concepts should identify:

* replacement;
* migration path;
* retirement timeline.

---

## Governance and Architecture

Architecture Governance defines architectural authority.

Quality Governance converts applicable architectural decisions into:

```text
Requirements
Rules
Assessments
Gates
```

The two governance systems must remain aligned.

---

## Governance and Testing

The Testing Framework governs testing strategy.

Quality Governance determines how testing state contributes to broader quality decisions and lifecycle progression.

---

## Governance and Documentation

The Documentation Framework governs documentation requirements.

Quality Governance integrates documentation quality into broader assessments, compliance, and gates.

---

## Governance and Build

The Build Framework governs build behavior.

Quality Governance defines which build quality conditions affect engineering progression.

---

## Governance and Release

Release Governance and Quality Governance intersect strongly at Release Gates.

Release authority controls release progression.

Quality authority provides authoritative quality state.

Neither should silently redefine the other.

---

## Governance and Plugin Compliance

The Plugin Compliance Framework defines specialized plugin compliance requirements.

Quality Governance provides common authority, severity, evidence, exception, and gate principles.

---

## Governance and Security

Security may require specialized authority for security-sensitive risks, exceptions, and releases.

Quality Governance must preserve those authority boundaries.

---

## Governance and Quality Metrics

Metrics provide information.

Governance determines how that information influences decisions.

---

## Governance and Quality Evidence

Evidence provides factual support.

Governance determines which evidence is required and authoritative.

---

## Governance and Quality Risk

Governance defines:

```text
Risk Ownership
Risk Acceptance Authority
Escalation
Review
```

---

## Governance and Quality Debt

Governance prevents Quality Debt from becoming invisible permanent degradation.

---

## Governance and Quality Reviews

Quality Reviews provide evidence for governance decisions and policy evolution.

---

## Governance and Quality Automation

Automation operationalizes governed policy.

Governance ensures automation remains aligned with authoritative intent.

---

## Governance and Quality Observability

Observability makes governance state visible.

It exposes:

```text
Exceptions
Overrides
Policy Changes
Risks
Debt
Gate Decisions
Governance Findings
```

---

## Governance and Quality Gates

Quality Gates are the primary enforcement mechanism for many governance policies.

---

## Governance and Quality Compliance

Compliance operationalizes normative requirements.

Governance determines which requirements are authoritative and how exceptions are handled.

---

## Governance and Continuous Improvement

Continuous Improvement provides feedback on governance effectiveness.

The relationship is:

```text
Governance
      ↓
Quality Controls
      ↓
Engineering Outcomes
      ↓
Observability
      ↓
Continuous Improvement
      ↓
Governance Evolution
```

---

## Governance Anti-Patterns

The FamilyOS Quality Framework rejects several governance anti-patterns.

### Governance by Memory

Important rules must not depend on what individuals remember.

### Authority Without Ownership

Authority should have accountable responsibility.

### Ownership Without Authority

Owners must have enough authority to maintain their governed area.

### Tool Configuration as Hidden Policy

CI configuration must not silently define quality policy.

### Permanent Exceptions

Exceptions must not become invisible policy replacements.

### Silent Overrides

Progression overrides must remain traceable.

### Approval Inflation

Adding more approvals does not automatically improve quality.

### Governance Everywhere

Low-risk work should not require high-cost governance.

### Policy Without Enforcement

Mandatory policy should have a credible enforcement path.

### Enforcement Without Policy

Automation should not impose undocumented requirements.

### Metrics as Governance

A metric alone should not replace contextual engineering judgment.

### Governance Without Feedback

Policy that never adapts to engineering outcomes eventually becomes ineffective.

---

## Initial Governance Model

An initial FamilyOS Quality Governance implementation may remain lightweight.

It should establish at minimum:

```text
Quality Framework Ownership
Domain Ownership
Requirement Authority
Rule Ownership
Quality Gate Ownership
Exception Authority
Risk Acceptance Authority
Change Governance
```

---

## Initial Governance Records

The initial model may use existing repository artifacts such as:

```text
EPIC Documentation
ADR
RFC
Specifications
Quality Rules
Quality Profiles
Gate Configuration
Risk Records
Exception Records
```

A dedicated governance platform is not initially required.

---

## Initial Authority Model

A practical initial model may distinguish:

```text
Repository-Level Decisions
Framework-Level Decisions
Architecture Decisions
Release Decisions
```

As FamilyOS grows, more granular roles may be introduced.

---

## Initial Enforcement

Initial enforcement should prioritize deterministic requirements already supported by the engineering toolchain.

Examples include:

```text
Ruff
MyPy
Pytest
Documentation Validation
Plugin Compliance
Protected Merge Requirements
Release Validation
```

---

## Initial Exception Model

An initial exception record should contain at minimum:

```text
Requirement
Target
Reason
Risk
Authority
Owner
Expiration
```

---

## Initial Governance Review

A practical initial review may occur:

```text
After Major EPIC Completion
After Major Release
After Significant Quality Incident
Before Major Quality Policy Change
```

---

## Governance Maturity Model

Quality Governance may mature through:

```text
Level 1
Informal Quality Decisions

    ↓

Level 2
Documented Quality Standards

    ↓

Level 3
Explicit Ownership and Authority

    ↓

Level 4
Versioned Policy and Automated Enforcement

    ↓

Level 5
Evidence-Based Governance

    ↓

Level 6
Integrated Risk and Compliance Governance

    ↓

Level 7
Adaptive Continuous Quality Governance
```

---

## Adaptive Governance

At high maturity, governance may adapt based on:

```text
Target Criticality
Change Risk
Historical Quality
Operational Outcomes
Compliance History
```

Adaptive governance must remain explicit and explainable.

It must not become opaque automated authority.

---

## AI-Assisted Governance

AI may assist with:

* policy impact analysis;
* governance report summarization;
* conflicting requirement detection;
* exception trend analysis;
* historical decision retrieval;
* improvement recommendations.

---

## AI Governance Restrictions

AI should not independently:

```text
Accept Critical Risk
Approve Significant Exceptions
Override Critical Gates
Create Binding Quality Policy
Retire Mandatory Requirements
Authorize Releases
```

unless future FamilyOS governance explicitly defines such authority.

Human or formally delegated governance authority remains responsible for binding decisions.

---

## Governance Intelligence

At advanced maturity, FamilyOS may use historical governance data to identify:

```text
Frequently Overridden Gates
Frequently Extended Exceptions
Conflicting Requirements
Ineffective Policies
Unowned Quality Areas
Recurring Risk Acceptance
```

These insights should feed Continuous Improvement.

---

## Governance Evolution Strategy

Quality Governance should evolve incrementally:

```text
Documented Authority
      ↓
Explicit Ownership
      ↓
Versioned Policy
      ↓
Automated Enforcement
      ↓
Governance Observability
      ↓
Evidence-Based Reviews
      ↓
Adaptive Governance
```

Complex governance infrastructure should not be introduced before demonstrated need.

---

## Governance Success Criteria

Quality Governance is successful when FamilyOS can answer:

```text
Who owns this quality requirement?

Why does this rule exist?

Which authority approved it?

Which targets does it apply to?

How is compliance verified?

What happens when it fails?

Who may accept the risk?

Who may approve an exception?

Who may override the gate?

How does the policy change?

Can the historical decision be reconstructed?
```

If these questions cannot be answered for important quality controls, governance remains incomplete.

---

## Reference Quality Governance Flow

The complete FamilyOS Quality Governance flow can be represented as:

```text
FamilyOS Vision
      ↓
Engineering Constitution
      ↓
Architecture / Engineering Governance
      ↓
Quality Governance
      ↓
Quality Policy
      ↓
Quality Requirements
      ↓
Quality Profiles
      ↓
Quality Rules
      ↓
Verification
      ↓
Quality Evidence
      ↓
Quality Findings
      ↓
Quality Assessments
      ↓
Quality Risk / Debt / Compliance
      ↓
Quality Gates
      ↓
Engineering Progression
      ↓
Operational Outcomes
      ↓
Quality Observability
      ↓
Quality Reviews
      ↓
Continuous Improvement
      ↓
Policy / Rule / Gate / Framework Evolution
      ↓
Quality Governance
```

This creates a closed governance feedback system.

---

## Strategic Outcome

Quality Governance enables FamilyOS to move from:

```text
We have quality standards.

Developers generally know what they are.

The CI pipeline checks some of them.

Exceptions are handled when necessary.

Release decisions are made based on experience.
```

toward:

```text
FamilyOS quality expectations originate from
explicit authoritative sources.

Every significant requirement has ownership.

Quality policy is versioned and traceable.

Deterministic requirements are automated where practical.

Risks, debt, exceptions, and overrides are explicitly governed.

Quality Assessments provide authoritative quality state.

Quality Gates enforce progression policy.

Governance decisions remain reconstructable.

Engineering outcomes continuously improve future policy.
```

This transforms quality from a collection of engineering practices into an institutional capability.

---

## Final Quality Governance Principle

Quality cannot remain sustainable when authority, responsibility, exceptions, risk acceptance, enforcement, and policy evolution are implicit.

FamilyOS therefore requires a governance model that connects engineering authority with quality requirements, evidence, decisions, enforcement, accountability, and continuous learning.

The Quality Governance model establishes the relationship:

```text
Authority
      ↓
Policy
      ↓
Requirement
      ↓
Verification
      ↓
Evidence
      ↓
Assessment
      ↓
Decision
      ↓
Enforcement
      ↓
Observation
      ↓
Learning
      ↓
Policy Evolution
```

Through explicit ownership, federated authority, versioned policy, requirement governance, rule governance, risk management, Quality Debt governance, controlled exceptions, auditable overrides, Quality Gates, compliance, automation, observability, proportional escalation, and continuous improvement, Quality Governance provides FamilyOS with the institutional structure required to preserve engineering quality as the platform grows in scope, complexity, capability, and lifetime.
