# Quality Framework

**EPIC-QLT-001**

Version: **1.0.0**

Status: **Draft**

Owner: **FamilyOS Engineering**

---

## Overview

The FamilyOS Quality Framework establishes the authoritative engineering foundation for defining, evaluating, evidencing, governing, automating, observing, and continuously improving quality across the FamilyOS ecosystem.

Quality is treated as a permanent engineering capability rather than a final verification activity.

The framework integrates quality throughout:

* architecture;
* source code;
* testing;
* documentation;
* dependencies;
* build;
* release;
* plugins;
* compliance;
* governance;
* engineering operations.

The objective is to make FamilyOS quality:

```text
Defined
   ↓
Measurable
   ↓
Evidence-Based
   ↓
Automatable
   ↓
Explainable
   ↓
Governed
   ↓
Continuously Improved
```

---

## Purpose

The Quality Framework provides a common engineering model for determining:

* what quality means within FamilyOS;
* which quality expectations apply;
* how those expectations are represented;
* how quality is verified;
* what evidence supports a quality decision;
* how findings are classified;
* how quality state is assessed;
* how risks, defects, and quality debt are managed;
* how quality gates influence engineering progression;
* how exceptions are governed;
* how quality evolves over time.

The framework provides the common quality layer connecting multiple FamilyOS engineering capabilities.

---

## Strategic Objective

The strategic objective of EPIC-QLT-001 is to move FamilyOS from independent quality tools and practices toward a coherent engineering quality system.

Conceptually:

```text
Individual Tools
      ↓
Structured Verification
      ↓
Quality Evidence
      ↓
Quality Findings
      ↓
Quality Assessment
      ↓
Quality Gates
      ↓
Quality Governance
      ↓
Continuous Improvement
```

Tools remain responsible for their specialized verification capabilities.

The Quality Framework provides the common semantics, evidence model, assessment model, governance model, and integration architecture surrounding those capabilities.

---

## Core Principles

The framework is based on several foundational principles.

### Quality Is Continuous

Quality is integrated throughout the engineering lifecycle.

It is not postponed until release preparation.

---

### Quality Is Evidence-Based

Authoritative quality decisions should be supported by verifiable evidence.

A successful command alone is not sufficient when the underlying evidence cannot be identified or reproduced.

---

### Quality Is Explainable

Quality findings, assessments, and gates should explain:

```text
What happened?
Why did it happen?
Which requirement applies?
Which evidence supports the result?
What action is required?
```

---

### Quality Is Governed

Quality requirements, rules, profiles, gates, exceptions, and lifecycle changes require explicit authority and ownership.

---

### Quality Is Risk-Aware

Quality decisions should consider engineering risk rather than relying exclusively on binary technical checks.

---

### Quality Is Automatable

Deterministic verification should be automated whenever doing so improves reliability, reproducibility, and engineering feedback.

---

### Prevention Before Detection

The framework prefers preventing quality problems through architecture, standards, automation, and early feedback rather than discovering them late in the lifecycle.

---

### Progressive Enforcement

New controls should generally progress through:

```text
Definition
   ↓
Observation
   ↓
Non-Blocking Validation
   ↓
Blocking Enforcement
```

This reduces disruption and allows controls to demonstrate reliability before becoming authoritative gates.

---

## Quality Model

The framework introduces a common conceptual model around entities such as:

```text
QualityRequirement
QualityRule
QualityProfile
QualityTarget
QualityFinding
QualityEvidence
QualityAssessment
QualityMetric
QualityRisk
QualityDefect
QualityDebt
QualityGate
QualityException
```

These concepts allow different quality capabilities to participate in a coherent engineering model without requiring all tools to use identical internal implementations.

---

## Quality Domains

Quality is evaluated across multiple engineering domains.

Initial domains include:

* architecture;
* source code;
* static analysis;
* typing;
* testing;
* documentation;
* dependencies;
* build;
* release;
* security;
* plugins;
* compliance;
* governance.

Additional domains may be introduced through governed framework evolution.

---

## Quality Evidence

Quality Evidence provides the traceable foundation for assessments and decisions.

Evidence should be:

```text
Structured
Reproducible
Traceable
Revision-Aware
Machine-Readable
Attributable
```

Examples may include:

* static analysis results;
* type-checking results;
* test results;
* documentation validation results;
* architecture validation;
* plugin compliance results;
* build verification;
* manual review evidence.

---

## Quality Assessment

Quality assessments combine applicable expectations, verification results, findings, and evidence into an explainable quality state.

A simplified progression is:

```text
Quality Target
      ↓
Quality Profile
      ↓
Applicable Rules
      ↓
Verification
      ↓
Evidence
      ↓
Findings
      ↓
Quality Assessment
```

Assessments provide the foundation for higher-level engineering decisions.

---

## Quality Gates

Quality Gates determine whether an engineering target may progress through a controlled lifecycle transition.

Examples may eventually include:

* merge readiness;
* build readiness;
* release readiness;
* plugin compliance readiness.

Quality gates use progressive enforcement.

A control should not normally become blocking before its reliability and operational impact are understood.

---

## Quality Risk

Not every significant quality concern can be represented by a deterministic rule.

The framework therefore defines Quality Risk as a first-class concept.

Quality Risk supports:

* identification;
* evaluation;
* ownership;
* mitigation;
* monitoring;
* escalation;
* acceptance where authorized;
* closure.

---

## Defects and Quality Debt

The framework distinguishes between defects and quality debt.

A defect represents an observed deficiency requiring correction.

Quality debt represents a known quality deficiency or compromise whose remediation has been intentionally deferred or accumulated over time.

Both require visibility, ownership, traceability, and controlled lifecycle management.

---

## Quality Compliance

Compliance evaluates whether applicable quality requirements have been satisfied.

Compliance should remain traceable to:

```text
Requirement
   ↓
Rule
   ↓
Evidence
   ↓
Finding
   ↓
Compliance Result
```

Missing mandatory evidence must not silently become compliance.

---

## Quality Exceptions

Exceptions provide a governed mechanism for handling situations where an authoritative quality expectation cannot temporarily be satisfied.

An exception should define:

* scope;
* reason;
* affected requirement;
* target;
* owner;
* approving authority;
* risk;
* expiration.

Exceptions must never become an invisible mechanism for suppressing quality failures.

---

## Quality Automation

Automation transforms deterministic quality requirements into repeatable engineering verification.

The framework initially anticipates integration with existing FamilyOS tooling such as:

```text
Ruff
MyPy
Pytest
```

The Quality Framework does not replace these tools.

It integrates their results into a common quality model.

---

## Local and CI Consistency

A fundamental automation objective is:

```text
Local Quality Logic
        =
CI Quality Logic
```

Developers should be able to reproduce quality failures locally whenever reasonably possible.

CI should not implement a separate hidden quality policy.

---

## Quality Observability

Quality state should not exist only inside ephemeral command output or CI logs.

The framework defines observability principles for understanding:

* current quality state;
* historical assessments;
* significant findings;
* gate failures;
* automation errors;
* quality trends;
* execution duration;
* recurring quality problems.

---

## Continuous Improvement

The Quality Framework is designed to improve the engineering system itself.

Recurring problems should be capable of producing systemic improvements.

Conceptually:

```text
Finding
   ↓
Analysis
   ↓
Root Cause
   ↓
Improvement
   ↓
Validation
   ↓
Updated Engineering Control
```

This may result in:

* new tests;
* improved documentation;
* architecture constraints;
* new quality rules;
* automation improvements;
* revised quality profiles;
* governance changes.

---

## Framework Governance

Quality Governance defines:

* authority;
* ownership;
* policy management;
* rule governance;
* profile governance;
* gate governance;
* exception authority;
* escalation;
* framework evolution.

Quality controls that influence authoritative engineering decisions must remain governed and traceable.

---

## Framework Lifecycle

The Quality Framework itself has a lifecycle.

It may evolve through:

```text
Proposal
   ↓
Definition
   ↓
Validation
   ↓
Adoption
   ↓
Operation
   ↓
Evolution
   ↓
Deprecation
   ↓
Retirement
```

Rules, profiles, gates, and other framework capabilities may also have governed lifecycle states.

---

## Documentation Structure

EPIC-QLT-001 contains exactly **26 canonical numbered documents**, from `00` through `25`.

## Control Documents

The numbered framework documents are complemented by the following control artifacts:

```text
EPIC-QLT-001.md
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

Together:

```text
26 numbered documents
+
7 control documents
=
33 canonical EPIC files
```

`MANIFEST.md` is the authoritative human-readable structural inventory.

`EPIC.yaml` provides the corresponding machine-readable EPIC metadata and structural definition.

---

## Framework Relationships

The Quality Framework operates as part of the broader FamilyOS Engineering Platform.

### EPIC-ENG-001 — Engineering Foundation

Provides the foundational engineering principles and architectural environment within which quality operates.

---

### EPIC-TST-001 — Testing Framework

Defines authoritative testing architecture, practices, levels, execution, and evidence.

Testing remains responsible for testing semantics.

The Quality Framework consumes testing evidence for broader quality assessment.

---

### EPIC-DOC-001 — Documentation Framework

Defines authoritative documentation architecture, standards, lifecycle, validation, quality, and governance.

The Quality Framework may consume documentation validation evidence.

---

### EPIC-BLD-001 — Build Framework

Defines reproducible build capabilities and provides build evidence that may participate in quality assessments and gates.

---

### EPIC-REL-001 — Release Framework

Defines release governance and lifecycle.

Quality assessments and release quality gates may provide inputs into release decisions.

---

### EPIC-PLUGIN-002 — Plugin Compliance Framework

Defines authoritative compliance requirements for FamilyOS plugins.

The Quality Framework consumes plugin compliance evidence where applicable rather than recreating plugin compliance rules.

---

## Architectural Boundary

The Quality Framework coordinates quality without absorbing the responsibilities of neighboring frameworks.

Conceptually:

```text
Testing Framework
        ↓
Testing Evidence
        │
Documentation Framework
        ↓
Documentation Evidence
        │
Plugin Compliance Framework
        ↓
Compliance Evidence
        │
        ▼
Quality Framework
        ↓
Unified Quality Assessment
        ↓
Quality Gates / Governance
```

This preserves clear framework boundaries.

---

## Implementation Strategy

The framework should be implemented progressively.

The recommended high-level sequence is:

```text
Normative Framework
      ↓
Core Quality Models
      ↓
Quality Evidence
      ↓
Tool Adapters
      ↓
Quality Assessment
      ↓
Quality Profiles
      ↓
CLI Integration
      ↓
CI Integration
      ↓
Quality Gates
      ↓
Risk / Debt / Compliance
      ↓
Observability
      ↓
Governance
      ↓
Continuous Improvement
      ↓
Quality Intelligence
```

The complete implementation progression is defined in:

`25-Implementation-Checklist.md`

---

## Initial Executable Scope

The recommended first executable implementation should remain deliberately limited.

Initial concepts:

```text
QualitySeverity
QualityStatus
QualityTarget
QualityFinding
QualityEvidence
QualityAssessment
```

Initial integrations:

```text
Ruff
MyPy
Pytest
```

Initial interfaces may include:

```text
familyos quality check
familyos quality assess
```

This provides useful quality infrastructure without prematurely introducing a centralized quality platform.

---

## Advanced Capabilities

Advanced capabilities may eventually include:

* historical quality intelligence;
* cross-repository quality analysis;
* automated regression analysis;
* quality trend detection;
* predictive risk analysis;
* AI-assisted quality investigation.

These capabilities are not prerequisites for the initial framework implementation.

Deterministic quality foundations must come first.

---

## AI and Quality Authority

AI may eventually assist with:

* summarizing assessments;
* explaining findings;
* identifying recurring patterns;
* clustering related failures;
* suggesting investigation paths;
* summarizing historical trends.

AI SHALL NOT become an invisible source of authoritative quality decisions.

Authoritative quality decisions must remain grounded in governed requirements, deterministic evidence, explicit policy, and accountable human authority where required.

---

## Validation

The Quality Framework must validate itself before becoming authoritative.

Validation includes:

* structural completeness;
* canonical numbering;
* absence of duplicate document numbers;
* absence of empty required documents;
* terminology consistency;
* cross-document consistency;
* dependency alignment;
* governance consistency;
* framework boundary consistency;
* control document synchronization.

The normative validation model is defined in:

`22-Validation.md`

Actual release validation evidence is recorded in:

`VALIDATION.md`

---

## Current Status

```text
Identifier: EPIC-QLT-001
Version:    1.0.0
Status:     Completed
Owner:      FamilyOS Engineering
Language:   English
```

The normative framework documentation is structurally established.

Control artifacts are maintained separately and must remain synchronized before release.

---

## Expected Outcomes

When progressively implemented, the Quality Framework should enable FamilyOS to:

* define explicit quality expectations;
* evaluate targets consistently;
* collect structured evidence;
* generate actionable findings;
* produce reproducible assessments;
* manage quality risks;
* track defects and quality debt;
* evaluate compliance;
* enforce quality gates;
* integrate quality into CI;
* observe quality evolution;
* govern exceptions;
* support continuous improvement.

---

## Long-Term Direction

The long-term objective is not merely to accumulate more quality checks.

The objective is to establish a coherent engineering capability in which:

```text
Requirements
      ↓
Rules
      ↓
Verification
      ↓
Evidence
      ↓
Findings
      ↓
Assessment
      ↓
Decision
      ↓
Improvement
```

remain traceable and understandable.
