# Quality Framework

## 14 Quality Observability

### Overview

The FamilyOS Quality Observability model defines how the state, behavior, evolution, reliability, and effectiveness of quality across the FamilyOS engineering ecosystem are made visible through structured signals.

Quality Observability transforms quality from a collection of isolated validation results into an continuously understandable engineering state.

It provides the mechanisms required to answer questions such as:

```text
What is the current quality state?

Where is quality degrading?

Which risks are increasing?

Which quality controls are unreliable?

Where is quality debt accumulating?

Which components require attention?

Are releases becoming more reliable?

Is the Quality Framework itself effective?
```

Quality Observability combines:

* quality evidence;
* quality findings;
* quality metrics;
* defects;
* quality debt;
* quality risks;
* assessment results;
* gate decisions;
* automation telemetry;
* operational quality signals;
* historical trends.

The objective is not merely to collect information.

The objective is to create actionable engineering visibility.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of Quality Observability is to make quality state continuously understandable.

Without observability, quality information tends to remain fragmented:

```text
CI Logs
Test Reports
Static Analysis
Security Reports
Architecture Findings
Documentation Checks
Release Reports
Incident Records
```

Each source provides useful information, but no single source explains the complete quality state.

The desired model is:

```text
Distributed Quality Signals
          ↓
Normalization
          ↓
Quality Telemetry
          ↓
Aggregation
          ↓
Quality State
          ↓
Trends
          ↓
Engineering Insight
          ↓
Action
```

Quality Observability therefore provides the visibility layer of the Quality Framework.

---

## Foundational Principle

The foundational principle is:

> Important quality conditions must be observable enough to support timely, evidence-based engineering decisions.

A quality requirement that cannot be observed may still exist, but its effectiveness becomes difficult to evaluate.

Observability should therefore accompany quality controls wherever practical.

---

## Quality Observability Definition

Quality Observability is the capability to infer and understand the quality state of FamilyOS from available engineering signals.

Conceptually:

```text
Quality Signals
      ↓
Interpretation
      ↓
Quality State Understanding
```

It is broader than metrics.

Metrics are one source of observability.

---

## Observability vs Monitoring

Monitoring and observability are related but distinct.

Monitoring answers predefined questions such as:

```text
Did the test suite fail?

Did the release gate pass?

Are Critical findings present?
```

Observability supports broader investigation:

```text
Why is release quality declining?

Which subsystem is causing instability?

Why are quality gates taking longer?

Where is quality debt growing?
```

Monitoring is therefore one capability within Quality Observability.

---

## Observability vs Metrics

Metrics provide measurements.

Observability combines measurements with context, relationships, history, and interpretation.

For example:

```text
Metric:
Integration test failure rate = 8%
```

Observability adds:

```text
The increase began after changes to the plugin runtime.

Most failures affect communication and documents plugins.

Three failures share the same dependency boundary.
```

The second form provides greater engineering value.

---

## Quality Signal

A Quality Signal is any structured information that contributes to understanding quality state.

Examples include:

```text
Test Result
Static Analysis Finding
Architecture Violation
Security Finding
Documentation Failure
Quality Metric
Defect
Risk
Quality Debt
Gate Decision
Incident
Automation Error
```

Signals may be positive, negative, or neutral.

---

## Positive Quality Signals

Positive signals demonstrate expected quality behavior.

Examples include:

* successful required tests;
* stable architecture checks;
* successful release validation;
* declining defect escape rate;
* decreasing high-risk debt.

Positive signals are important because observability should represent confidence as well as problems.

---

## Negative Quality Signals

Negative signals indicate potential quality degradation.

Examples include:

```text
New Critical Finding
Increasing Flaky Tests
Expired Exception
Rising Architecture Debt
Failed Release Gate
Repeated Production Incident
```

Negative signals should be prioritized according to risk.

---

## Neutral Quality Signals

Some signals provide context without directly representing success or failure.

Examples include:

* execution duration;
* test count;
* dependency count;
* repository size;
* change volume.

These may become meaningful when correlated with other signals.

---

## Quality Telemetry

Quality Telemetry is the structured stream of information produced by quality activities.

It may include:

```text
Metrics
Events
Evidence
Findings
Assessment States
Gate Decisions
Automation Health
```

Telemetry should use stable identities where possible.

---

## Observability Architecture

A conceptual Quality Observability architecture is:

```text
Engineering Activities
        ↓
Quality Automation
        ↓
Quality Evidence
        ↓
Findings / Metrics / Events
        ↓
Quality Telemetry
        ↓
Aggregation
        ↓
Quality State Store
        ↓
Dashboards / Reports / Alerts / Queries
        ↓
Engineering Decisions
```

This architecture should remain decoupled from individual quality tools.

---

## Observability Sources

Quality Observability may consume information from:

```text
Source Repository
CI
Testing Framework
Quality Automation
Build Framework
Release Framework
Documentation Framework
Plugin Compliance Framework
Security Controls
Operational Systems
Incident Management
```

The Quality Framework provides normalization and interpretation.

---

## Quality Event

A Quality Event represents a meaningful change in quality state.

Examples include:

```text
quality.finding.created
quality.finding.resolved
quality.risk.created
quality.risk.escalated
quality.defect.closed
quality.debt.created
quality.assessment.completed
quality.gate.failed
quality.exception.expired
quality.automation.degraded
```

Events support continuous observability.

---

## Event Metadata

A Quality Event may contain:

```text
event_id
event_type
timestamp
target
domain
source
severity
related_entity
revision
metadata
```

The exact schema may evolve.

---

## Event Identity

Events should have stable unique identifiers where persistence is required.

Conceptually:

```text
QLT-EVENT-<IDENTIFIER>
```

This enables traceability between events and quality state changes.

---

## Event Ordering

Where ordering matters, events should preserve sufficient timing and sequence information.

This supports reconstruction such as:

```text
Finding Created
      ↓
Risk Escalated
      ↓
Gate Failed
      ↓
Defect Remediated
      ↓
Assessment Passed
```

---

## Event Idempotency

If events may be processed multiple times, consumers should avoid duplicate state changes.

Stable event identity can support idempotent processing.

---

## Quality State

Quality State represents the current interpreted condition of a target.

A target may have states across multiple dimensions:

```text
Correctness
Architecture
Security
Reliability
Testing
Documentation
Dependencies
Build
Compliance
```

The complete state should preserve these dimensions.

---

## Target Quality State

A target quality state may conceptually contain:

```text
target
revision
profile
assessment_state
domain_states
open_findings
open_risks
quality_debt
gate_state
last_updated
```

This provides a consolidated view.

---

## Quality State Timeline

Quality state should be observable over time.

Example:

```text
Release 4.0
PASS

Release 4.1
PASS

Release 4.2
PASS_WITH_WARNINGS

Release 4.3
FAIL

Release 4.4
PASS
```

Historical context helps distinguish temporary events from systemic trends.

---

## Quality Timeline

A quality timeline may combine events:

```text
09:00  Commit created
09:02  Static checks PASS
09:05  Unit tests PASS
09:11  Integration tests FAIL
09:12  HIGH finding created
09:14  Quality assessment FAIL
09:15  Merge gate blocked
```

This enables rapid investigation.

---

## Quality Metrics

Quality Metrics provide quantitative observability.

Examples include:

```text
Defect Count
Finding Count
Risk Count
Debt Count
Coverage
Test Duration
Failure Rate
Gate Failure Rate
Automation Error Rate
Assessment Duration
```

Metric definitions belong to the Quality Metrics model.

Quality Observability defines how those metrics are exposed and interpreted.

---

## Metric Dimensions

Metrics should support useful dimensions such as:

```text
Repository
Plugin
Component
Domain
Profile
Rule
Release
Branch
Severity
Time
```

Dimensions enable investigation without creating separate metrics for every target.

---

## Metric Labels

Labels or dimensions should remain controlled.

Unbounded dimensions may create excessive telemetry cardinality.

For example, using arbitrary error messages as metric labels should generally be avoided.

---

## Quality Indicators

A Quality Indicator is a metric or derived signal used to understand a meaningful quality condition.

Examples include:

```text
Open Critical Risk Count
High-Risk Debt Age
Defect Escape Rate
Flaky Test Rate
Gate Reliability
Evidence Completeness
```

Indicators should correspond to engineering decisions.

---

## Leading Indicators

Leading indicators may reveal future quality degradation before major failures occur.

Examples include:

* increasing architecture violations;
* declining test stability;
* growing dependency age;
* increasing manual exceptions;
* rising automation errors.

Leading indicators support prevention.

---

## Lagging Indicators

Lagging indicators describe quality outcomes that have already occurred.

Examples include:

* production incidents;
* escaped defects;
* failed releases;
* rollback frequency.

Lagging indicators remain important for validating whether earlier quality controls were effective.

---

## Leading and Lagging Balance

A mature observability model should combine:

```text
Leading Indicators
      +
Lagging Indicators
```

Only observing incidents provides feedback too late.

Only observing internal quality metrics may miss actual operational outcomes.

---

## Quality Trends

A trend represents change over time.

Examples include:

```text
Open Defects
12 → 10 → 8 → 5

Architecture Debt
3 → 5 → 8 → 14

Flaky Tests
1 → 1 → 2 → 7
```

Trends often provide more value than isolated values.

---

## Trend Direction

A trend may be classified conceptually as:

```text
IMPROVING
STABLE
DEGRADING
UNKNOWN
```

Classification should be based on defined evidence rather than subjective interpretation.

---

## Trend Window

Trend interpretation depends on the observation window.

Examples include:

```text
Last 7 Days
Last 30 Days
Last 5 Releases
Last 100 Changes
```

Different windows may reveal different behavior.

---

## Baseline Comparison

Observability may compare current state against a baseline.

Example:

```text
Baseline Architecture Violations:
42

Current:
31

Change:
-11
```

This provides visibility into quality debt reduction.

---

## Release Comparison

Quality may be compared between releases.

Example:

```text
                     v4.1    v4.2

Critical Findings      0       0
High Findings          3       1
Open Risks             5       3
Quality Debt          18      14
Escaped Defects        4       2
```

Release comparison supports continuous improvement.

---

## Component Comparison

Components may also be compared.

Comparison should be used carefully because components may have different:

* criticality;
* complexity;
* maturity;
* quality profiles.

Raw ranking can create misleading conclusions.

---

## Quality Dashboard

A Quality Dashboard provides consolidated visibility into quality state.

A repository-level dashboard may display:

```text
FamilyOS Quality State

Overall Assessment       PASS_WITH_WARNINGS

Correctness              PASS
Architecture             PASS
Testing                  PASS
Security                 PASS
Documentation            WARNING
Dependencies             PASS

Critical Findings        0
High Findings            1

Critical Risks           0
High Risks               1

Quality Debt             14

Automation Health        HEALTHY
```

The dashboard should support drill-down.

---

## Dashboard Principle

Dashboards must summarize.

They must not hide underlying evidence.

Conceptually:

```text
Dashboard
      ↓
Assessment
      ↓
Finding
      ↓
Evidence
```

Every important conclusion should remain traceable.

---

## Domain Dashboard

Quality dashboards may provide domain views.

Example:

```text
Architecture Quality

Open Violations:          4
New Violations:           0
Resolved This Release:    3
High-Risk Debt:           1
Trend:                    IMPROVING
```

---

## Plugin Dashboard

An official plugin dashboard may include:

```text
Plugin:
Communication

Assessment:
PASS

Compliance:
PASS

Tests:
PASS

Architecture:
PASS

Documentation:
PASS

Open Findings:
2 LOW

Open Risks:
0 HIGH / CRITICAL
```

---

## Release Dashboard

A release dashboard may display:

```text
Release Candidate:
v5.0.0

Release Assessment:
PASS_WITH_WARNINGS

Blocking Findings:
0

Critical Risks:
0

High Risks:
1 accepted

Quality Debt Added:
2

Quality Debt Resolved:
6

Release Gate:
PASS
```

---

## Quality Control Plane Dashboard

The Quality Framework itself should have observability.

Example:

```text
Quality Automation Health

Checks Executed:          128
Automation Errors:          2
Evidence Failures:          0
Flaky Checks:               1
Gate Evaluation Errors:     0
```

This helps detect degradation of the quality system.

---

## Quality Query Model

Observability should eventually support structured queries.

Examples include:

```text
Show all Critical findings.

Show High risks older than 30 days.

Show plugins with increasing quality debt.

Show failed release assessments.

Show architecture violations introduced this release.

Show expired exceptions.

Show unreliable quality checks.
```

Queryable quality data enables investigation beyond dashboards.

---

## Drill-Down

Observability should support progressive drill-down.

Example:

```text
Repository
      ↓
Plugin
      ↓
Domain
      ↓
Rule
      ↓
Finding
      ↓
Evidence
```

This enables both executive and engineering views without losing detail.

---

## Traceability View

A traceability query may answer:

```text
Why did this release gate fail?
```

with:

```text
Release Gate FAIL
      ↓
Release Assessment FAIL
      ↓
Security Domain FAIL
      ↓
QLT-FIND-SEC-018
      ↓
QLT-RULE-SEC-004
      ↓
QLT-EVID-882A
```

This is a core observability capability.

---

## Finding Observability

Findings should be observable by:

* status;
* severity;
* domain;
* age;
* target;
* source;
* owner.

Useful views include:

```text
New Findings
Open Critical Findings
Oldest High Findings
Recurring Findings
```

---

## Finding Trend

Finding count alone can be misleading.

For example:

```text
Release A:
20 LOW findings

Release B:
3 CRITICAL findings
```

Release B may represent significantly worse quality despite fewer findings.

Severity and risk must remain visible.

---

## Defect Observability

Defect observability should expose:

```text
Open Defects
New Defects
Resolved Defects
Defect Age
Recurring Defects
Escaped Defects
```

Root cause dimensions may provide additional insight.

---

## Defect Flow

A defect flow view may show:

```text
Created
   ↓
Triaged
   ↓
Assigned
   ↓
Resolved
   ↓
Verified
   ↓
Closed
```

Bottlenecks become visible through state duration.

---

## Quality Debt Observability

Quality Debt should be observable by:

```text
Domain
Risk
Age
Owner
Status
Interest
Release
```

The most important question is not merely:

```text
How much debt exists?
```

but:

```text
Which debt threatens sustainable evolution?
```

---

## Debt Trend

A debt trend may show:

```text
Release 1      48
Release 2      44
Release 3      39
Release 4      35
```

This indicates reduction.

However, risk distribution should also be considered.

---

## Debt Creation vs Remediation

A useful view is:

```text
Debt Added      8
Debt Resolved  14
Net Change     -6
```

This helps evaluate whether quality debt is being controlled.

---

## Risk Observability

Risk observability should expose:

```text
Open Risks
Risk Severity
Risk Age
Risk Domain
Risk Owner
Residual Risk
Risk Trend
```

Critical and High risks require prominent visibility.

---

## Risk Heat Map

A risk heat map may visualize:

```text
Likelihood
      ×
Impact
```

Heat maps should support drill-down to individual risk records.

---

## Risk Trend

Risk trend may show:

```text
Critical   1 → 0 → 0
High       7 → 5 → 3
Medium    12 → 13 → 11
```

This provides insight into risk management effectiveness.

---

## Exception Observability

Quality exceptions should be observable.

Important views include:

```text
Active Exceptions
Expiring Exceptions
Expired Exceptions
Exceptions by Rule
Exceptions by Owner
```

Exceptions should not disappear from quality visibility simply because they suppress a gate condition.

---

## Exception Aging

Long-lived exceptions may indicate hidden quality debt.

Example:

```text
Exception Age:
210 days
```

This should trigger review according to governance policy.

---

## Suppression Observability

Local suppressions may also be monitored.

A growing suppression count may indicate:

* rule quality problems;
* legacy debt;
* developer resistance;
* architecture mismatch.

Suppression trends can therefore reveal systemic quality issues.

---

## Assessment Observability

Assessments should be observable by:

```text
Quality State
Target
Profile
Revision
Domain
Duration
Completeness
```

Historical assessment state supports trend analysis.

---

## Assessment Failure Trend

Repeated assessment failure in the same domain may indicate structural problems.

Example:

```text
Documentation Assessment

PASS
WARNING
WARNING
FAIL
FAIL
```

This trend deserves attention even before release failure occurs.

---

## Gate Observability

Quality Gates should expose:

```text
Gate Result
Gate Type
Failure Reason
Target
Assessment
Blocking Findings
Exceptions
Duration
```

This enables analysis of engineering flow.

---

## Gate Failure Rate

A metric may track:

```text
Gate Failure Rate
=
Failed Gate Evaluations
/
Total Gate Evaluations
```

High failure rate is not automatically bad.

It may indicate effective early detection.

Interpretation requires context.

---

## Repeated Gate Failure

Repeated failures for the same rule may indicate:

* missing developer guidance;
* inadequate automation feedback;
* systemic architecture debt;
* rule misconfiguration.

Observability should support root cause investigation.

---

## Automation Observability

Quality Automation must expose its own health.

Useful signals include:

```text
Execution Duration
Queue Time
Error Rate
Timeout Rate
Retry Rate
Flaky Rate
Cache Hit Rate
Evidence Generation Rate
```

---

## Automation Failure Observability

Automation failures should be classified separately from quality failures.

Example:

```text
Quality Failures:
14

Automation Errors:
3
```

This distinction protects interpretation.

---

## Tool Reliability

Tool reliability may be measured by:

```text
Successful Executions
Errors
Crashes
Invalid Outputs
Timeouts
```

An unreliable quality tool should not remain silently authoritative.

---

## Check Reliability

A check may be considered unreliable when identical inputs frequently produce different results.

This is particularly relevant for flaky tests.

---

## Flaky Test Observability

Flaky tests should be visible through signals such as:

```text
Test Name
Failure Frequency
Retry Success Rate
Affected Platforms
Age
Owner
```

This allows systematic remediation.

---

## Test Observability

Testing observability may include:

```text
Test Count
Pass Rate
Failure Rate
Duration
Flaky Tests
Skipped Tests
Coverage
Test Distribution
```

The Testing Framework remains authoritative for testing semantics.

---

## Skipped Test Observability

Skipped tests should be visible.

A growing skipped-test count may indicate hidden testing debt.

Required tests must not silently become permanently skipped.

---

## Test Duration Trend

Increasing test duration may create engineering productivity risk.

Example:

```text
Month 1   45 seconds
Month 2   62 seconds
Month 3   95 seconds
Month 4  160 seconds
```

This trend may justify test performance optimization.

---

## Coverage Observability

Coverage should be observed as a trend and contextual indicator.

Example:

```text
Core Domain Coverage

94%
94%
93%
89%
```

A declining trend may warrant investigation even if a minimum threshold has not yet failed.

---

## Architecture Observability

Architecture quality should be observable through:

```text
Boundary Violations
Dependency Cycles
Architecture Debt
Rule Violations
New Violations
Resolved Violations
```

Architecture degradation often occurs gradually, making observability especially important.

---

## Architecture Drift

Architecture drift occurs when implementation increasingly diverges from intended architecture.

A conceptual signal is:

```text
Architecture Violations
      ↑
Over Time
```

Drift should trigger review before it becomes systemic.

---

## Dependency Observability

Dependency quality may expose:

```text
Outdated Dependencies
Unsupported Dependencies
Known Vulnerabilities
Dependency Count
Dependency Changes
```

Dependency trends can reveal maintenance risk.

---

## Dependency Age

Dependency age may be useful where support policy matters.

Age alone should not imply poor quality.

The important condition is whether dependencies remain:

* supported;
* secure;
* compatible;
* maintainable.

---

## Documentation Observability

Documentation quality may expose:

```text
Missing Required Documents
Broken Links
Validation Failures
Stale Documents
Unresolved Documentation Findings
```

This provides visibility into documentation health.

---

## Documentation Drift

Documentation drift occurs when documentation no longer accurately reflects implementation or architecture.

Potential signals include:

* outdated references;
* mismatched identifiers;
* missing changes;
* stale revision metadata.

Automated drift detection should increase over time.

---

## Compliance Observability

Compliance state may be exposed by:

```text
Profile
Rules Evaluated
Passing Rules
Failing Rules
Exceptions
Compliance State
```

This is particularly important for official plugins.

---

## Build Observability

Build quality may include:

```text
Build Success Rate
Build Duration
Artifact Validation
Reproducibility
Dependency Resolution Errors
```

Build degradation may affect release reliability.

---

## Release Observability

Release observability may include:

```text
Release Assessment
Release Gate
Open Risks
Known Defects
Quality Debt
Rollback
Post-Release Defects
```

This connects pre-release quality with operational outcomes.

---

## Post-Release Quality Signals

Important post-release signals include:

```text
Incidents
Regression Reports
Operational Errors
Performance Degradation
Compatibility Failures
Rollback
```

These signals validate whether pre-release quality controls were effective.

---

## Quality Escape

A Quality Escape occurs when a significant defect passes through expected quality controls and is discovered later.

Conceptually:

```text
Defect Introduced
      ↓
Quality Controls
      ↓
Not Detected
      ↓
Release
      ↓
Defect Discovered
```

Escapes should be observable and analyzed.

---

## Escape Analysis

For significant escapes, observability should support questions such as:

```text
Which control should have detected this?

Was the control missing?

Did the control fail?

Was evidence ignored?

Was an exception involved?
```

This supports continuous improvement.

---

## Incident Correlation

Quality observability should connect incidents with relevant historical quality signals.

Example:

```text
Production Incident
      ↓
Related Component
      ↓
Previous Warning
      ↓
Accepted Risk
      ↓
Quality Debt Item
```

This helps evaluate past decisions.

---

## Change Observability

Quality state should be correlated with engineering changes.

Example:

```text
Commit A
      ↓
Architecture Violations +3
      ↓
Assessment WARNING
```

This supports rapid root cause identification.

---

## Change Volume

Large change volume may increase uncertainty.

Observability may expose change size alongside quality signals.

Change volume alone is not a quality metric.

It provides context.

---

## Quality Regression

A Quality Regression occurs when quality state worsens relative to an accepted previous state.

Examples include:

```text
New Architecture Violation
New High-Risk Debt
Coverage Decline
New Flaky Test
Gate Reliability Decline
```

Regression detection should become increasingly automated.

---

## Regression Event

A regression may generate an event such as:

```text
quality.regression.detected
```

with references to:

* previous state;
* current state;
* affected target;
* quality domain.

---

## Quality Improvement

Observability should also identify improvement.

Examples include:

```text
Debt Reduced
Risk Closed
Flaky Test Removed
Architecture Violation Resolved
Test Duration Improved
```

Quality systems should make progress visible.

---

## Improvement Trend

A sustained improvement trend can demonstrate the effectiveness of engineering investment.

Example:

```text
High-Risk Debt

12
9
6
3
1
```

---

## Quality Alerts

Quality Observability may generate alerts for significant conditions.

Examples include:

```text
Critical Risk Created
Critical Finding Created
Release Gate Failed
Quality Automation Unavailable
Exception Expired
High-Risk Debt Overdue
```

Alerts should be reserved for actionable conditions.

---

## Alert Fatigue

Excessive alerts reduce effectiveness.

The framework should avoid alerting on every low-severity event.

Alerting should be:

```text
Risk-Based
Actionable
Owned
Deduplicated
```

---

## Alert Severity

Alert severity may align with quality severity or use a separate operational classification.

The relationship must remain explicit.

---

## Alert Ownership

Every important alert should have an expected responder or ownership domain.

An alert without ownership may remain ignored.

---

## Alert Deduplication

Repeated identical events should not create unnecessary alert storms.

The system may group related signals while preserving event history.

---

## Alert Escalation

Unresolved critical conditions may escalate according to governance policy.

Examples include:

* unresolved Critical risk;
* persistent quality control outage;
* repeated release failure.

---

## Quality Thresholds

Thresholds may trigger warnings or alerts.

Example:

```text
Flaky Test Rate > Threshold
      ↓
Quality Warning
```

Thresholds should be based on engineering needs rather than arbitrary round numbers.

---

## Static Thresholds

Static thresholds define fixed limits.

Example:

```text
Critical Findings > 0
      ↓
Alert
```

They are appropriate for clear quality boundaries.

---

## Dynamic Thresholds

Future observability may use historical baselines to detect unusual changes.

Example:

```text
Integration Test Duration
      ↑ 70% above baseline
      ↓
Potential Performance Regression
```

Dynamic thresholds should remain explainable.

---

## Anomaly Detection

Quality telemetry may eventually support anomaly detection.

Potential anomalies include:

* sudden defect growth;
* unusual test failure patterns;
* abrupt automation slowdown;
* rapid debt increase.

Anomaly detection should initially remain advisory.

---

## Predictive Quality Signals

With sufficient historical data, FamilyOS may eventually identify predictive signals.

Examples include:

```text
Rapid Change Frequency
+
Increasing Complexity
+
Declining Test Stability
      ↓
Elevated Regression Risk
```

Predictive signals must remain evidence-based and explainable.

---

## Quality Forecasting

A mature system may estimate future quality pressure.

For example:

```text
Current Debt Growth
+
Planned Architecture Changes
+
Dependency End-of-Support
      ↓
Future Maintenance Risk
```

Forecasts should support planning, not replace engineering judgment.

---

## Quality SLOs

FamilyOS may eventually define Quality Service Level Objectives for the quality system itself.

Examples may concern:

* automation reliability;
* evidence availability;
* feedback latency;
* gate evaluation availability.

These are different from product runtime SLOs.

---

## Quality Automation Availability

A possible quality control objective may be:

```text
Required Quality Automation
      ↓
Available when engineering progression requires it
```

Exact numerical objectives should be defined only when operational experience justifies them.

---

## Feedback Latency Observability

Feedback latency may be measured as:

```text
Quality Feedback Latency
=
Time Feedback Available
-
Time Change Submitted
```

This can reveal workflow bottlenecks.

---

## Assessment Latency

Assessment latency measures how long it takes to produce a quality state once required evidence begins processing.

Increasing latency may reduce developer productivity.

---

## Gate Latency

Gate latency measures the time between readiness for evaluation and gate decision.

This helps distinguish slow checks from slow orchestration.

---

## Quality Pipeline Duration

Pipeline duration should be decomposable.

Example:

```text
Total: 12m

Setup:             1m
Static Analysis:   1m
Unit Tests:        2m
Integration:       6m
Assessment:       30s
Gate:              5s
Other:            25s
```

This enables targeted optimization.

---

## Bottleneck Detection

Quality Observability should reveal bottlenecks.

Examples include:

```text
CI Queue
Integration Tests
Artifact Upload
Dependency Installation
Assessment Aggregation
```

Optimization should focus on measured bottlenecks.

---

## Quality Cost Observability

Quality automation consumes engineering resources.

Potential observable costs include:

```text
Compute Time
Storage
CI Minutes
Engineer Review Time
Manual Verification Time
```

Cost should be considered alongside quality benefit.

---

## Quality Efficiency

A mature system may evaluate quality efficiency as the relationship between:

```text
Engineering Assurance
      vs
Quality Control Cost
```

This should not become a simplistic single ratio.

The objective is sustainable assurance.

---

## Manual Work Observability

Repeated manual quality work should be visible.

Examples include:

* manual release verification;
* repeated architecture inspection;
* manual documentation checks.

This helps identify Automation Debt.

---

## Review Observability

Human review activity may expose:

```text
Review Type
Duration
Findings
Repeated Findings
Approval State
```

Metrics should improve review processes without creating incentives for superficial review.

---

## Review Bottlenecks

Observability may reveal:

```text
Architecture Reviews Waiting
Security Reviews Waiting
Release Approvals Waiting
```

This can support governance capacity planning.

---

## Governance Observability

Quality governance should itself be observable.

Potential signals include:

```text
Open Exceptions
Expired Exceptions
Unowned Risks
Unowned Debt
Overdue Reviews
Manual Overrides
Policy Changes
```

Governance failures can create systemic quality risk.

---

## Override Observability

Manual assessment or gate overrides should be highly visible.

A view may show:

```text
Override
Original State
New State
Authority
Reason
Associated Risk
Expiration
```

Silent overrides are prohibited.

---

## Policy Change Observability

Changes to:

* Quality Rules;
* Quality Profiles;
* thresholds;
* gate policies;
* severity mappings;

should be observable.

This allows teams to explain why quality results changed even when source code did not.

---

## Rule Observability

Each rule may expose:

```text
Execution Count
Failure Count
Finding Count
False Positive Reports
Suppression Count
Average Duration
```

This supports rule effectiveness analysis.

---

## Rule Failure Rate

A high rule failure rate may indicate:

* widespread quality problems;
* new rule rollout;
* poor rule calibration.

Interpretation requires context.

---

## Rule Suppression Rate

A growing suppression rate may indicate that a rule requires review.

Conceptually:

```text
Suppressions ↑
      ↓
Investigate
      ↓
Code Problem?
Rule Problem?
Migration Problem?
```

---

## Rule Effectiveness

A rule may be evaluated by whether it detects meaningful problems with acceptable noise.

Possible signals include:

```text
Findings
Confirmed Defects
False Positives
Escaped Defects
Suppression Rate
```

---

## Evidence Observability

Quality Evidence should itself be observable.

Useful information includes:

```text
Evidence Generated
Evidence Missing
Evidence Invalid
Evidence Stale
Evidence Generation Errors
```

Evidence health directly affects assessment confidence.

---

## Evidence Completeness

An indicator may measure:

```text
Evidence Completeness
=
Available Required Evidence
/
Required Evidence
```

The exact metric should preserve critical missing evidence rather than relying only on percentages.

---

## Evidence Freshness

Observability should identify stale evidence.

Example:

```text
Latest Security Evidence:
Revision A

Current Target:
Revision B

State:
STALE
```

---

## Evidence Generation Reliability

Repeated failures to generate a particular evidence type may indicate quality infrastructure debt.

---

## Observability Data Quality

Quality observability depends on reliable telemetry.

Telemetry itself must therefore satisfy quality expectations.

Potential problems include:

* missing events;
* duplicated events;
* incorrect timestamps;
* stale state;
* broken correlations.

---

## Telemetry Completeness

The observability system should know when expected telemetry is missing.

Missing telemetry must not automatically imply healthy quality.

---

## Telemetry Freshness

Dashboards should indicate when data is stale.

Example:

```text
Quality State:
PASS

Last Updated:
14 days ago

Current Revision:
Different

Status:
STALE
```

This prevents false confidence.

---

## Telemetry Integrity

Important quality telemetry should be protected from unauthorized modification.

This is especially important for:

* gate results;
* risk state;
* assessment state;
* exception state.

---

## Telemetry Retention

Retention policy should distinguish between:

```text
Long-Term Quality History
Operational Metrics
Diagnostic Logs
Raw Tool Output
```

Not all telemetry requires identical retention.

---

## Historical Quality Store

A future Quality Platform may maintain a historical store containing:

```text
Assessments
Findings
Risks
Debt
Metrics
Gate Decisions
Quality Events
```

This enables long-term analysis.

---

## Quality Snapshot

A Quality Snapshot captures the quality state at a defined point.

Example:

```text
Snapshot:
Release v5.0.0

Revision:
abc123

Assessment:
PASS

Critical Risks:
0

High Risks:
0

Quality Debt:
12
```

Snapshots support release reconstruction.

---

## Snapshot Immutability

Published release quality snapshots should remain immutable where practical.

Later information should create new records rather than rewrite historical state.

---

## Quality Baseline

A baseline defines a reference quality state.

It may support:

* debt reduction;
* regression detection;
* migration;
* trend comparison.

Baselines should be versioned and traceable.

---

## Quality Regression Detection

A regression detector may compare:

```text
Current Quality State
      vs
Previous Accepted State
```

Potential regression signals include:

```text
New Blocking Finding
New High Risk
New Debt
Domain State Degradation
Metric Threshold Regression
```

---

## Regression Severity

Not every regression is equally significant.

Regression severity should reflect:

* affected domain;
* risk;
* target criticality;
* magnitude;
* persistence.

---

## Quality Health

The framework may provide a high-level Quality Health classification.

For example:

```text
HEALTHY
DEGRADED
AT_RISK
CRITICAL
UNKNOWN
```

This may be useful for dashboards.

However, detailed domain state must remain available.

---

## Quality Health Calculation

A high-level state should not be based on blind averaging.

Conceptually:

```text
Critical Domain Failure
      ↓
Cannot be hidden by healthy low-risk domains
```

Quality Health must preserve blocking semantics.

---

## Unknown Quality State

Unknown must remain a first-class state.

Unknown may occur because:

* evidence is missing;
* automation failed;
* telemetry is stale;
* assessment is incomplete.

Unknown should never be displayed as healthy.

---

## Quality Confidence

Observability may eventually represent confidence in reported quality state.

Confidence may depend on:

```text
Evidence Completeness
Evidence Freshness
Automation Reliability
Assessment Completeness
Telemetry Reliability
```

Confidence should remain separate from quality itself.

---

## Observability and Risk

Quality Observability should make risk evolution visible.

Conceptually:

```text
Signals
      ↓
Risk Detection
      ↓
Risk Trend
      ↓
Engineering Action
```

This enables earlier intervention.

---

## Observability and Quality Debt

Debt should be visible as both inventory and trajectory.

Important questions include:

```text
Is debt increasing?

Where?

Which debt has the highest risk?

Which debt has the highest interest?

Which debt is blocking future work?
```

---

## Observability and Automation

Automation generates much of the telemetry consumed by Quality Observability.

The relationship is:

```text
Quality Automation
      ↓
Telemetry
      ↓
Quality Observability
```

Automation health must also be observed.

---

## Observability and Assessments

Assessments provide normalized quality state.

Observability provides:

* history;
* trends;
* comparisons;
* drill-down;
* alerts.

---

## Observability and Quality Gates

Gate decisions are important observability signals.

Repeated gate failures may reveal systemic quality problems or workflow friction.

---

## Observability and Governance

Governance consumes observability to determine whether quality policy remains effective.

Observability provides evidence for:

* policy changes;
* rule calibration;
* resource allocation;
* framework improvement.

---

## Observability and Continuous Improvement

The continuous improvement loop is:

```text
Quality Activity
      ↓
Quality Signals
      ↓
Observability
      ↓
Insight
      ↓
Engineering Action
      ↓
Quality Improvement
      ↓
New Signals
```

Without observability, improvement becomes guesswork.

---

## Quality Reviews

Periodic Quality Reviews should use observability data.

A review may examine:

```text
Quality Trends
Risk Trends
Debt Trends
Defect Trends
Automation Health
Gate Effectiveness
Escaped Defects
```

The purpose is to identify systemic improvement opportunities.

---

## Quality Review Questions

A mature review should ask:

```text
Where is quality improving?

Where is it degrading?

Which risks are growing?

Which controls produce noise?

Which controls fail to detect real defects?

Where is quality debt accumulating?

Which quality activities consume excessive time?

What should change?
```

---

## Quality Observability Reports

Reports may be generated for:

```text
Component
Plugin
Repository
Release
Quality Domain
Engineering Period
```

Reports should provide both state and trend.

---

## Periodic Quality Report

A periodic report may contain:

```text
Overall Quality State
Quality Trend
Critical Findings
High Risks
Quality Debt
Defect Trend
Automation Health
Gate Results
Escaped Defects
Recommended Actions
```

---

## Executive Quality View

A high-level view may focus on:

```text
Quality Health
Critical Risk
Release Readiness
Debt Trend
Operational Stability
```

This view must remain traceable to engineering detail.

---

## Engineering Quality View

An engineering view may focus on:

```text
Rules
Findings
Tests
Architecture
Automation
Evidence
Defects
```

Different audiences require different presentation without changing underlying truth.

---

## Observability APIs

A future Quality Platform may expose APIs such as:

```text
get_quality_state(target)
get_quality_history(target)
get_findings(filters)
get_risks(filters)
get_debt(filters)
get_quality_metrics(filters)
get_gate_history(target)
```

The exact API belongs to implementation architecture.

---

## Quality Observability CLI

A future CLI may conceptually support:

```text
familyos quality status

familyos quality findings

familyos quality risks

familyos quality debt

familyos quality history
```

Example:

```text
$ familyos quality status

FamilyOS Quality

Overall       PASS_WITH_WARNINGS
Architecture  PASS
Testing       PASS
Security      PASS
Documentation WARNING

High Risks    1
Critical      0
```

---

## Observability Events API

Consumers may subscribe to significant quality events.

Example:

```text
quality.gate.failed
quality.risk.critical
quality.regression.detected
```

This may support integrations with notifications or workflow systems.

---

## Notification Integration

Quality alerts may integrate with FamilyOS notification capabilities in the future.

Notifications should preserve:

* severity;
* target;
* reason;
* actionable context.

---

## Observability Security

Quality telemetry may contain sensitive information.

Examples include:

* security findings;
* repository paths;
* vulnerability details;
* operational failures.

Access should be proportional to sensitivity.

---

## Sensitive Finding Visibility

Critical security findings may require restricted detail while still exposing high-level risk to authorized governance views.

Observability must balance transparency with security.

---

## Observability Privacy

Quality telemetry should avoid collecting unnecessary personal information.

The system should observe engineering artifacts and processes rather than individuals wherever possible.

---

## No Developer Surveillance

Quality Observability must not become employee surveillance.

Metrics should evaluate:

```text
Systems
Processes
Artifacts
Quality Controls
```

not rank individual engineers by simplistic productivity or defect counts.

---

## Responsible Metrics

Metrics should not be used in ways that create incentives to manipulate quality data.

For example:

```text
Goal:
Reduce finding count at all costs
```

may encourage suppression rather than improvement.

The desired goal is:

```text
Reduce meaningful quality risk.
```

---

## Goodhart's Law

When a metric becomes a target, it may stop being a useful metric.

Quality governance should therefore avoid over-optimizing individual numbers.

Multiple signals and engineering judgment remain necessary.

---

## Observability Noise

Too much telemetry can reduce understanding.

The observability system should prioritize:

```text
Relevant
Structured
Actionable
Contextual
Signals
```

rather than collecting every possible event indefinitely.

---

## Signal-to-Noise Ratio

Quality Observability should seek a high signal-to-noise ratio.

A system generating thousands of irrelevant warnings may be less observable than one producing a small number of meaningful signals.

---

## Cardinality Control

Telemetry dimensions should be designed carefully to avoid unbounded cardinality.

Detailed high-cardinality information may belong in logs or evidence records rather than metrics.

---

## Dashboard Overload

Dashboards should not display every available metric.

Each view should answer specific engineering questions.

---

## Alert Overload

Alerts should represent conditions requiring attention.

Informational events belong in dashboards, reports, or history.

---

## Observability Failure

The observability system itself may fail.

Examples include:

```text
Missing Telemetry
Delayed Events
Stale Dashboard
Incorrect Aggregation
Storage Failure
```

These failures should be observable.

---

## Observability Health

The framework may expose:

```text
Telemetry Health
Event Processing Health
Metric Freshness
State Store Health
Dashboard Freshness
```

A degraded observability system should reduce confidence in quality status.

---

## Fail-Safe Observability

When critical observability data is unavailable:

```text
Quality State Confidence
      ↓
Reduced
```

The system should not present stale information as current certainty.

---

## Observability Testing

Quality Observability components should themselves be tested.

Potential tests include:

* event ingestion;
* metric aggregation;
* state calculation;
* alert rules;
* dashboard queries;
* retention behavior.

---

## Observability Validation

The system should periodically validate that expected signals are actually produced.

Example:

```text
Gate Failed
      ↓
Expected Event Missing
      ↓
Observability Defect
```

---

## Observability Quality Debt

Known weaknesses in observability should be tracked as Quality Debt.

Examples include:

* missing architecture metrics;
* incomplete release history;
* manual risk dashboards;
* unreliable event correlation.

---

## Observability Automation

Most telemetry collection should be automated.

Manual observability data entry should be limited to information that genuinely requires human judgment, such as some risk assessments.

---

## Observability Versioning

Telemetry schemas, metric definitions, and event contracts should be versioned where compatibility matters.

Historical data must remain interpretable.

---

## Metric Definition Changes

Changing the definition of a metric may invalidate historical comparisons.

For example:

```text
Coverage v1
      ≠
Coverage v2
```

when the underlying calculation changes.

Such changes should be documented.

---

## Event Schema Changes

Quality event schemas should evolve compatibly where practical.

Consumers should not break unexpectedly because of uncontrolled telemetry changes.

---

## Dashboard Versioning

Important release or governance dashboards may require version-aware interpretation when underlying metrics evolve.

---

## Observability Scalability

Quality Observability must scale as FamilyOS grows across:

```text
More Repositories
More Plugins
More Rules
More Tests
More Releases
More Evidence
More Events
```

Aggregation and retention strategies should anticipate growth.

---

## Aggregation Levels

Telemetry may be aggregated at different levels:

```text
Rule
Component
Plugin
Domain
Repository
Release
Platform
```

Aggregation must preserve access to important detail.

---

## Pre-Aggregation

Frequently queried historical metrics may eventually be pre-aggregated for efficiency.

Raw authoritative evidence should remain available according to retention policy.

---

## Quality Data Model

A future unified quality data model may connect:

```text
Target
Revision
Profile
Rule
Check
Evidence
Finding
Defect
Risk
Debt
Assessment
Gate
Event
Metric
```

This relationship model is the foundation of advanced Quality Observability.

---

## Quality Graph

The quality data model may eventually form a graph.

Example:

```text
Plugin
  ↓
Assessment
  ↓
Finding
  ↓
Rule
  ↓
Evidence

Finding
  ↓
Risk
  ↓
Mitigation

Finding
  ↓
Defect
  ↓
Regression Test
```

Graph relationships enable powerful investigation.

---

## Quality Intelligence

At high maturity, observability may evolve toward Quality Intelligence.

Quality Intelligence combines:

```text
Historical Quality Data
Current Quality State
Risk
Trends
Relationships
Engineering Context
```

to provide deeper insights.

---

## AI-Assisted Observability

AI may assist with:

* quality report summarization;
* anomaly explanation;
* finding clustering;
* trend interpretation;
* correlation discovery;
* root cause suggestions.

AI output should remain traceable to underlying quality data.

---

## AI Guardrails

AI must not invent quality signals.

Any AI-generated conclusion should distinguish between:

```text
Observed Evidence
Derived Analysis
Hypothesis
```

Authoritative quality state remains determined by governed quality mechanisms.

---

## Predictive Quality Intelligence

Future predictive capabilities may estimate:

```text
Regression Risk
Debt Growth
Automation Instability
Likely Defect Areas
Release Risk
```

These predictions should initially remain advisory.

---

## Observability Maturity Model

Quality Observability may mature through:

```text
Level 1
Isolated Tool Output

    ↓

Level 2
Centralized Quality Reports

    ↓

Level 3
Structured Quality Metrics

    ↓

Level 4
Quality Dashboards

    ↓

Level 5
Historical Trends and Alerts

    ↓

Level 6
Cross-Domain Correlation

    ↓

Level 7
Quality Intelligence
```

---

## Initial Implementation

An initial FamilyOS Quality Observability implementation may begin with:

```text
Quality Check Results
      ↓
Structured Evidence
      ↓
Assessment Results
      ↓
Simple Quality Report
```

Initial observable information may include:

```text
Check Status
Finding Count
Severity
Test Results
Assessment State
Gate State
Execution Duration
```

This provides immediate value without requiring a complex observability platform.

---

## Initial Quality Status

A first implementation may conceptually expose:

```text
FamilyOS Quality Status

Lint             PASS
Type Check       PASS
Tests            PASS
Architecture     PASS
Documentation    PASS

Findings
Critical         0
High             0
Medium           2

Assessment       PASS_WITH_WARNINGS
```

---

## Initial History

A simple history may retain:

```text
Revision
Timestamp
Assessment
Findings
Gate Result
```

This is sufficient to begin trend analysis.

---

## Initial Alerts

Initial alerting should remain limited.

Good initial candidates include:

```text
Critical Finding
Critical Risk
Release Gate Failure
Required Quality Automation Failure
```

Additional alerts should be introduced only when operational value is demonstrated.

---

## Evolution Strategy

Quality Observability should evolve incrementally:

```text
Structured Results
      ↓
Metrics
      ↓
Historical State
      ↓
Dashboards
      ↓
Alerts
      ↓
Correlation
      ↓
Quality Intelligence
```

The platform should not build complex observability infrastructure before sufficient quality data exists.

---

## Relationship With Quality Metrics

Quality Metrics define what is measured.

Quality Observability defines how those measurements become visible, contextual, historical, and actionable.

---

## Relationship With Quality Evidence

Quality Evidence provides authoritative facts.

Observability provides views over those facts.

```text
Evidence
      ↓
Observability
```

Observability must not modify evidence semantics.

---

## Relationship With Quality Risk

Observability exposes risk state and risk evolution.

Risk signals may also trigger alerts and governance review.

---

## Relationship With Defect and Quality Debt Management

Defects and Quality Debt provide long-lived quality state.

Observability exposes:

* inventory;
* age;
* trend;
* concentration;
* remediation progress.

---

## Relationship With Quality Reviews and Assessments

Assessments produce normalized Quality State.

Observability provides history and comparative understanding of that state.

---

## Relationship With Quality Automation

Automation is a primary telemetry producer.

Observability measures both the results of automation and the health of the automation system itself.

---

## Relationship With Quality Gates

Quality Gates produce authoritative progression decisions.

Observability makes those decisions visible and analyzable over time.

---

## Relationship With Quality Governance

Governance uses observability to evaluate:

* quality policy effectiveness;
* risk;
* debt;
* exceptions;
* framework health.

Observability therefore provides a primary evidence source for Quality Governance.

---

## Relationship With Operational Observability

Quality Observability and runtime observability are distinct but connected.

```text
Engineering Quality Observability
      ↓
Release
      ↓
Runtime Observability
      ↓
Operational Outcomes
      ↓
Quality Feedback
```

Operational failures should feed engineering quality analysis.

---

## Reference Observability Flow

The complete Quality Observability flow can be represented as:

```text
Engineering Activity
      ↓
Quality Automation / Review
      ↓
Quality Evidence
      ↓
Findings + Metrics + Events
      ↓
Quality Telemetry
      ↓
Aggregation
      ↓
Current Quality State
      ↓
Historical Quality State
      ↓
┌───────────────────────────────────┐
│ Dashboards                        │
│ Reports                           │
│ Queries                           │
│ Alerts                            │
│ Trends                            │
│ Correlations                      │
└───────────────────────────────────┘
      ↓
Engineering Insight
      ↓
Risk / Debt / Defect / Policy Action
      ↓
Continuous Improvement
```

---

## Strategic Outcome

Quality Observability enables FamilyOS to move from:

```text
The CI pipeline is green,
so quality is probably fine.
```

toward:

```text
The current FamilyOS quality state is observable.

All required quality evidence is fresh.

No Critical findings or risks exist.

Architecture debt is decreasing.

Test stability is improving.

One documentation domain is degrading.

Automation health is stable.

The current release remains within accepted quality policy.
```

This provides substantially stronger engineering confidence.

---

## Final Observability Principle

Quality cannot be sustainably governed when its state is invisible.

FamilyOS therefore requires quality information to evolve from isolated tool outputs into structured, contextual, historical, and actionable engineering knowledge.

The Quality Observability model establishes the relationship:

```text
Quality Activity
      ↓
Quality Signal
      ↓
Telemetry
      ↓
State
      ↓
Trend
      ↓
Insight
      ↓
Action
```

Through structured telemetry, state reconstruction, metrics, events, dashboards, historical analysis, risk visibility, debt visibility, automation health, alerts, traceability, and continuous feedback, Quality Observability provides FamilyOS with the visibility required to understand not only whether individual checks pass, but whether the complete engineering ecosystem is becoming more reliable, maintainable, secure, and sustainable over time.
