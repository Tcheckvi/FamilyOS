# Quality Framework

## 08 Quality Metrics

### Overview

The FamilyOS Quality Metrics model defines how measurable engineering signals are collected, interpreted, normalized, compared, and used to support quality decisions.

Metrics provide quantitative visibility into selected quality characteristics.

They do not replace engineering judgment.

They complement it.

The purpose of quality metrics is to help FamilyOS understand:

* current quality state;
* historical evolution;
* emerging degradation;
* improvement trends;
* risk concentration;
* quality debt;
* operational effectiveness;
* gate readiness;
* framework effectiveness.

The Quality Metrics model ensures that measurements remain meaningful, contextual, traceable, and aligned with engineering outcomes.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of Quality Metrics is not to maximize numbers.

It is to support better engineering decisions.

A metric is useful when it helps answer a meaningful question.

Examples include:

```text id="yb6cqx"
Is test stability improving?

Is technical debt growing?

Are architecture violations increasing?

Are releases becoming less reliable?

Is documentation completeness improving?

Are security findings decreasing?

Is CI feedback becoming slower?
```

Metrics must therefore remain connected to decisions, risks, and engineering behavior.

---

## Metrics Principle

The foundational principle is:

> A metric is an indicator of quality, not quality itself.

For example:

```text id="0n9d8x"
Test Coverage = 95%
```

does not imply:

```text id="m0rt7e"
Software Quality = 95%
```

Similarly:

```text id="9ldrxu"
Zero Static Analysis Findings
```

does not prove:

```text id="159fcg"
Perfect Maintainability
```

Metrics must always be interpreted within context.

---

## Metric Definition

A Quality Metric is a structured quantitative observation about an engineering target.

Conceptually:

```text id="0yqlkq"
Quality Metric
      =
Definition
      +
Measurement
      +
Scope
      +
Time
      +
Context
```

A metric should have stable semantics so values remain comparable over time.

---

## Metric Identity

Every authoritative metric should have a stable identifier.

A conceptual format may be:

```text id="e4rx5s"
QLT-METRIC-<DOMAIN>-<NUMBER>
```

Examples:

```text id="v66jua"
QLT-METRIC-TST-001
QLT-METRIC-SEC-002
QLT-METRIC-ARC-004
QLT-METRIC-DOC-003
```

Stable identifiers support:

* reporting;
* trend analysis;
* dashboards;
* governance;
* automation;
* historical comparison.

---

## Metric Metadata

A metric definition may include:

```text id="w9y9kt"
id
name
description
domain
unit
scope
aggregation
source
owner
version
status
target
warning_threshold
failure_threshold
```

Metric definitions should be versioned when their semantics change materially.

---

## Metric Name

Metric names should describe what is being measured.

Good examples:

```text id="b3wmyn"
Unit Test Pass Rate
Open Critical Security Findings
Architecture Violation Count
Documentation Completeness Ratio
```

Avoid tool-specific names where a broader quality concept exists.

---

## Metric Description

A metric description must explain:

* what is measured;
* why it matters;
* how it is calculated;
* what its limitations are.

This prevents misleading interpretation.

---

## Metric Domain

Every metric must belong to one primary Quality Domain.

Examples:

```text id="2nd3gu"
Testing
Security
Architecture
Maintainability
Documentation
Build
Developer Experience
```

Metrics may influence multiple domains, but a primary classification improves ownership and reporting.

---

## Metric Unit

Metrics must define their measurement unit.

Possible units include:

```text id="m2i06g"
count
percent
ratio
seconds
milliseconds
bytes
events_per_hour
failures_per_run
```

Units must remain consistent across historical comparisons.

---

## Metric Scope

Metrics may operate at different scopes.

Examples include:

```text id="k9cbe7"
File
Module
Package
Plugin
Repository
Build
Release
Platform
```

A metric value without scope is often meaningless.

For example:

```text id="mk8ygk"
Coverage = 80%
```

must specify what was measured.

---

## Metric Timestamp

Metrics are observations in time.

Each value should record:

```text id="cl3k8u"
measurement_time
target_state
source_revision
```

where practical.

This enables reliable trend analysis.

---

## Metric Source

Every metric should identify its source.

Possible sources include:

* testing systems;
* static analysis;
* quality engines;
* security scanners;
* build systems;
* documentation validators;
* runtime observability;
* governance systems.

The source must be traceable to the measurement.

---

## Metric Evidence

Metric values are a form of Quality Evidence.

A metric should therefore be associated with:

```text id="zk7t62"
Check
    ↓
Measurement
    ↓
Evidence
    ↓
Metric Value
```

This allows the system to reconstruct how the value was produced.

---

## Metric Categories

Quality metrics may be grouped into several categories.

Initial categories include:

```text id="8n9txr"
Outcome Metrics
Process Metrics
Risk Metrics
Trend Metrics
Efficiency Metrics
Reliability Metrics
Debt Metrics
Governance Metrics
```

These categories describe how the measurement is used.

---

## Outcome Metrics

Outcome metrics measure engineering results.

Examples include:

* escaped defect count;
* failed releases;
* critical incidents;
* regression count;
* security vulnerabilities.

Outcome metrics often reflect the final effect of engineering quality practices.

They may be lagging indicators.

---

## Process Metrics

Process metrics measure engineering activity.

Examples include:

* review completion rate;
* quality gate execution rate;
* test execution rate;
* validation coverage;
* remediation time.

Process metrics indicate how consistently quality practices are applied.

---

## Risk Metrics

Risk metrics measure exposure.

Examples include:

```text id="rgznh4"
Open Critical Findings
Unpatched Vulnerabilities
Expired Exceptions
Unsupported Dependencies
Untested Critical Components
```

Risk metrics are particularly important for release and governance decisions.

---

## Trend Metrics

Trend metrics represent changes over time.

Examples include:

```text id="sdojeg"
Coverage Trend
Finding Growth Rate
Build Duration Trend
Defect Trend
Security Risk Trend
```

Trend metrics often provide more insight than isolated values.

---

## Efficiency Metrics

Efficiency metrics evaluate quality system cost.

Examples include:

* CI duration;
* check execution time;
* test suite duration;
* quality feedback latency;
* average remediation time.

These metrics help maintain developer experience and scalability.

---

## Reliability Metrics

Reliability metrics measure stability.

Examples include:

```text id="uotqlv"
Flaky Test Rate
CI Failure Rate
Build Success Rate
Quality Check Error Rate
Release Success Rate
```

A quality system that is itself unreliable reduces engineering confidence.

---

## Debt Metrics

Debt metrics measure unresolved quality deficiencies.

Examples include:

* known architecture violations;
* accepted risk findings;
* missing tests;
* unresolved documentation gaps;
* deprecated dependencies;
* manual quality checks.

Debt metrics should support reduction strategies.

---

## Governance Metrics

Governance metrics measure quality process control.

Examples include:

```text id="07miqv"
Expired Exceptions
Unowned Rules
Unreviewed High Findings
Deprecated Rules Still Active
Unresolved Gate Overrides
```

These metrics expose weaknesses in quality governance.

---

## Leading and Lagging Indicators

Metrics may be leading or lagging indicators.

### Leading Indicators

Leading indicators may predict future quality risk.

Examples:

```text id="t10i24"
Increasing Complexity
Declining Test Coverage
Growing Dependency Age
Increasing Architecture Violations
```

These signals may indicate future problems before failures occur.

### Lagging Indicators

Lagging indicators reflect outcomes already observed.

Examples:

```text id="ev2dn6"
Production Defects
Security Incidents
Failed Releases
Customer-Visible Regressions
```

A mature quality system should use both.

---

## Metric Normalization

Different tools may report similar measurements differently.

The Quality Framework should normalize metrics into stable definitions.

For example:

```text id="z964d0"
Tool A Coverage
Tool B Coverage
      ↓
Normalized Coverage Metric
```

Normalization must preserve semantic accuracy.

---

## Metric Aggregation

Metrics may be aggregated across scopes.

Example:

```text id="5xau7l"
Module Metrics
      ↓
Package Metrics
      ↓
Plugin Metrics
      ↓
Repository Metrics
```

Aggregation rules must be mathematically and semantically valid.

Not every metric should be aggregated through simple averaging.

---

## Weighted Aggregation

Some metrics may require weighted aggregation.

For example, test coverage across modules may need weighting by statement or branch count rather than simple module averages.

The framework must avoid misleading aggregation.

---

## Non-Aggregatable Metrics

Some metrics should not be aggregated.

Examples may include:

* critical finding presence;
* release gate status;
* binary compliance state.

For example:

```text id="5j8d38"
One Critical Security Finding
```

must not disappear inside an average.

---

## Metric Thresholds

Metrics may define thresholds.

A conceptual model may include:

```text id="s01bho"
target
warning_threshold
failure_threshold
```

Example:

```text id="3z41kt"
Test Coverage

target: 90%
warning: < 85%
failure: < 75%
```

Thresholds must be contextual and profile-aware.

---

## Threshold Semantics

Thresholds must define comparison semantics explicitly.

For example:

```text id="z3q4rz"
greater_than
greater_or_equal
less_than
less_or_equal
equal
```

Ambiguous thresholds must not be used for gate decisions.

---

## Threshold Profiles

Different profiles may define different thresholds.

Example:

```text id="dn062n"
Baseline Profile
Coverage Minimum = 75%

Production Profile
Coverage Minimum = 85%

Critical Component Profile
Coverage Minimum = 90%
```

Stricter assurance contexts may require stronger thresholds.

---

## Metric Targets

A target represents a desired value.

Targets may differ from blocking thresholds.

Example:

```text id="f7e3to"
Target Coverage = 95%
Blocking Minimum = 85%
```

This allows continuous improvement without blocking every deviation from the aspirational target.

---

## Metric Direction

Metric definitions should specify whether improvement means increasing or decreasing values.

Examples:

```text id="ik02j2"
Coverage
Higher is generally better

Critical Finding Count
Lower is better

Build Duration
Lower is generally better
```

This is necessary for trend interpretation.

---

## Metric Baselines

Metrics should support baselines.

A baseline represents a reference state.

For example:

```text id="g1sgd9"
Baseline Build Duration
      40 seconds

Current Build Duration
      55 seconds

Regression
      +37.5%
```

Baselines enable meaningful comparison.

---

## Baseline Types

Possible baseline types include:

```text id="zyr5xb"
Previous Commit
Main Branch
Previous Release
Historical Average
Approved Reference
```

The baseline must be explicit.

---

## Trend Analysis

Historical metric values create trends.

Conceptually:

```text id="hkrkr4"
Metric Values
      ↓
Time Series
      ↓
Trend Analysis
      ↓
Engineering Insight
```

Trends may reveal:

* steady improvement;
* slow degradation;
* sudden regression;
* instability;
* seasonal variation.

---

## Trend Window

Trend calculations should define a window.

Examples include:

```text id="fdvl9t"
Last 10 Builds
Last 30 Days
Last 5 Releases
```

The selected window affects interpretation.

It must therefore remain explicit.

---

## Trend Direction

A trend may be classified as:

```text id="5vibdo"
IMPROVING
STABLE
DEGRADING
VOLATILE
UNKNOWN
```

Trend classification should not hide raw data.

---

## Metric Volatility

Some metrics fluctuate naturally.

For example:

* performance;
* execution duration;
* flaky tests;
* runtime errors.

The framework should distinguish normal variation from meaningful degradation.

---

## Statistical Interpretation

Where useful, metrics may use statistical techniques.

Examples include:

* moving averages;
* percentiles;
* standard deviation;
* confidence intervals.

Statistical complexity should only be introduced where it improves engineering decisions.

---

## Avoiding False Precision

Metrics must not imply greater precision than the underlying data supports.

For example:

```text id="j9gqya"
Quality Score = 87.234%
```

may be meaningless if the score is based on subjective weighting.

The framework should prefer understandable values.

---

## Composite Metrics

Composite metrics combine several measurements.

They may be useful in limited contexts.

However, composite metrics create risks:

* hidden weighting;
* misleading simplification;
* loss of domain visibility.

A composite metric must never hide critical underlying failures.

---

## Quality Scores

The framework may eventually support quality scores, but they must be used cautiously.

A score should not replace:

```text id="wwsg18"
Findings
Domain Status
Gate Status
Risk
Evidence
```

A numeric score may summarize.

It must not become authoritative by itself.

---

## No Universal Quality Percentage

FamilyOS should not define a universal single percentage representing total quality.

Quality is multidimensional.

For example:

```text id="r68df7"
Correctness      PASS
Security         FAIL
Documentation    PASS
Testing          PASS
```

cannot responsibly become:

```text id="fapofk"
Overall Quality = 75%
```

because the security failure may be blocking.

---

## Testing Metrics

Testing metrics may include:

```text id="hrrd8f"
Test Pass Rate
Statement Coverage
Branch Coverage
Mutation Score
Flaky Test Rate
Test Execution Duration
Test Failure Frequency
```

These metrics should be interpreted alongside test relevance and risk.

---

## Test Coverage

Coverage measures execution, not correctness.

Coverage should therefore answer:

```text id="t5v3wm"
Which implementation areas are exercised by tests?
```

It does not answer:

```text id="rffipl"
Are all behaviors correctly tested?
```

Coverage is valuable when interpreted appropriately.

---

## Flaky Test Rate

Flaky tests reduce trust in verification.

A possible metric is:

```text id="bkzuel"
Flaky Test Rate
=
Flaky Test Executions
/
Total Test Executions
```

High flakiness should be treated as a testing quality problem.

---

## Architecture Metrics

Architecture metrics may include:

* forbidden dependency count;
* architecture violation count;
* dependency cycle count;
* boundary violation count;
* coupling indicators.

These metrics can reveal architecture drift.

---

## Architecture Violation Trend

A useful signal may be:

```text id="chvn7q"
Architecture Violations

Release 1 → 2
Release 2 → 3
Release 3 → 8
Release 4 → 14
```

This indicates systemic degradation even before architectural failure becomes critical.

---

## Maintainability Metrics

Maintainability metrics may include:

```text id="vh7zaf"
Cyclomatic Complexity
Duplication Ratio
Module Size
Dependency Coupling
Code Churn
Technical Debt Count
```

These measurements must be interpreted contextually.

---

## Complexity Metrics

Complexity measurements can identify risky code.

They must not become automatic judgments of design quality.

A complex algorithm may legitimately require higher complexity than simple orchestration code.

Thresholds should therefore remain contextual.

---

## Security Metrics

Security metrics may include:

```text id="gbnbuu"
Open Critical Vulnerabilities
Open High Findings
Mean Remediation Time
Dependency Vulnerability Count
Secrets Detection Findings
```

Critical security metrics may directly affect release gates.

---

## Vulnerability Age

A useful security metric may be:

```text id="8hd7wv"
Vulnerability Age
=
Current Date
-
Finding Creation Date
```

Long-lived unresolved vulnerabilities may indicate governance problems.

---

## Reliability Metrics

Reliability metrics may include:

```text id="0q7aau"
Failure Rate
Recovery Success Rate
Incident Count
Mean Time Between Failures
Mean Time To Recovery
Retry Failure Rate
```

Runtime metrics become especially important once FamilyOS operates deployed services.

---

## Performance Metrics

Performance metrics may include:

```text id="b2xqvi"
Latency
Throughput
Memory Usage
CPU Usage
Startup Time
CLI Execution Time
Build Duration
Test Duration
```

Performance should be compared against meaningful baselines.

---

## Percentile Metrics

For runtime latency, percentiles may provide more insight than averages.

Examples:

```text id="f1l456"
p50
p90
p95
p99
```

Percentiles should only be used when sufficient data exists.

---

## Documentation Metrics

Documentation metrics may include:

```text id="eoyrsq"
Required Document Completeness
Broken Link Count
Missing Metadata Count
Outdated Document Count
Review Currency
Traceability Coverage
```

Documentation quality should not be reduced to word count.

---

## Compatibility Metrics

Compatibility metrics may include:

* breaking change count;
* deprecated interface count;
* migration failure count;
* contract test failures.

These metrics support controlled evolution.

---

## Dependency Metrics

Dependency metrics may include:

```text id="ixihm2"
Outdated Dependency Count
Unsupported Dependency Count
Known Vulnerability Count
Direct Dependency Count
Transitive Dependency Count
Dependency Cycle Count
```

Dependency count alone should not be interpreted as bad quality.

Context matters.

---

## Build Metrics

Build metrics may include:

```text id="qy8dsy"
Build Success Rate
Build Duration
Reproducibility Rate
Artifact Validation Failure Count
Dependency Resolution Failure Count
```

These metrics contribute to engineering reliability.

---

## Release Metrics

Release metrics may include:

```text id="aol2lc"
Release Gate Pass Rate
Failed Release Count
Rollback Count
Post-Release Defect Count
Release Lead Time
```

Release metrics should help identify systemic delivery risk.

---

## Developer Experience Metrics

Developer Experience metrics may include:

```text id="61kzdx"
Local Check Duration
CI Feedback Time
Mean Time to Resolve Quality Failure
Quality Check False Positive Rate
Environment Setup Time
```

Quality enforcement that significantly damages developer productivity must itself be improved.

---

## Quality System Metrics

The Quality Framework should observe itself.

Metrics may include:

```text id="xcj9tf"
Check Error Rate
Rule Execution Duration
Gate Evaluation Duration
Evidence Processing Time
False Positive Rate
Exception Frequency
Suppression Frequency
```

This allows the framework to continuously improve.

---

## Finding Metrics

Quality findings generate valuable metrics.

Examples include:

```text id="l37x7m"
Open Finding Count
New Finding Count
Resolved Finding Count
Critical Finding Count
Finding Age
Remediation Time
```

Finding metrics help evaluate both risk and engineering effectiveness.

---

## Finding Density

Finding density may normalize counts against scope.

Example:

```text id="bb1qev"
Findings per 1,000 Lines
```

Such metrics should be used cautiously because different components have different risk and complexity.

---

## Finding Age

Finding age measures unresolved duration.

Conceptually:

```text id="l8hmzx"
Finding Age
=
Current Time
-
Finding Creation Time
```

A high number of old findings may indicate uncontrolled debt.

---

## Mean Time to Remediation

Mean Time to Remediation may measure how quickly quality issues are resolved.

It can be calculated by:

```text id="rbq44w"
MTTR
=
Sum of Remediation Durations
/
Resolved Finding Count
```

Different severity levels should often be analyzed separately.

---

## Quality Debt Metrics

Quality debt may be measured across categories.

Examples include:

```text id="0ryz2h"
Baselined Findings
Approved Exceptions
Missing Automated Checks
Known Flaky Tests
Architecture Debt
Documentation Debt
```

Debt metrics should encourage reduction rather than normalize permanent deficiency.

---

## Exception Metrics

Exception metrics may include:

```text id="nsl6q8"
Active Exception Count
Expired Exception Count
Average Exception Age
Repeated Exception Count
Exception Renewal Rate
```

Frequent exceptions may indicate unsuitable rules or weak governance.

---

## Suppression Metrics

Suppression frequency may reveal problematic quality rules.

Example:

```text id="a7ocsl"
Rule X
    ↓
500 suppressions
```

This may indicate:

* false positives;
* poor scope;
* unsuitable severity;
* incomplete migration.

Suppression volume should therefore be observable.

---

## Gate Metrics

Quality Gate metrics may include:

```text id="fqdkpb"
Gate Pass Rate
Gate Failure Rate
Conditional Pass Rate
Most Common Blocking Domain
Average Resolution Time
```

These metrics help assess gate effectiveness.

---

## Quality Profile Metrics

Profiles may be measured through:

```text id="9j84d7"
Targets Using Profile
Average Rule Count
Failure Rate
Execution Duration
Exception Count
```

This helps determine whether profiles are appropriately designed.

---

## Metric Collection

Metric collection should be automated where practical.

The collection pipeline may follow:

```text id="vg1dbu"
Quality Check
      ↓
Evidence
      ↓
Metric Extraction
      ↓
Metric Store
      ↓
Trend Analysis
```

Manual metrics should only be used where automation is impractical.

---

## Metric Store

The architecture may introduce a Quality Metric Store.

The store may preserve:

* metric definition;
* metric value;
* timestamp;
* target;
* source revision;
* profile;
* evidence reference.

Historical data enables long-term analysis.

---

## Metric Immutability

Published metric observations should not be silently modified.

Corrections should produce traceable updates.

The framework must preserve historical integrity.

---

## Metric Retention

Metric retention should reflect analytical value and storage cost.

Some metrics may require long-term retention for:

* release comparison;
* architecture trends;
* security risk;
* quality governance.

Retention policy must be explicit.

---

## Metric Cardinality

Metrics with excessive dimensions can create scalability problems.

For example, recording a separate metric for every source line may be impractical.

The framework should balance analytical depth with operational cost.

---

## Metric Tagging

Metrics may include dimensions such as:

```text id="xiedze"
repository
plugin
domain
branch
profile
release
environment
```

Tags must remain controlled to avoid unbounded cardinality.

---

## Metric Context

Metrics must include enough context to interpret them correctly.

For example:

```text id="4d7b07"
Test Duration = 45 seconds
```

is more meaningful with:

```text id="4sswwn"
Profile = Full
Tests = 1,200
Environment = CI
Revision = abc123
```

---

## Metric Comparison

Metrics may be compared against:

```text id="w1d7q7"
Target
Threshold
Baseline
Previous Measurement
Historical Average
Previous Release
```

The comparison basis must be explicit.

---

## Regression Detection

A metric may trigger a regression when change exceeds an allowed boundary.

Example:

```text id="l6wms5"
Build Duration

Baseline = 30s
Current = 45s
Allowed Regression = 20%

Result = Regression
```

Regression rules should account for normal measurement variance.

---

## Relative vs Absolute Thresholds

Thresholds may be absolute:

```text id="0hlpmp"
Latency < 200ms
```

or relative:

```text id="lrvqpf"
No more than 10% slower than baseline
```

Both models may be useful depending on the metric.

---

## Metric Gate Integration

Metrics may contribute to Quality Gates.

Example:

```text id="0qoevc"
Coverage Metric
      ↓
Testing Requirement
      ↓
Threshold Evaluation
      ↓
Finding
      ↓
Merge Gate
```

Metrics should not bypass the Quality Rule and Assessment architecture.

---

## Metrics and Rules

The relationship between metrics and rules is:

```text id="vg9bwa"
Metric
     ↓
Observed Value

Rule
     ↓
Expected Condition

Evaluation
     ↓
PASS / FAIL / WARNING
```

A metric alone is descriptive.

A rule gives it decision semantics.

---

## Metrics and Findings

A threshold violation may generate a finding.

Example:

```text id="j59i01"
Metric:
Coverage = 72%

Rule:
Minimum = 80%

Finding:
Coverage below required threshold
```

The original metric value remains evidence.

---

## Metrics and Assessments

Assessments may use several metrics simultaneously.

Example:

```text id="1alhub"
Testing Assessment
      ↓
Pass Rate
Coverage
Flakiness
Execution Errors
```

The assessment should preserve individual values rather than collapsing them prematurely.

---

## Metrics and Risk

Metrics can reveal risk concentration.

Example:

```text id="vpuj95"
Critical Findings = 0
High Findings = 12
Finding Age > 90 days = 8
```

This may indicate significant unresolved quality debt.

Risk evaluation should consider both severity and persistence.

---

## Metric Alerting

Some metrics may trigger alerts.

Examples:

```text id="xu89mu"
Critical Finding Count > 0
CI Error Rate > threshold
Coverage Regression > threshold
Build Duration Regression > threshold
```

Alerts should be actionable and avoid unnecessary noise.

---

## Metric Noise

Excessive alerts create metric fatigue.

The framework should minimize:

* redundant alerts;
* low-value thresholds;
* unstable measurements;
* non-actionable notifications.

A metric should not generate enforcement simply because it exists.

---

## Metric Governance

Metric definitions must be governed.

Governance should cover:

* ownership;
* semantics;
* lifecycle;
* thresholds;
* aggregation;
* deprecation;
* reporting.

Changing a metric definition may invalidate historical comparisons.

---

## Metric Ownership

Every authoritative metric should have an owner.

The owner is responsible for:

* definition;
* calculation;
* interpretation;
* threshold guidance;
* lifecycle;
* documentation.

Unowned metrics should not become authoritative gate inputs.

---

## Metric Lifecycle

A metric may follow a lifecycle such as:

```text id="317jiu"
DRAFT
  ↓
EXPERIMENTAL
  ↓
ACTIVE
  ↓
DEPRECATED
  ↓
RETIRED
```

Experimental metrics should not automatically become blocking.

---

## Metric Versioning

Metrics require versioning when:

* calculation changes;
* scope changes;
* unit changes;
* aggregation changes;
* interpretation changes.

Historical values must remain associated with the definition used when they were produced.

---

## Metric Deprecation

A deprecated metric should define:

* reason;
* replacement;
* migration guidance;
* retirement date.

Metric identifiers must not be reused for different meanings.

---

## Metric Validation

Metric collection pipelines should validate values.

Examples include:

* correct type;
* valid unit;
* expected range;
* valid target;
* valid definition reference.

Invalid measurements must not silently enter authoritative quality data.

---

## Missing Metric Data

Missing data must remain distinguishable from zero.

For example:

```text id="1typrf"
Critical Findings = 0
```

is different from:

```text id="on9q6y"
Critical Findings = UNKNOWN
```

Unknown values must not be interpreted as success.

---

## Metric Errors

Collection errors should be visible.

Possible states may include:

```text id="2mxlpf"
AVAILABLE
MISSING
INVALID
ERROR
NOT_APPLICABLE
```

This prevents incorrect quality conclusions.

---

## Metric Reproducibility

Where possible, metric measurements should be reproducible.

Equivalent:

```text id="7o2hgv"
Source State
Configuration
Tool Version
Environment
```

should produce comparable results.

---

## Metric Environment Sensitivity

Some metrics depend strongly on environment.

Examples:

* performance;
* build duration;
* test execution time.

Environment metadata should therefore accompany such measurements.

Cross-environment comparisons must be handled cautiously.

---

## Metric Calibration

Thresholds should be calibrated using actual data.

For example, a performance threshold should ideally consider observed baseline behavior rather than arbitrary values.

Calibration helps reduce false regressions.

---

## Metric Review

Metrics should be periodically reviewed.

Questions include:

```text id="c7llnx"
Does this metric still support decisions?

Is the calculation still valid?

Is the threshold meaningful?

Is the metric being gamed?

Does it create harmful incentives?

Is it redundant?
```

Metrics that no longer provide value should be retired.

---

## Goodhart's Law Awareness

The framework must recognize the risk that metrics become targets.

When a measurement becomes the primary objective, engineering behavior may optimize the number rather than the underlying quality.

Examples include:

```text id="pl1d74"
Writing meaningless tests to increase coverage.

Splitting findings to improve severity distribution.

Suppressing warnings to improve dashboards.
```

Metric design must actively avoid such incentives.

---

## Anti-Gaming Principle

Quality metrics must not reward superficial optimization.

A metric should be combined with:

* contextual review;
* evidence;
* domain interpretation;
* multiple supporting signals.

No critical engineering decision should rely blindly on a single metric.

---

## Metric Transparency

Engineers should be able to understand how a metric is calculated.

Opaque scoring models reduce trust.

The framework should expose:

```text id="dlpm2v"
Definition
Formula
Source
Scope
Threshold
Interpretation
```

where applicable.

---

## Metric Explainability

If a metric contributes to a failed gate, the engineer should be able to understand:

```text id="7d46sr"
Which metric failed?

What was the measured value?

What was the threshold?

Which profile defined the threshold?

Which evidence generated the value?
```

This is essential for actionable feedback.

---

## Metric Dashboards

The Quality Framework may eventually expose quality dashboards.

A dashboard may show:

* domain status;
* trend charts;
* critical findings;
* quality debt;
* release readiness;
* execution performance.

Dashboards should consume structured metric data.

They must not become the authoritative source of quality rules.

---

## Metric Reporting

Quality reports should include metrics when they materially support interpretation.

Example:

```text id="82htpe"
Testing

Pass Rate:
100%

Coverage:
91%

Flaky Tests:
2

Coverage Trend:
Improving
```

Reports should avoid overwhelming engineers with low-value measurements.

---

## Executive Metrics

High-level stakeholders may require aggregated metrics.

Examples include:

```text id="hh2j11"
Critical Risk Count
Quality Gate Success Rate
Release Regression Rate
Quality Debt Trend
```

High-level reporting must preserve access to underlying evidence.

---

## Engineering Metrics

Engineers often require more detailed measurements.

Examples include:

* per-module coverage;
* rule execution time;
* individual finding age;
* dependency risk;
* architecture violations.

Different audiences may require different reporting layers.

---

## Historical Metrics

Historical data enables FamilyOS to understand long-term quality evolution.

Example:

```text id="6xugty"
Release 1
Architecture Violations = 12

Release 2
Architecture Violations = 8

Release 3
Architecture Violations = 3
```

This provides evidence of improvement.

---

## Release Comparison

Release-level metric comparison can reveal meaningful changes.

Example:

```text id="h3aqen"
Release v4.1

Coverage              89%
Critical Findings      0
Build Duration         32s

Release v4.2

Coverage              92%
Critical Findings      0
Build Duration         29s
```

This supports evidence-based release evolution.

---

## Metric Correlation

Advanced analysis may examine correlations.

For example:

```text id="uh5fmf"
Complexity Increase
       ↓
Defect Increase
```

or:

```text id="6ncnk2"
Flaky Tests
       ↓
CI Failure Rate
```

Correlation does not prove causation.

Such analysis should therefore remain advisory.

---

## Predictive Metrics

As sufficient historical data becomes available, metrics may support predictive analysis.

Potential applications include:

* defect risk prediction;
* release risk estimation;
* architecture degradation forecasting;
* test instability prediction.

Predictive models must remain explainable and non-authoritative unless explicitly governed.

---

## AI-Assisted Metric Analysis

AI may assist with:

* trend summarization;
* anomaly explanation;
* metric correlation discovery;
* quality report generation;
* risk hypothesis generation.

AI should not silently redefine metric semantics or thresholds.

The authoritative metric model remains deterministic and governed.

---

## Metric Storage Security

Quality metrics may influence release or compliance decisions.

Metric data therefore requires integrity protection.

Risks include:

* deleted findings;
* modified values;
* falsified trends;
* manipulated thresholds.

Authoritative quality data must remain traceable and protected.

---

## Metric Privacy

Future operational metrics may contain sensitive data.

Quality metrics should therefore follow data minimization principles.

Metrics should capture engineering signals without unnecessarily storing sensitive user data.

---

## Metric Scalability

Large FamilyOS ecosystems may generate significant metric volume.

The architecture should consider:

* retention;
* aggregation;
* sampling;
* indexing;
* storage cost;
* query performance.

Scalability should not compromise metric integrity.

---

## Metric Sampling

Sampling may be appropriate for high-volume operational metrics.

However, sampling must not be used where complete evidence is required.

For example:

```text id="wp84k1"
Security Gate Evidence
```

should not depend on incomplete sampling unless explicitly designed to do so.

---

## Metric Anti-Patterns

The Quality Metrics model rejects several anti-patterns.

### Metric as Quality

A number must not be treated as the complete quality state.

### Vanity Metrics

Measurements that look impressive but do not support decisions should be avoided.

### Hidden Formulas

Opaque scoring reduces trust.

### Arbitrary Thresholds

Thresholds require engineering justification.

### Metric Overload

Excessive measurements create noise.

### Universal Quality Score

Quality cannot responsibly be reduced to one percentage.

### Missing Context

Measurements without scope, environment, or source can be misleading.

### Gaming

Metrics must not encourage superficial optimization.

---

## Initial FamilyOS Quality Metrics

An initial implementation may prioritize a limited high-value metric set.

Examples include:

```text id="tl122j"
Testing
    Test Pass Rate
    Test Coverage
    Test Duration

Architecture
    Architecture Violation Count

Security
    Critical Finding Count
    High Finding Count

Documentation
    Required Artifact Completeness

Build
    Build Success
    Build Duration

Quality System
    Quality Check Error Count
```

Additional metrics should be introduced only when they provide clear value.

---

## Metric Expansion Strategy

Metrics should evolve progressively.

A recommended sequence is:

```text id="j0tynm"
Define
  ↓
Collect
  ↓
Validate
  ↓
Observe
  ↓
Establish Baseline
  ↓
Define Threshold
  ↓
Use in Assessment
  ↓
Use in Gates
```

Not every new metric should immediately become blocking.

---

## Reference Metric Flow

The complete metric lifecycle can be represented as:

```text id="sn6npq"
Quality Activity
      ↓
Measurement
      ↓
Metric Evidence
      ↓
Normalization
      ↓
Metric Store
      ↓
Baseline / Trend Analysis
      ↓
Quality Rule Evaluation
      ↓
Assessment
      ↓
Gate / Report
```

This model preserves the distinction between observation and decision.

---

## Strategic Outcome

The Quality Metrics model enables FamilyOS to move from subjective impressions such as:

```text id="d33jpj"
The codebase seems healthy.
```

toward evidence such as:

```text id="yv17j8"
Architecture violations decreased across three releases.

Critical security findings remain at zero.

Test flakiness decreased from 4% to 1%.

Build duration improved by 18%.

Quality debt decreased by 12 unresolved findings.
```

This provides stronger engineering visibility without pretending that measurements capture every aspect of quality.

---

## Final Metrics Principle

Quality metrics must illuminate engineering reality rather than distort it.

They must help FamilyOS understand:

```text id="n3jmx0"
Where quality stands.

How quality is changing.

Where risk is increasing.

Where improvement is working.

Where intervention is required.
```

Metrics must remain contextual, traceable, explainable, and subordinate to the broader Quality Framework.

The FamilyOS Quality Metrics model therefore establishes the quantitative foundation required for quality evidence, trend analysis, risk management, reporting, observability, governance, and continuous improvement throughout the complete engineering lifecycle.
