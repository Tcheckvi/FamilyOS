# Quality Framework

## 19 Quality Framework Lifecycle

### Overview

The FamilyOS Quality Framework Lifecycle defines how the Quality Framework is created, introduced, adopted, operated, evaluated, evolved, versioned, migrated, deprecated, and eventually retired.

The Quality Framework is not a static collection of rules.

It is a governed engineering capability whose requirements, policies, automation, metrics, evidence models, assessments, gates, and governance mechanisms evolve together with FamilyOS.

The lifecycle can be represented as:

```text
Need
  ↓
Design
  ↓
Review
  ↓
Approval
  ↓
Introduction
  ↓
Adoption
  ↓
Operation
  ↓
Observation
  ↓
Assessment
  ↓
Improvement
  ↓
Evolution
  ↓
Migration
  ↓
Deprecation
  ↓
Retirement
```

The lifecycle ensures that quality mechanisms remain useful, coherent, enforceable, and aligned with the broader FamilyOS engineering ecosystem.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of the Quality Framework Lifecycle is to ensure controlled evolution of FamilyOS quality capabilities.

Without lifecycle governance, a quality framework may accumulate:

```text
Obsolete Rules
Conflicting Requirements
Deprecated Metrics
Unused Automation
Permanent Exceptions
Legacy Profiles
Duplicated Controls
Stale Documentation
```

The desired model is:

```text
Controlled Introduction
      ↓
Measured Adoption
      ↓
Stable Operation
      ↓
Evidence-Based Evaluation
      ↓
Governed Evolution
      ↓
Controlled Migration
      ↓
Explicit Retirement
```

---

## Foundational Principle

The foundational principle is:

> Every authoritative quality mechanism must have a defined lifecycle.

This applies to:

* policies;
* requirements;
* rules;
* profiles;
* metrics;
* gates;
* evidence models;
* automation;
* assessments;
* governance mechanisms.

Nothing should become permanently authoritative merely because it once existed.

---

## Lifecycle Scope

The Quality Framework Lifecycle applies to the complete quality system.

```text
Quality Principles
Quality Policies
Quality Requirements
Quality Rules
Quality Profiles
Quality Metrics
Quality Evidence
Quality Assessments
Quality Risks
Quality Debt
Quality Reviews
Quality Automation
Quality Observability
Quality Gates
Quality Compliance
Continuous Improvement
Quality Governance
```

---

## Framework Lifecycle States

At the highest level, the Quality Framework may move through:

```text
PLANNED
   ↓
ACTIVE
   ↓
EVOLVING
   ↓
DEPRECATED
   ↓
RETIRED
```

These states describe the framework as an engineering capability.

Individual framework elements may have more detailed lifecycles.

---

## PLANNED

`PLANNED` means the framework or capability is being designed but is not yet authoritative.

Activities may include:

* architecture design;
* documentation;
* experimentation;
* proof-of-concept implementation;
* stakeholder review.

---

## ACTIVE

`ACTIVE` means the framework is authoritative and used by FamilyOS engineering.

Its requirements and policies may influence:

```text
Development
Testing
Compliance
Quality Gates
Release Decisions
```

---

## EVOLVING

`EVOLVING` means the framework remains active while significant improvements or migrations are underway.

This is expected to be a common state.

A healthy engineering framework evolves continuously.

---

## DEPRECATED

`DEPRECATED` means the framework or capability remains temporarily supported but should no longer be adopted for new work.

A replacement or migration path should normally exist.

---

## RETIRED

`RETIRED` means the framework or capability is no longer authoritative for current engineering work.

Historical records must remain interpretable.

---

## Framework Introduction

A new quality capability should begin with a demonstrated engineering need.

The introduction path is:

```text
Engineering Problem
      ↓
Quality Need
      ↓
Proposed Capability
      ↓
Design
      ↓
Review
      ↓
Approval
      ↓
Implementation
```

---

## Need Identification

New framework capabilities should address real quality needs.

Potential triggers include:

```text
Repeated Defects
Architecture Drift
Quality Debt
Compliance Requirements
Operational Incidents
Release Failures
Manual Verification Cost
Governance Gaps
```

---

## Capability Proposal

A significant new capability should define:

```text
Problem
Scope
Expected Benefit
Quality Risk Addressed
Architecture
Integration
Migration Impact
Governance
```

---

## Framework Design

Framework design should consider:

* simplicity;
* composability;
* automation;
* evidence;
* observability;
* governance;
* developer experience;
* compatibility.

---

## Framework Review

Significant framework capabilities should be reviewed against:

```text
Engineering Foundation
Architecture Foundation
Testing Framework
Documentation Framework
Build Framework
Release Framework
Plugin Compliance Framework
Security Architecture
```

The objective is ecosystem consistency.

---

## Framework Approval

Approval authority should correspond to the scope of the change.

Local implementation details may require normal engineering review.

Fundamental quality semantics may require Quality Governance or broader architecture approval.

---

## Framework Adoption

Approval does not guarantee adoption.

The adoption lifecycle should be intentional.

```text
Available
   ↓
Documented
   ↓
Integrated
   ↓
Used
   ↓
Enforced
```

---

## Adoption Principle

A framework capability is not successfully adopted merely because it exists.

Successful adoption requires real engineering integration.

---

## Adoption Indicators

Indicators may include:

```text
Repositories Using Capability
Targets Covered
Automation Enabled
Evidence Produced
Developers Receiving Feedback
Gates Consuming Results
```

---

## Adoption Barriers

Potential barriers include:

* excessive complexity;
* poor documentation;
* slow feedback;
* unreliable tooling;
* unclear ownership;
* migration cost.

These should become Continuous Improvement inputs.

---

## Incremental Adoption

Large changes should generally use incremental adoption.

Example:

```text
Pilot
  ↓
Limited Adoption
  ↓
Broader Adoption
  ↓
Default
  ↓
Mandatory
```

---

## Pilot Phase

A pilot validates the capability on limited scope.

The pilot should answer:

```text
Does it detect meaningful problems?

Is the output understandable?

Is execution reliable?

What is the engineering cost?

What false positives exist?
```

---

## Observation Phase

During observation, the capability operates without necessarily blocking progression.

This provides evidence about real-world behavior.

---

## Warning Phase

During warning, violations become visible and remediation is expected.

The system may communicate a future enforcement date.

---

## Enforcement Phase

During enforcement, authoritative policy may affect progression.

```text
Violation
      ↓
Quality Assessment
      ↓
Quality Gate
      ↓
BLOCK
```

when applicable.

---

## Stable Operation

Once adopted, the framework enters stable operation.

Stable does not mean frozen.

It means:

```text
Documented
Owned
Observable
Supported
Predictable
Governed
```

---

## Operational Responsibilities

Active framework capabilities require:

* maintenance;
* support;
* monitoring;
* documentation;
* testing;
* ownership;
* incident handling.

---

## Framework Health

The health of the Quality Framework itself should be observable.

Potential dimensions include:

```text
Automation Reliability
Rule Accuracy
Evidence Completeness
Gate Reliability
Execution Performance
Documentation Freshness
Exception Rate
Developer Friction
```

---

## Framework Health State

A conceptual state model may include:

```text
HEALTHY
DEGRADED
AT_RISK
CRITICAL
UNKNOWN
```

---

## HEALTHY

The framework is functioning within expected quality boundaries.

---

## DEGRADED

Some capabilities are impaired, but core quality assurance remains functional.

---

## AT_RISK

Important quality mechanisms are unreliable or incomplete.

---

## CRITICAL

The framework cannot provide trustworthy quality assurance for critical decisions.

---

## UNKNOWN

Insufficient evidence exists to determine framework health.

---

## Framework Observability

Quality Observability should monitor the framework itself.

Examples include:

```text
Rule Execution Failures
Gate Errors
Evidence Collection Failures
Assessment Failures
Compliance Engine Errors
Metric Pipeline Failures
```

---

## Framework Assessment

Periodic assessment should evaluate whether the Quality Framework remains effective.

Questions include:

```text
Does the framework detect important problems?

Does it prevent regressions?

Does it provide useful feedback?

Is it becoming too complex?

Are controls duplicated?

Are important risks uncovered?

Are engineers bypassing controls?

Are exceptions increasing?
```

---

## Framework Effectiveness

Framework effectiveness should be judged by engineering outcomes.

Useful signals include:

```text
Escaped Defects
Quality Regression Rate
High-Risk Debt
Gate Effectiveness
Compliance Trends
Incident Trends
Feedback Latency
```

---

## Framework Efficiency

Effectiveness alone is insufficient.

The framework should also remain efficient.

Potential measures include:

```text
Validation Duration
CI Cost
Manual Review Effort
False Positive Rate
Developer Waiting Time
```

---

## Framework Sustainability

A framework that requires excessive maintenance may itself become Quality Debt.

Sustainability should consider:

```text
Complexity
Maintenance Cost
Ownership
Tool Dependencies
Operational Burden
```

---

## Framework Evolution

Evolution should respond to evidence.

The evolution loop is:

```text
Operate
   ↓
Observe
   ↓
Measure
   ↓
Assess
   ↓
Identify Improvement
   ↓
Change
   ↓
Validate
   ↓
Operate
```

---

## Evolution Triggers

Triggers may include:

```text
New Architecture
New Plugin Model
New Security Requirement
Repeated Quality Finding
New Tooling
New Release Model
Operational Incident
Quality Debt
Framework Limitation
```

---

## Evolution Categories

Framework evolution may be:

```text
CORRECTIVE
COMPATIBLE
ENHANCING
BREAKING
DEPRECATING
```

---

## Corrective Evolution

Corrective evolution fixes defects in the framework without intentionally changing policy semantics.

Examples:

* incorrect rule logic;
* broken evidence collection;
* incorrect report formatting.

---

## Compatible Evolution

Compatible evolution adds capabilities while preserving existing behavior.

Example:

```text
New Optional Metric
New Report Format
Additional Non-Blocking Rule
```

---

## Enhancing Evolution

Enhancing evolution strengthens quality capability without necessarily breaking existing targets.

Examples:

```text
Better Diagnostics
Faster Validation
Improved Traceability
Additional Automation
```

---

## Breaking Evolution

Breaking evolution changes authoritative semantics in a way that may make previously valid targets invalid.

Examples include:

```text
New Mandatory Requirement
Changed Severity
Stricter Gate
Removed Exception Mechanism
Changed Profile Semantics
```

Breaking evolution requires migration planning.

---

## Deprecating Evolution

Deprecating evolution marks a capability for eventual retirement.

A replacement should normally be identified.

---

## Change Classification

Every significant framework change should be classified.

A conceptual model is:

```text
PATCH
MINOR
MAJOR
```

The exact versioning strategy should align with FamilyOS release governance.

---

## PATCH Change

A PATCH-level change generally preserves semantics.

Examples:

* documentation correction;
* bug fix;
* diagnostic improvement.

---

## MINOR Change

A MINOR-level change may add backward-compatible capability.

Examples:

* optional rule;
* new metric;
* additional report output.

---

## MAJOR Change

A MAJOR-level change may alter normative semantics or require migration.

Examples:

* new mandatory profile;
* changed compliance model;
* incompatible gate behavior.

---

## Framework Versioning

Framework versions should allow historical interpretation.

A quality result should be interpretable against the framework version that produced it.

---

## Version Identity

A formal assessment may conceptually preserve:

```text
framework_version
profile_version
rule_versions
target_revision
```

---

## Historical Reproducibility

Historical quality records should answer:

```text
Which rules applied?

Which profile applied?

Which framework version was authoritative?

Which evidence produced the result?
```

---

## Framework Release

Significant framework versions may be released as governed engineering artifacts.

A framework release may include:

```text
Documentation
Policies
Profiles
Rules
Automation
Migration Guidance
Validation Evidence
Changelog
```

---

## Release Readiness

A framework release should verify:

```text
Documentation Complete
Tests Pass
Rules Validated
Profiles Valid
Migration Documented
Compatibility Assessed
Governance Approval Complete
```

---

## Framework Changelog

Framework changes should be recorded.

A changelog may include:

```text
Added
Changed
Deprecated
Removed
Fixed
Security
Migration
```

---

## Migration

Migration moves engineering targets from an older framework state to a newer one.

```text
Current State
      ↓
Target State
      ↓
Gap Analysis
      ↓
Migration Plan
      ↓
Implementation
      ↓
Validation
      ↓
New State
```

---

## Migration Principle

Breaking quality changes should not be introduced without a credible migration path.

---

## Migration Scope

Migration may affect:

```text
Code
Tests
Documentation
CI
Profiles
Rules
Evidence
Quality Gates
Plugins
Release Process
```

---

## Migration Assessment

Before migration, the impact should be assessed.

Questions include:

```text
How many targets are affected?

Which requirements change?

Which targets become non-compliant?

How much remediation is required?

Can migration be automated?
```

---

## Migration Plan

A migration plan should define:

```text
Source Version
Target Version
Affected Targets
Required Changes
Automation
Validation
Timeline
Ownership
```

---

## Migration Tooling

Where practical, migration should be automated.

Examples include:

```text
Configuration Conversion
Profile Upgrade
Metadata Migration
Documentation Transformation
Rule Remediation
```

---

## Migration Validation

Migration should verify that the target satisfies the new framework requirements.

---

## Parallel Support

During significant migrations, multiple framework versions may temporarily coexist.

Example:

```text
Framework v1
      +
Framework v2
```

Parallel support should remain temporary.

---

## Compatibility Window

A compatibility window defines how long older behavior remains supported.

This should be documented.

---

## Legacy Support

Legacy support should be explicit.

Hidden indefinite compatibility creates maintenance debt.

---

## Legacy Profile

Legacy targets may temporarily use dedicated profiles.

Example:

```text
familyos-legacy-v1
```

Legacy profiles should normally have a retirement strategy.

---

## Deprecation

Deprecation provides controlled notice that a framework capability will be removed.

```text
ACTIVE
   ↓
DEPRECATED
   ↓
RETIRED
```

---

## Deprecation Requirements

A deprecation should identify:

```text
Deprecated Capability
Reason
Replacement
Migration Path
Deprecation Date
Expected Retirement
```

---

## Deprecation Notice

Deprecation should be visible through relevant channels:

* documentation;
* CLI warnings;
* quality reports;
* migration guides;
* release notes.

---

## Deprecation Warning

Automation may produce:

```text
DEPRECATED

Rule QLT-OLD-004 will be retired in framework v3.

Replacement:
QLT-ARCH-012
```

---

## Deprecation Period

The deprecation period should provide reasonable migration time proportional to impact.

---

## Deprecation Metrics

Governance may track:

```text
Targets Using Deprecated Capability
Remaining Migration Work
Time Until Retirement
```

---

## Retirement

Retirement removes a capability from active authoritative use.

Retirement should occur only after:

```text
Replacement Available
Migration Completed or Accepted
Documentation Updated
Automation Updated
Governance Approval
```

where applicable.

---

## Retirement Effects

Retirement may involve:

```text
Rule Removal
Profile Removal
Tool Removal
Policy Retirement
Documentation Archival
Gate Update
```

---

## Historical Preservation

Retirement must not destroy historical interpretability.

Historical records may still reference retired:

```text
Rules
Profiles
Policies
Framework Versions
```

---

## Archival

Retired normative artifacts may be archived.

Archived content should be clearly identified as non-current.

---

## Framework Cleanup

Retirement should include cleanup of:

* obsolete code;
* unused configuration;
* old automation;
* duplicate documentation;
* stale references.

This prevents framework debt.

---

## Rule Lifecycle

Individual Quality Rules should follow a defined lifecycle.

```text
PROPOSED
   ↓
EXPERIMENTAL
   ↓
OBSERVE
   ↓
WARN
   ↓
ENFORCE
   ↓
DEPRECATED
   ↓
RETIRED
```

---

## PROPOSED Rule

The rule exists as a design but is not active.

---

## EXPERIMENTAL Rule

The rule may execute in limited scope for validation.

---

## OBSERVE Rule

The rule collects findings without enforcement.

---

## WARN Rule

The rule produces visible warnings and remediation expectations.

---

## ENFORCE Rule

The rule participates in authoritative quality decisions.

---

## DEPRECATED Rule

The rule remains temporarily supported but should no longer be relied upon.

---

## RETIRED Rule

The rule is removed from active enforcement.

---

## Rule Promotion

Promotion between states should depend on evidence.

Example:

```text
OBSERVE
   ↓
False Positive Rate Acceptable
Rule Stable
Documentation Complete
   ↓
WARN
```

---

## Rule Rollback

A problematic rule may be rolled back.

Example:

```text
ENFORCE
   ↓
Unexpected False Positives
   ↓
WARN
```

Rollback should preserve traceability.

---

## Requirement Lifecycle

Requirements may follow:

```text
PROPOSED
   ↓
APPROVED
   ↓
ACTIVE
   ↓
DEPRECATED
   ↓
RETIRED
```

---

## Requirement Introduction

A requirement should identify:

```text
Authority
Purpose
Applicability
Severity
Verification
Evidence
```

before enforcement.

---

## Requirement Modification

Changing a requirement should trigger impact analysis.

---

## Requirement Deprecation

Deprecated requirements should identify replacement requirements where applicable.

---

## Requirement Retirement

Retired requirements should no longer affect current compliance.

---

## Profile Lifecycle

Quality Profiles may follow:

```text
DRAFT
  ↓
ACTIVE
  ↓
DEPRECATED
  ↓
RETIRED
```

---

## Profile Introduction

A new profile should define:

```text
Target Class
Requirements
Applicability
Severity Policy
Gate Integration
```

---

## Profile Evolution

Profiles should be versioned when requirement membership changes significantly.

---

## Profile Deprecation

Targets should migrate to replacement profiles.

---

## Profile Retirement

Retired profiles should remain available only for historical interpretation where necessary.

---

## Metric Lifecycle

Metrics should also have lifecycles.

```text
PROPOSED
   ↓
EXPERIMENTAL
   ↓
ACTIVE
   ↓
DEPRECATED
   ↓
RETIRED
```

---

## Metric Introduction

A metric should define:

```text
Purpose
Calculation
Source
Interpretation
Owner
```

---

## Metric Validation

Experimental metrics should be validated before influencing governance decisions.

---

## Metric Change

Changes to calculation semantics may require a new metric version.

---

## Metric Retirement

Metrics should be retired when they no longer support meaningful decisions.

---

## Gate Lifecycle

Quality Gates may follow:

```text
PROPOSED
   ↓
OBSERVE
   ↓
WARN
   ↓
ENFORCE
   ↓
DEPRECATED
   ↓
RETIRED
```

---

## Gate Introduction

New gates should be introduced gradually when they may affect significant engineering workflows.

---

## Gate Evaluation

Gate effectiveness should be assessed using:

```text
Block Accuracy
Override Rate
Escaped Problems
Execution Reliability
Feedback Latency
```

---

## Gate Evolution

Gate policy may evolve as quality maturity increases.

---

## Gate Retirement

A gate may be retired when:

* the lifecycle boundary disappears;
* another gate replaces it;
* the risk no longer requires enforcement.

---

## Automation Lifecycle

Quality Automation has its own lifecycle.

```text
DESIGN
   ↓
IMPLEMENT
   ↓
TEST
   ↓
DEPLOY
   ↓
OPERATE
   ↓
MONITOR
   ↓
IMPROVE
   ↓
DEPRECATE
   ↓
RETIRE
```

---

## Automation Introduction

Automation should not become authoritative before sufficient testing.

---

## Automation Testing

Critical quality automation should include:

* unit tests;
* integration tests;
* regression tests;
* failure-path tests.

---

## Automation Deployment

Deployment should preserve compatibility with active policy.

---

## Automation Monitoring

Operational automation should expose:

```text
Execution Status
Latency
Errors
Coverage
Version
```

---

## Automation Upgrade

Automation upgrades should be evaluated for semantic changes.

A tool upgrade that changes findings may effectively change policy behavior.

---

## Automation Deprecation

Deprecated tooling should identify a replacement.

---

## Automation Retirement

Retired tooling should be removed from active quality workflows.

---

## Evidence Lifecycle

Quality Evidence may follow:

```text
CREATED
   ↓
VALID
   ↓
STALE
   ↓
INVALID
   ↓
ARCHIVED
```

---

## Evidence Creation

Evidence should bind to relevant target state.

---

## Evidence Validity

Evidence remains valid while:

```text
Target Relevant State Unchanged
Verification Still Valid
Requirement Still Applicable
Evidence Not Expired
```

---

## Evidence Staleness

Evidence becomes stale when its relevance can no longer be assumed.

---

## Evidence Invalidation

Evidence becomes invalid when known conditions make it unsuitable for authoritative decisions.

---

## Evidence Archival

Historical evidence may be archived according to retention policy.

---

## Assessment Lifecycle

Quality Assessments may follow:

```text
REQUESTED
   ↓
RUNNING
   ↓
COMPLETED
   ↓
SUPERSEDED
   ↓
ARCHIVED
```

---

## Assessment Supersession

A new assessment may supersede an older assessment when:

```text
Target Changes
Profile Changes
Evidence Changes
Framework Changes
```

The old assessment should remain historically available where required.

---

## Risk Lifecycle Integration

Quality Framework evolution must account for existing risks.

A framework change may:

```text
Reduce Risk
Create New Risk
Change Risk Interpretation
Invalidate Mitigation
```

Impact analysis should account for this.

---

## Debt Lifecycle Integration

Framework evolution may create migration debt.

This debt should be explicit rather than hidden.

---

## Exception Lifecycle Integration

Exceptions may reference specific framework versions or requirements.

Framework evolution should determine whether exceptions:

```text
Remain Valid
Require Migration
Become Obsolete
Require Reapproval
```

---

## Compliance Lifecycle Integration

Compliance results depend on framework state.

A target compliant under:

```text
Framework v1
```

is not automatically compliant under:

```text
Framework v2
```

when mandatory requirements changed.

---

## Continuous Compliance During Migration

During migration, compliance reporting should clearly identify the profile and framework version used.

---

## Gate Lifecycle Integration

Gate behavior should not change silently during framework upgrades.

Changes should be versioned and communicated.

---

## Documentation Lifecycle Integration

Framework documentation must evolve together with implementation.

The unacceptable state is:

```text
Implementation v2
Documentation v1
```

when semantics differ.

---

## Documentation Synchronization

A framework change should identify required documentation updates.

---

## Reference Synchronization

Cross-framework references should be validated after significant lifecycle changes.

---

## Governance Lifecycle Integration

Governance determines:

```text
Who Approves Introduction
Who Approves Breaking Changes
Who Approves Deprecation
Who Approves Retirement
```

---

## Lifecycle Decision Record

Significant lifecycle transitions should be traceable.

Examples include:

```text
Rule Promotion
Profile Deprecation
Gate Enforcement
Framework Major Version
Framework Retirement
```

---

## Lifecycle Audit

Periodic audits may verify:

```text
Deprecated Capabilities Still Used
Retired Rules Still Referenced
Old Profiles Still Active
Stale Documentation
Expired Migration Windows
Unsupported Automation
```

---

## Lifecycle Findings

Examples include:

```text
Deprecated Rule Still Enforced
Retired Profile Referenced by CI
Unsupported Framework Version Active
Migration Deadline Missed
```

These should create Quality Findings.

---

## Framework Support Policy

FamilyOS may define which Quality Framework versions are supported.

Example:

```text
Current Major Version
      → Fully Supported

Previous Major Version
      → Migration Support

Older Versions
      → Unsupported
```

The exact policy may evolve.

---

## Support Levels

A conceptual support model may include:

```text
CURRENT
SUPPORTED
MIGRATION_ONLY
UNSUPPORTED
```

---

## CURRENT

The recommended framework version for new engineering work.

---

## SUPPORTED

Still maintained and valid.

---

## MIGRATION_ONLY

Supported only to facilitate migration.

---

## UNSUPPORTED

No longer appropriate for active engineering use.

---

## Compatibility Policy

Compatibility should be explicitly defined across framework versions.

Potential categories include:

```text
FULL
PARTIAL
MIGRATION_REQUIRED
INCOMPATIBLE
```

---

## Backward Compatibility

Backward compatibility is desirable when it does not compromise quality objectives.

It should not preserve harmful legacy behavior indefinitely.

---

## Forward Compatibility

Where practical, artifacts should avoid unnecessary coupling to one exact framework implementation.

---

## Framework Dependencies

The Quality Framework depends on other FamilyOS engineering foundations.

Potential dependencies include:

```text
Engineering Foundation
Testing Framework
Documentation Framework
Build Framework
Release Framework
Architecture Governance
Plugin Compliance Framework
```

Lifecycle changes must consider these dependencies.

---

## Dependency Change

A major change in a dependency may trigger Quality Framework reassessment.

Example:

```text
Testing Framework Major Change
      ↓
Quality Evidence Model Review
      ↓
Quality Gate Review
```

---

## Cross-Framework Lifecycle Coordination

Related frameworks should coordinate major lifecycle changes.

The objective is to avoid:

```text
Quality Framework v3
      ↓
requires capability
      ↓
Testing Framework v1 does not provide
```

---

## Framework Dependency Matrix

A future lifecycle registry may expose:

| Framework         | Depends On                  | Compatibility | Status |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- | ------------- | ------ |
| Quality Framework | Testing Framework           | Compatible    | Active |
| Quality Framework | Documentation Framework     | Compatible    | Active |
| Quality Framework | Plugin Compliance Framework | Compatible    | Active |

This improves lifecycle visibility.

---

## Framework Validation

Every significant lifecycle transition should include validation.

Examples:

```text
Introduction
      → capability validation

Enforcement
      → rule/gate validation

Migration
      → compatibility validation

Retirement
      → reference validation
```

---

## Lifecycle Quality Gates

The framework itself may use lifecycle gates.

Conceptually:

```text
Proposal Gate
      ↓
Adoption Gate
      ↓
Enforcement Gate
      ↓
Migration Gate
      ↓
Retirement Gate
```

These need not initially exist as automated systems.

---

## Proposal Gate

Checks whether the capability has sufficient justification and design.

---

## Adoption Gate

Checks whether the capability is ready for real engineering use.

---

## Enforcement Gate

Checks whether the capability is reliable enough to become authoritative.

---

## Migration Gate

Checks whether targets are ready to move to the new version.

---

## Retirement Gate

Checks whether the old capability can safely be removed.

---

## Framework Rollback

Framework changes should be reversible where practical.

Rollback may be necessary when:

```text
Critical Rule Failure
Unexpected Gate Blocking
Major Performance Regression
Invalid Compliance Results
```

---

## Rollback Principle

Rollback should restore a known valid state.

It should not erase evidence of the failed change.

---

## Emergency Framework Change

Critical quality or security problems may require accelerated framework changes.

The lifecycle remains:

```text
Emergency Need
      ↓
Accelerated Change
      ↓
Validation
      ↓
Deployment
      ↓
Mandatory Review
```

---

## Post-Emergency Lifecycle Review

After emergency changes, governance should determine:

```text
Was the change correct?

Should it remain permanent?

What documentation is missing?

What tests are required?

What lifecycle process should improve?
```

---

## Framework Lifecycle Metrics

Potential metrics include:

```text
Active Framework Versions
Deprecated Rules
Deprecated Profiles
Migration Completion
Legacy Usage
Framework Change Frequency
Rule Promotion Time
Deprecation Age
```

---

## Migration Completion

Migration completion may measure:

```text
Migrated Targets
/
Affected Targets
```

This should be supplemented by visibility into high-risk remaining targets.

---

## Deprecation Age

Long-lived deprecations may indicate incomplete lifecycle governance.

---

## Legacy Usage

Legacy usage should ideally decrease after replacement becomes available.

---

## Rule Promotion Time

Excessively long experimental states may indicate:

* insufficient evidence;
* unclear ownership;
* low priority;
* ineffective rule design.

---

## Framework Lifecycle Dashboard

A future dashboard may expose:

```text
Quality Framework

Current Version:          v2
Status:                   ACTIVE

Active Rules:             84
Experimental Rules:        6
Deprecated Rules:          4

Active Profiles:           7
Deprecated Profiles:       1

Migration Completion:     92%

Legacy Targets:            3

Framework Health:         HEALTHY
```

---

## Lifecycle Automation

Automation may assist with:

```text
Deprecated Usage Detection
Migration Tracking
Version Compatibility Validation
Reference Validation
Rule State Enforcement
Profile Validation
```

---

## Lifecycle CLI

A future CLI may conceptually provide:

```text
familyos quality framework status

familyos quality framework validate

familyos quality framework compatibility

familyos quality framework migrate

familyos quality framework deprecated
```

---

## Framework Status Example

```text
$ familyos quality framework status

Framework:
Quality Framework

Version:
2.0

Status:
ACTIVE

Health:
HEALTHY

Deprecated Rules:
4

Migration Required:
3 targets
```

---

## Lifecycle Registry

A future registry may contain:

```text
Framework
Version
Status
Support Level
Effective Date
Deprecation Date
Retirement Date
Dependencies
Migration
```

---

## AI-Assisted Lifecycle Management

AI may assist with:

* migration impact analysis;
* deprecated reference discovery;
* compatibility analysis;
* lifecycle report summarization;
* migration recommendations.

---

## AI Lifecycle Restrictions

AI must not independently:

```text
Promote Experimental Rules to Enforcement
Retire Mandatory Requirements
Declare Framework Compatibility
Approve Breaking Migrations
Change Framework Authority
```

unless future governance explicitly delegates such authority.

---

## Lifecycle Security

Framework lifecycle mechanisms affect authoritative quality controls.

They must therefore be protected against:

```text
Unauthorized Rule Promotion
Unauthorized Policy Retirement
Version Manipulation
Migration Bypass
Deprecated Control Reactivation
```

---

## Lifecycle Integrity

Authoritative lifecycle transitions should preserve:

```text
Artifact
Previous State
New State
Authority
Reason
Timestamp
Version
```

---

## Lifecycle Traceability

The complete lifecycle history should answer:

```text
When was this requirement introduced?

When did this rule become enforced?

Which framework version changed this profile?

Why was this gate deprecated?

When was this capability retired?

What replaced it?
```

---

## Framework Lifecycle Anti-Patterns

The FamilyOS Quality Framework rejects several lifecycle anti-patterns.

### Permanent Experimental State

Experimental capabilities must eventually be promoted, redesigned, or retired.

### Silent Enforcement

Rules must not become blocking without governed transition.

### Silent Breaking Change

Previously acceptable targets must not unexpectedly become invalid without migration consideration.

### Eternal Backward Compatibility

Legacy behavior must not be maintained indefinitely without justification.

### Deprecation Without Retirement

Deprecation must lead toward migration and eventual retirement.

### Retirement Without Migration

Critical capabilities should not disappear without a replacement or explicit decision.

### Version Without Meaning

Framework versions must represent understandable lifecycle states.

### Documentation Lag

Framework documentation must not remain materially behind implementation.

### Legacy Accumulation

Old rules, profiles, and tooling must not remain active indefinitely.

### Framework Growth Without Simplification

New capabilities should periodically be balanced by consolidation and retirement.

---

## Initial Lifecycle Model

The initial FamilyOS implementation can remain lightweight.

At minimum, it should support:

```text
Framework Version
Rule Status
Profile Status
Deprecation
Migration Documentation
Changelog
Validation
```

---

## Initial Rule States

An initial implementation may use:

```text
EXPERIMENTAL
ACTIVE
DEPRECATED
RETIRED
```

Additional observation and warning states may be introduced when enforcement becomes more automated.

---

## Initial Framework Metadata

A framework may initially expose:

```text
name
version
status
owner
dependencies
```

---

## Initial Lifecycle Documentation

The Quality Framework should maintain:

```text
README.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

alongside its normative chapters and metadata.

---

## Initial Migration Strategy

Early framework evolution should favor:

```text
Document Change
      ↓
Validate Impact
      ↓
Update Automation
      ↓
Run Full Quality Validation
      ↓
Commit
      ↓
Release / Tag
```

---

## Initial Retirement Strategy

Before retiring a capability:

```text
Search References
      ↓
Confirm Replacement
      ↓
Migrate Usage
      ↓
Validate
      ↓
Remove
      ↓
Update Documentation
```

---

## Lifecycle Maturity Model

The Quality Framework Lifecycle may mature through:

```text
Level 1
Manual Framework Evolution

    ↓

Level 2
Versioned Framework

    ↓

Level 3
Explicit Component Lifecycles

    ↓

Level 4
Managed Migration and Deprecation

    ↓

Level 5
Automated Compatibility Validation

    ↓

Level 6
Cross-Framework Lifecycle Coordination

    ↓

Level 7
Continuously Governed Quality Platform
```

---

## Continuous Framework Evolution

At high maturity, FamilyOS should continuously evolve the Quality Framework based on evidence while preserving stability.

The balance is:

```text
Stability
   +
Evolution
   +
Compatibility
   +
Governance
```

Too little evolution creates obsolescence.

Too much uncontrolled evolution creates instability.

---

## Relationship With Quality Metrics

Metrics provide evidence about framework effectiveness and adoption.

---

## Relationship With Quality Evidence

Evidence allows lifecycle decisions to be based on observed behavior rather than assumptions.

---

## Relationship With Quality Risk

Lifecycle changes may create or mitigate risk.

Risk should influence rollout and migration policy.

---

## Relationship With Defect and Quality Debt Management

Framework defects and framework debt should feed lifecycle evolution.

---

## Relationship With Quality Reviews and Assessments

Reviews and assessments provide major inputs to framework evolution decisions.

---

## Relationship With Quality Automation

Automation implements many framework capabilities and must evolve consistently with policy.

---

## Relationship With Quality Observability

Observability provides visibility into framework health, adoption, failures, and migration progress.

---

## Relationship With Quality Gates

Gate policies have explicit lifecycles and may change as framework maturity increases.

---

## Relationship With Quality Compliance

Compliance semantics depend on framework versions, requirements, profiles, and rules.

Lifecycle management preserves historical interpretation.

---

## Relationship With Continuous Improvement

Continuous Improvement identifies what should change.

The Quality Framework Lifecycle defines how that change is introduced safely.

The relationship is:

```text
Continuous Improvement
      ↓
Improvement Proposal
      ↓
Lifecycle Governance
      ↓
Framework Evolution
```

---

## Relationship With Quality Governance

Quality Governance defines the authority for lifecycle transitions.

The Quality Framework Lifecycle defines the mechanics of those transitions.

---

## Relationship With Engineering Foundation

The Engineering Foundation establishes broader FamilyOS engineering lifecycle principles.

The Quality Framework Lifecycle specializes those principles for quality capabilities.

---

## Relationship With Testing Framework

Testing changes may affect:

```text
Evidence
Metrics
Quality Gates
Compliance
```

Cross-framework lifecycle coordination is therefore required.

---

## Relationship With Documentation Framework

Documentation lifecycle rules ensure Quality Framework documentation evolves with implementation.

---

## Relationship With Build Framework

Build lifecycle changes may affect quality verification and evidence generation.

---

## Relationship With Release Framework

Quality Framework releases should align with FamilyOS release governance, versioning, tagging, and changelog principles.

---

## Relationship With Plugin Compliance Framework

Plugin compliance profiles and rules may evolve alongside the Quality Framework.

Compatibility between framework versions must remain explicit.

---

## Reference Quality Framework Lifecycle

The complete lifecycle can be represented as:

```text
Engineering Need
      ↓
Quality Capability Proposal
      ↓
Design
      ↓
Review
      ↓
Governance Approval
      ↓
Implementation
      ↓
Validation
      ↓
Pilot
      ↓
Observation
      ↓
Warning
      ↓
Enforcement
      ↓
Stable Operation
      ↓
Quality Observability
      ↓
Framework Assessment
      ↓
Continuous Improvement
      ↓
Framework Change
      ↓
Versioning
      ↓
Migration
      ↓
Compatibility Management
      ↓
Deprecation
      ↓
Retirement
      ↓
Historical Preservation
```

This lifecycle repeats for every significant evolution of the Quality Framework.

---

## Strategic Outcome

The Quality Framework Lifecycle enables FamilyOS to move from:

```text
Quality rules are added when needed.

Old rules remain because removing them is risky.

Framework changes happen incrementally without
a clear migration model.
```

toward:

```text
Every authoritative quality capability has an
explicit lifecycle.

New capabilities are introduced progressively.

Rules become authoritative only after validation.

Breaking changes receive migration plans.

Framework versions preserve historical meaning.

Deprecated mechanisms move toward retirement.

Obsolete controls are removed deliberately.

The framework evolves continuously without
sacrificing engineering stability.
```

This allows FamilyOS to maintain a quality system that can survive long-term architectural and organizational evolution.

---

## Final Quality Framework Lifecycle Principle

A quality framework that cannot evolve safely eventually becomes either obsolete or unstable.

FamilyOS therefore treats lifecycle management as a fundamental quality capability.

The Quality Framework Lifecycle establishes the relationship:

```text
Need
  ↓
Design
  ↓
Validate
  ↓
Adopt
  ↓
Enforce
  ↓
Operate
  ↓
Observe
  ↓
Improve
  ↓
Evolve
  ↓
Migrate
  ↓
Deprecate
  ↓
Retire
  ↓
Preserve History
```

Through explicit lifecycle states, incremental adoption, evidence-based promotion, controlled enforcement, versioning, compatibility management, migration, deprecation, retirement, framework health monitoring, cross-framework coordination, governance, and continuous improvement, the Quality Framework can remain authoritative, understandable, efficient, maintainable, and aligned with FamilyOS throughout the lifetime of the platform.
