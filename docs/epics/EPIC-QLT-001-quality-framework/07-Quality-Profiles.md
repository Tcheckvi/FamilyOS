# Quality Framework

## 07 Quality Profiles

### Overview

The FamilyOS Quality Profile model defines how quality requirements are assembled, specialized, and applied to different categories of engineering targets.

A quality profile represents a reusable set of quality expectations.

It determines:

* which quality domains apply;
* which requirements are mandatory;
* which rules are enabled;
* which checks must execute;
* which thresholds apply;
* which severities are blocking;
* which evidence is required;
* which quality gates are active;
* which exceptions are permitted.

Quality Profiles allow FamilyOS to preserve a common quality foundation while adapting assurance depth to context, criticality, risk, and lifecycle stage.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of Quality Profiles is to prevent two equally problematic extremes.

The first extreme is uniform enforcement.

```text id="bwvl7q"
Every Component
      ↓
Exactly the Same Quality Rules
```

This model ignores differences in risk, purpose, lifecycle stage, and operational importance.

The second extreme is uncontrolled customization.

```text id="j58fcb"
Every Component
      ↓
Independent Quality Configuration
      ↓
Inconsistent Standards
```

Quality Profiles provide a controlled middle ground.

```text id="5lwjd6"
FamilyOS Quality Baseline
        ↓
Reusable Quality Profiles
        ↓
Target-Specific Application
```

---

## Profile Definition

A Quality Profile is a versioned quality configuration that describes the assurance expectations for a defined category of target.

Conceptually:

```text id="hv8gg2"
Quality Profile
      =
Applicable Domains
      +
Required Rules
      +
Thresholds
      +
Gate Policies
      +
Evidence Requirements
      +
Exception Policies
```

A profile defines what quality means for a specific engineering context.

---

## Profile Principles

Quality Profiles must remain:

* explicit;
* versioned;
* traceable;
* composable;
* deterministic;
* risk-aware;
* governance-controlled;
* compatible with inheritance;
* independent from individual tools.

A profile must describe quality expectations rather than CI implementation details.

---

## Profile Identity

Each profile should have a stable identifier.

A conceptual format may be:

```text id="84ahm6"
QLT-PROFILE-<NAME>
```

Examples:

```text id="wxceeb"
QLT-PROFILE-BASE
QLT-PROFILE-CORE
QLT-PROFILE-PLUGIN
QLT-PROFILE-DOCS
QLT-PROFILE-RELEASE
```

The exact naming convention may evolve.

Identifiers must remain stable and unique.

---

## Profile Metadata

A Quality Profile may contain metadata such as:

```text id="y9muc2"
id
name
description
version
status
owner
parent_profiles
applicability
domains
rules
thresholds
gates
evidence_requirements
exception_policy
```

This metadata should eventually support both machine-readable and human-readable representations.

---

## Profile Scope

Profiles may apply to different scopes.

Examples include:

```text id="gkutst"
File
Module
Package
Capability
Plugin
Repository
Build
Release
Platform
```

A profile may also target categories rather than individual resources.

Example:

```text id="i52avq"
All Official Plugins
```

or:

```text id="hl3h8c"
All Release Candidates
```

---

## Baseline Quality Profile

FamilyOS should define a Baseline Quality Profile.

The baseline establishes minimum quality expectations that apply broadly across engineering artifacts.

Conceptually:

```text id="42kl21"
Baseline Profile
      ↓
Architecture
Maintainability
Testing
Documentation
Security
Basic Compliance
```

The exact requirements vary by target applicability.

The baseline represents the minimum accepted FamilyOS engineering quality model.

---

## Baseline Preservation

Specialized profiles may strengthen the baseline.

They must not silently remove mandatory baseline requirements.

The preferred model is:

```text id="kkhb8x"
Baseline
   ↓
Specialized Profile
   ↓
Additional Requirements
```

rather than:

```text id="ssohxx"
Specialized Profile
   ↓
Unknown Subset of Baseline
```

Any permitted weakening must require explicit governance.

---

## Core Platform Profile

The Core Platform Profile applies to foundational FamilyOS components.

These components may include:

* domain core;
* architecture infrastructure;
* plugin runtime;
* configuration system;
* generation framework;
* CLI core;
* shared contracts.

Because failures may affect large areas of the ecosystem, the profile should require strong assurance.

Possible expectations include:

```text id="ev5jud"
Strict Architecture Validation
Strict Type Verification
Broad Automated Testing
Security Validation
Compatibility Protection
Documentation Requirements
Strong Release Gates
```

---

## Official Plugin Profile

The Official Plugin Profile applies to FamilyOS maintained plugins.

It builds upon the baseline and may include:

* plugin architecture compliance;
* capability validation;
* manifest validation;
* domain isolation;
* test requirements;
* documentation completeness;
* compatibility requirements;
* security requirements.

Conceptually:

```text id="5ext4u"
Base Profile
      +
Plugin Compliance
      +
Capability Validation
      +
Plugin Documentation
      =
Official Plugin Profile
```

---

## Internal Component Profile

An Internal Component Profile may apply to non-public implementation components.

It may require:

* correctness;
* maintainability;
* testing;
* architecture compliance;
* basic documentation;
* dependency control.

Compatibility requirements may be lighter than for public interfaces.

Risk still determines actual enforcement.

---

## Documentation Profile

The Documentation Profile applies to documentation-focused targets.

Relevant domains may include:

```text id="kdrlrx"
Documentation
Compliance
Architecture
Governance
Compatibility
```

Potential requirements include:

* required metadata;
* valid references;
* required structure;
* lifecycle status;
* naming conventions;
* traceability;
* versioning.

Runtime-specific rules may be `NOT_APPLICABLE`.

---

## Infrastructure Profile

The Infrastructure Profile applies to CI, deployment, development, or runtime infrastructure.

It may emphasize:

* reproducibility;
* security;
* configuration integrity;
* reliability;
* observability;
* dependency control;
* documentation;
* recovery behavior.

Infrastructure failures may affect the complete engineering platform and should therefore receive appropriate assurance.

---

## Experimental Profile

The Experimental Profile supports early-stage development.

It may relax selected enforcement mechanisms while preserving critical safety requirements.

Typical behavior may include:

```text id="vr0h9e"
Mandatory Security Rules
      → Enforced

Critical Architecture Rules
      → Enforced

Emerging Maintainability Rules
      → Advisory

Experimental Metrics
      → Informational
```

Experimental must not mean uncontrolled.

---

## Production Profile

The Production Profile applies to components intended for normal operational use.

It should provide stronger assurance than development or experimental profiles.

It may require:

* full required testing;
* security validation;
* architecture compliance;
* dependency validation;
* documentation;
* compatibility;
* observability expectations.

---

## Release Candidate Profile

The Release Candidate Profile applies to artifacts approaching release.

This profile may be stricter than normal development profiles.

It may enable:

```text id="clxqwi"
Full Test Suite
Security Validation
Compatibility Validation
Documentation Validation
Build Reproducibility
Release Metadata Validation
Complete Quality Evidence
```

Release Candidate profiles are typically associated with Release Gates.

---

## Critical Component Profile

A Critical Component Profile may strengthen requirements for components with elevated risk.

Criticality may originate from:

* security sensitivity;
* identity handling;
* data integrity;
* platform-wide dependency;
* operational impact;
* persistence responsibilities.

A Critical Component Profile may require:

* additional reviews;
* stricter severity thresholds;
* broader testing;
* stronger evidence;
* reduced exception flexibility.

---

## Profile Composition

Profiles should support composition where practical.

Example:

```text id="zys3gl"
Official Plugin Profile
      =
Baseline Profile
      +
Plugin Compliance Profile
      +
Production Profile
```

Composition should avoid duplicating rule definitions.

---

## Profile Inheritance

A profile may inherit from one or more parent profiles.

Example:

```text id="u11w79"
Baseline
   ↓
Production
   ↓
Official Plugin
```

Inheritance means child profiles receive parent requirements unless explicitly governed otherwise.

---

## Multiple Inheritance

If multiple profile inheritance is allowed, conflicts must be resolved deterministically.

Example:

```text id="s52rt8"
Baseline
   ├── Security Profile
   └── Plugin Profile
          ↓
Official Security Plugin Profile
```

The framework must define how:

* duplicate rules;
* conflicting thresholds;
* severity overrides;
* gate policies;

are resolved.

---

## Profile Precedence

Profile configuration precedence must be explicit.

A possible model is:

```text id="4c2ntf"
Framework Baseline
      ↓
Inherited Profiles
      ↓
Specialized Profile
      ↓
Approved Target Override
      ↓
Approved Exception
```

Lower-precedence configuration must not silently weaken mandatory requirements.

---

## Profile Rules

A profile may declare:

```text id="6yozss"
required_rules
optional_rules
disabled_rules
advisory_rules
```

However, mandatory baseline rules must be protected from unauthorized disabling.

---

## Required Rules

Required rules must execute when applicable.

Failure behavior is determined by:

* severity;
* profile configuration;
* gate policy;
* lifecycle stage.

Required does not necessarily mean blocking in every context.

---

## Optional Rules

Optional rules may provide additional assurance.

They may be enabled by:

* repository policy;
* target criticality;
* lifecycle stage;
* experimentation.

Optional rules must remain explicit.

---

## Advisory Rules

Profiles may convert selected rules into advisory behavior.

Example:

```text id="pt8jhj"
Complexity Rule
      ↓
Development Profile → WARNING
Release Profile     → FAIL
```

Such behavior must remain traceable.

---

## Rule Disabling

Rule disabling must be controlled.

A profile may only disable a rule when:

* the rule is optional;
* the profile is explicitly authorized;
* applicability makes the rule irrelevant.

Disabling must not be used as an untracked substitute for exceptions.

---

## Profile Domains

Profiles should specify applicable quality domains.

Example:

```text id="p0wh0q"
Official Plugin Profile

Domains:
Correctness
Architecture
Security
Testing
Documentation
Compatibility
Compliance
Dependencies
```

Domain selection improves clarity and quality reporting.

---

## Domain Criticality in Profiles

A profile may assign different criticality levels to domains.

Example:

```text id="yx5d7w"
Official Security Plugin Profile

Security        CRITICAL
Correctness     CRITICAL
Architecture    HIGH
Testing         HIGH
Documentation   STANDARD
```

Domain criticality may influence gate behavior and evidence depth.

---

## Profile Thresholds

Profiles may specialize thresholds.

Examples:

```text id="3cxws2"
minimum_coverage
maximum_complexity
maximum_allowed_security_severity
maximum_build_duration
minimum_documentation_completeness
```

Thresholds must be:

* explicit;
* measurable;
* justified;
* versioned.

---

## Threshold Inheritance

A specialized profile may strengthen inherited thresholds.

Example:

```text id="q4mnwj"
Baseline Coverage Threshold
      80%

Critical Component Profile
      90%
```

Weakening inherited thresholds should require explicit authorization.

---

## Profile Evidence Requirements

Profiles may define the evidence required for an assessment.

Examples:

```text id="9sc4lr"
Unit Test Evidence
Integration Test Evidence
Static Analysis Evidence
Architecture Evidence
Security Evidence
Documentation Evidence
Build Evidence
```

A profile should distinguish between:

```text id="y9qfu3"
Required Evidence
Optional Evidence
Informational Evidence
```

---

## Missing Evidence

Missing required evidence must not silently imply success.

A profile should define how missing evidence behaves.

Possible outcomes include:

```text id="oxegj4"
ERROR
FAIL
CONDITIONAL_PASS
```

The exact result depends on gate semantics and risk.

---

## Profile Gate Definitions

Profiles may activate quality gates.

Example:

```text id="pohjeu"
Development Profile
      ↓
Developer Gate

Production Profile
      ↓
Merge Gate
Integration Gate

Release Candidate Profile
      ↓
Release Gate
```

Gate behavior should be reusable across profile categories.

---

## Profile Severity Policy

Profiles may define how finding severities affect decisions.

Example:

```text id="c2r53o"
INFO       → report
LOW        → report
MEDIUM     → warning
HIGH       → block merge
CRITICAL   → block all progression
```

These semantics may differ by lifecycle stage.

---

## Severity Escalation

A profile may escalate the effective importance of certain findings.

Example:

```text id="s32hgj"
Compatibility MEDIUM
```

may behave as `HIGH` for a public API release profile.

The original finding severity should remain preserved.

The profile modifies decision behavior, not historical evidence.

---

## Profile Criticality

Profiles may define target criticality.

A conceptual model may include:

```text id="4ba3b0"
LOW
STANDARD
HIGH
CRITICAL
```

Criticality affects required assurance depth.

---

## Criticality Resolution

Criticality may be derived from:

* target classification;
* data sensitivity;
* architectural importance;
* security role;
* public exposure;
* operational consequences.

Criticality should not rely solely on manual guesswork.

---

## Profile Applicability

The system must determine which profiles apply to a target.

Inputs may include:

```text id="moymwe"
Target Type
Component Metadata
Lifecycle Stage
Criticality
Repository Policy
Plugin Classification
```

Applicability resolution must be deterministic.

---

## Profile Resolution

A target may resolve to one or more profiles.

Conceptually:

```text id="jgw55m"
Target Metadata
       ↓
Profile Resolver
       ↓
Applicable Profiles
       ↓
Effective Quality Configuration
```

The effective configuration must be inspectable.

---

## Effective Profile

The Effective Profile is the final resolved quality configuration for a target.

It includes all inherited and composed expectations.

Example:

```text id="d9o15v"
Effective Profile
      ↓
Domains
Rules
Thresholds
Evidence Requirements
Gates
Exception Policy
```

The effective profile should be reproducible from configuration and profile versions.

---

## Profile Resolution Trace

FamilyOS should eventually be able to explain:

```text id="ld1k17"
Why did this rule apply?

Which profile enabled it?

Which parent profile introduced it?

Which threshold is effective?

Which override changed the behavior?
```

This trace is essential for debugging quality decisions.

---

## Profile Conflict Detection

Profiles may create configuration conflicts.

Examples include:

```text id="1nvtzq"
Profile A:
minimum_coverage = 80

Profile B:
minimum_coverage = 90
```

or:

```text id="r8tarr"
Profile A:
Rule X required

Profile B:
Rule X disabled
```

Conflict resolution must be explicit.

Silent arbitrary resolution is not acceptable.

---

## Conflict Resolution Strategy

For compatible constraints, the framework should generally prefer the stricter requirement.

Example:

```text id="xlrxml"
80% minimum
+
90% minimum
=
90% effective minimum
```

However, not all conflicts are mathematically resolvable.

Semantic conflicts should produce configuration errors requiring governance.

---

## Profile Overrides

Profiles may support authorized overrides.

Overrides should define:

* target;
* profile;
* property;
* previous value;
* new value;
* rationale;
* owner.

Overrides must be version-controlled when authoritative.

---

## Profile Override vs Exception

Overrides and exceptions serve different purposes.

```text id="j116p6"
Profile Override
      ↓
Changes the effective quality configuration

Exception
      ↓
Allows temporary deviation from an active requirement
```

Overrides should be used for legitimate configuration differences.

Exceptions should be used for controlled non-compliance.

---

## Exception Policies

A profile may define its default exception policy.

Examples:

```text id="v34f6d"
PERMITTED
APPROVAL_REQUIRED
TIME_BOUND
NOT_ALLOWED
```

Critical profiles should normally require stronger governance.

---

## Profile-Specific Exceptions

An exception may reference both a rule and the active profile.

Example:

```text id="6h2189"
Rule:
QLT-RULE-PER-004

Profile:
QLT-PROFILE-RELEASE

Exception:
Approved until next release
```

This prevents an exception from unintentionally affecting other contexts.

---

## Development Profile

A Development Profile should optimize fast feedback while preserving essential protection.

It may include:

```text id="2bkggp"
Formatting
Linting
Type Verification
Focused Unit Tests
Basic Architecture Validation
Basic Documentation Validation
```

Deep checks may execute less frequently.

---

## Merge Profile

A Merge Profile may strengthen validation before code enters a protected branch.

Possible requirements include:

```text id="4p6eq7"
Required Tests
Static Analysis
Type Verification
Architecture Validation
Changed Documentation Validation
No Blocking Findings
```

---

## Integration Profile

An Integration Profile may emphasize component interaction.

Possible checks include:

* integration tests;
* contract tests;
* dependency checks;
* plugin interaction checks;
* compatibility validation.

---

## Full Verification Profile

A Full Verification Profile executes the complete applicable quality suite.

It may be used for:

* scheduled validation;
* release preparation;
* architecture audits;
* major changes.

This profile prioritizes assurance over immediate feedback speed.

---

## Fast Profile

A Fast Profile prioritizes development feedback.

It should contain only checks that are:

* high value;
* deterministic;
* fast enough for frequent execution.

Fast profiles must not be confused with complete assurance.

---

## Security-Sensitive Profile

A Security-Sensitive Profile may strengthen:

* dependency scanning;
* secrets detection;
* authentication testing;
* authorization testing;
* configuration checks;
* review requirements.

Security-sensitive targets may permit fewer exceptions.

---

## Public API Profile

A Public API Profile may strengthen compatibility requirements.

Possible rules include:

* contract stability;
* schema compatibility;
* deprecation policy;
* versioning requirements;
* documentation completeness.

Breaking changes may trigger stronger release controls.

---

## Persistent Data Profile

A Persistent Data Profile may emphasize:

* migration correctness;
* backward compatibility;
* data integrity;
* rollback behavior;
* schema versioning;
* recovery validation.

Targets that manage durable data require stronger assurance because failures may be irreversible.

---

## Plugin Capability Profile

A Plugin Capability Profile may apply specifically to externally consumable capabilities.

It may require:

* contract validation;
* type completeness;
* documentation;
* compatibility;
* deterministic behavior;
* security checks.

---

## Profile Lifecycle

Profiles must have a controlled lifecycle.

A baseline lifecycle may include:

```text id="zw2ycx"
DRAFT
  ↓
EXPERIMENTAL
  ↓
ACTIVE
  ↓
DEPRECATED
  ↓
RETIRED
```

Profile lifecycle changes must be governed.

---

## Draft Profiles

Draft profiles are under design.

They should not define authoritative quality behavior unless explicitly enabled in test environments.

---

## Experimental Profiles

Experimental profiles allow evaluation of new quality configurations.

They may be used to assess:

* execution cost;
* developer impact;
* rule interactions;
* false positives;
* threshold suitability.

---

## Active Profiles

Active profiles are part of the authoritative Quality Framework.

They must be versioned, documented, and supported.

---

## Deprecated Profiles

Deprecated profiles remain temporarily available for migration purposes.

They should identify a recommended replacement.

---

## Retired Profiles

Retired profiles are no longer active.

Their identifiers must not be reused.

Historical quality evidence must remain interpretable.

---

## Profile Versioning

Profiles should be versioned when effective quality behavior changes materially.

Examples include:

* added mandatory rules;
* removed rules;
* changed thresholds;
* changed gate policy;
* changed inheritance;
* changed exception policy.

Versioning is essential because the same source state may produce different results under different profiles.

---

## Profile Semantic Versioning

A profile versioning model may eventually distinguish:

```text id="okiycq"
Major
      → incompatible quality behavior change

Minor
      → additive or stronger compatible requirement

Patch
      → non-semantic correction
```

The exact versioning model should align with broader FamilyOS governance.

---

## Profile Change Impact

Profile changes may affect many components simultaneously.

Before activation, FamilyOS should evaluate:

```text id="b5aasq"
How many targets are affected?

Which new rules become active?

Which gates may fail?

How much execution time is added?

How many existing findings become blocking?
```

This supports controlled rollout.

---

## Progressive Profile Rollout

Stricter profiles may be introduced progressively.

Example:

```text id="4iexs3"
Experimental
      ↓
Advisory
      ↓
Block New Violations
      ↓
Full Enforcement
```

Progressive rollout reduces disruption.

---

## Profile Baselines

Profiles may use quality baselines.

Example:

```text id="y9xj7v"
Legacy Repository
      ↓
Production Profile
      ↓
Existing Findings Baselined
      ↓
New Findings Blocked
```

Baselining must support improvement rather than permanent debt acceptance.

---

## Profile Metrics

Profiles may define required quality metrics.

Example:

```text id="nnd0ia"
Release Candidate Profile

Required Metrics:
Test Coverage
Test Pass Rate
Security Finding Count
Documentation Completeness
Build Reproducibility
```

Metrics should support decisions rather than become arbitrary scoring systems.

---

## Profile Quality Reports

Quality reports should identify the profile used.

Example:

```text id="xopn1z"
Target:
Official Finance Plugin

Effective Profile:
QLT-PROFILE-OFFICIAL-PLUGIN v2.1

Result:
PASS
```

Without profile identification, results may be difficult to interpret.

---

## Profile Comparison

The framework should eventually support profile comparison.

Example:

```text id="7cnbsd"
Development Profile
      ↓
14 active rules

Release Profile
      ↓
29 active rules
```

A comparison should expose:

* added rules;
* removed rules;
* threshold changes;
* gate changes;
* evidence changes.

---

## Profile Inspection

Engineers should be able to inspect the effective profile before executing quality checks.

Conceptually:

```text id="goor8t"
familyos quality profile show
```

may expose:

```text id="q06yd4"
Active Profiles
Inherited Profiles
Applicable Rules
Thresholds
Gates
Exception Policies
```

The specific CLI design remains an implementation decision.

---

## Profile Discovery

Profiles should be discoverable through the Quality Registry.

A registry may expose:

```text id="dwdbv1"
ID
Name
Status
Version
Parents
Applicable Targets
Owner
```

This improves governance and usability.

---

## Profile Registry

Conceptually:

```text id="hg4959"
Quality Registry
      ↓
Profile Registry
      ├── Baseline
      ├── Development
      ├── Production
      ├── Core
      ├── Official Plugin
      ├── Documentation
      └── Release
```

The registry should include historical versions where required for auditability.

---

## Profile Ownership

Every active profile must have ownership.

Profile owners are responsible for:

* semantics;
* lifecycle;
* inheritance;
* rule selection;
* threshold configuration;
* gate policies;
* exception defaults.

Unowned profiles must not become authoritative.

---

## Profile Review

Before activation, profiles should be reviewed for:

```text id="ip9i89"
Appropriate Scope
Rule Completeness
Conflict Safety
Execution Cost
Risk Coverage
Threshold Validity
Exception Policy
Developer Impact
```

Reviews reduce unintended framework behavior.

---

## Profile Validation

Machine-readable profile definitions should be validated.

Validation may verify:

* unique identifier;
* valid parent references;
* valid rule references;
* supported domain identifiers;
* valid threshold types;
* valid gate references;
* absence of inheritance cycles.

Invalid profiles must not become active.

---

## Inheritance Cycle Prevention

Profile inheritance must never contain cycles.

Invalid:

```text id="la8evy"
Profile A
   ↓
Profile B
   ↓
Profile C
   ↓
Profile A
```

Profile loaders must detect and reject such configurations.

---

## Profile Testing

Profiles should be tested.

Tests may validate:

* effective rule resolution;
* inheritance;
* conflict handling;
* threshold precedence;
* gate behavior;
* exception behavior;
* profile applicability.

Golden profile fixtures may preserve expected behavior.

---

## Profile Determinism

Given equivalent:

```text id="0n9s3a"
Target Metadata
Profile Versions
Repository Configuration
Lifecycle Stage
```

the effective quality configuration should be identical.

Profile resolution must not depend on undocumented environmental state.

---

## Profile Portability

Profiles should be reusable across repositories or components when their semantics match.

Tool-specific implementation configuration should remain separate from reusable quality intent where practical.

This improves ecosystem consistency.

---

## Repository Quality Configuration

Repositories may select or extend approved profiles.

Conceptually:

```text id="8g88n2"
Repository
      ↓
Profile Assignment
      ↓
Approved Local Configuration
```

Repositories must not redefine core quality semantics arbitrarily.

---

## Target-Level Profile Assignment

Specific targets may require stronger profiles.

Example:

```text id="fpdi0x"
Repository Profile:
Production

Target:
security/authentication

Additional Profile:
Critical Component
```

Effective configuration becomes the composition of both.

---

## Automatic Profile Assignment

Some profiles may be assigned automatically based on metadata.

Example:

```text id="i4b463"
plugin.type = official
      ↓
Official Plugin Profile
```

or:

```text id="1axfqz"
release_candidate = true
      ↓
Release Candidate Profile
```

Automatic assignment rules must be explicit and inspectable.

---

## Manual Profile Assignment

Manual assignment may be required for special cases.

Manual assignment should be version-controlled and reviewed where it affects authoritative quality behavior.

---

## Profile Drift

Profile drift occurs when different repositories progressively customize profiles until common quality expectations disappear.

The framework must prevent uncontrolled profile drift through:

* central baseline inheritance;
* governed overrides;
* profile registries;
* configuration validation;
* reporting.

---

## Profile Duplication

Repositories should not copy profiles locally merely to make small modifications.

Preferred:

```text id="vk43qq"
Central Profile
      +
Small Approved Override
```

Avoid:

```text id="v96whh"
Copied Profile
      ↓
Independent Evolution
```

Duplication makes governance difficult.

---

## Profile Security

Quality profiles are security-sensitive configuration.

Changing a profile could disable important checks or gates.

Authoritative profile changes must therefore be:

* version-controlled;
* reviewed;
* traceable;
* protected by repository governance.

---

## Profile Reliability

Profile resolution failure must not silently fall back to weaker assurance.

Example:

```text id="gbup04"
Unable to resolve Release Profile
```

must not automatically become:

```text id="0q46od"
Use Development Profile instead
```

unless an explicit failover policy exists.

---

## Fail-Safe Profile Behavior

For critical contexts:

```text id="3v93xi"
Unknown Profile
Invalid Profile
Conflicting Profile
```

should prevent authoritative quality approval.

The framework should prefer visible configuration failure over silent weakening.

---

## Profile Performance

Profiles influence execution cost.

A profile should balance:

```text id="286zid"
Required Assurance
      ↕
Feedback Time
```

This is why separate fast, standard, full, and release-oriented profiles may exist.

---

## Profile and Execution Mode Separation

Quality Profiles and execution modes are related but different.

A profile defines:

```text id="mt1t91"
What quality is required.
```

An execution mode defines:

```text id="5dx4t1"
How much of that verification is executed in a particular workflow.
```

The framework must avoid conflating these concepts.

---

## Example

A Production Profile may require thirty rules.

A developer FAST execution may run twelve immediately.

The remaining checks may execute in CI.

The authoritative merge or release decision must still ensure all required evidence eventually exists.

---

## Profile and Gate Separation

Profiles define expectations.

Gates define lifecycle decisions.

```text id="89ijd6"
Profile
      ↓
Required Quality State

Gate
      ↓
Can the transition proceed?
```

A single profile may participate in several gates.

---

## Profile and Risk Model

Profiles operationalize risk-based quality.

Conceptually:

```text id="qk78jo"
Risk Classification
       ↓
Profile Selection
       ↓
Assurance Depth
```

Higher risk generally results in stronger profiles.

---

## Profile and Compliance

Compliance frameworks may contribute specialized profiles.

Example:

```text id="f8zl8m"
Official Plugin Compliance
      ↓
Plugin Compliance Profile
      ↓
Composed With
      ↓
Official Plugin Quality Profile
```

This allows compliance rules to integrate without duplicating the Quality Framework.

---

## Profile and Testing Framework

Testing expectations should be referenced through quality requirements derived from the Testing Framework.

Profiles may determine:

* required testing levels;
* required test evidence;
* minimum coverage expectations;
* required execution scope.

They must not redefine testing methodology.

---

## Profile and Documentation Framework

Documentation profiles may consume requirements defined by the Documentation Framework.

Examples include:

* required control documents;
* metadata validation;
* lifecycle status;
* traceability;
* completeness.

---

## Profile and Build Framework

Build-related profiles may require:

* reproducible builds;
* successful artifact creation;
* integrity validation;
* dependency resolution evidence.

These requirements become especially important for release profiles.

---

## Profile and Release Framework

Release profiles provide quality prerequisites for Release Framework transitions.

Conceptually:

```text id="8wzbsc"
Release Candidate
      ↓
Release Quality Profile
      ↓
Quality Assessment
      ↓
Release Gate
      ↓
Release Framework Decision
```

---

## Profile Observability

The framework should eventually expose profile usage metrics.

Examples:

```text id="7br926"
Targets per Profile
Profile Failure Rate
Average Check Duration
Exception Count
Rule Activation Count
```

This information helps evaluate profile effectiveness.

---

## Profile Effectiveness

Profiles should be periodically assessed.

Questions include:

```text id="k2qgr9"
Does the profile detect meaningful risk?

Are too many rules irrelevant?

Are developers frequently requesting exceptions?

Is execution too slow?

Are important domains missing?

Are thresholds realistic?
```

Profiles must evolve based on evidence.

---

## Profile Complexity

Profiles should remain understandable.

Excessive inheritance and override chains can create opaque behavior.

The framework should favor:

```text id="976feh"
Simple Composition
Explicit Configuration
Inspectable Resolution
```

over deep configuration hierarchies.

---

## Profile Anti-Patterns

The Quality Profile model rejects several anti-patterns.

### One Universal Profile

A single profile cannot represent every quality context effectively.

### Per-Repository Reinvention

Repositories must not independently recreate quality standards.

### Hidden Profile Overrides

Effective behavior must remain inspectable.

### Silent Weakening

Specialized profiles must not silently remove mandatory baseline requirements.

### Excessive Inheritance

Complex inheritance chains reduce explainability.

### Profile as Tool Configuration

A profile defines quality expectations, not raw tool command lines.

### Permanent Experimental Profile

Experimental profiles must not become permanent substitutes for production assurance.

---

## Example — Official Plugin

Consider an official Finance plugin.

Its effective profile might be:

```text id="gt4uya"
Baseline Profile
      +
Production Profile
      +
Official Plugin Profile
```

Relevant domains may include:

```text id="28wvcb"
Correctness
Architecture
Maintainability
Security
Testing
Documentation
Compatibility
Dependencies
Compliance
```

The effective profile determines all applicable quality verification.

---

## Example — Documentation EPIC

An EPIC documentation directory may resolve to:

```text id="spna6z"
Baseline Documentation Profile
      +
EPIC Documentation Profile
```

Relevant checks may include:

* required control files;
* naming conventions;
* metadata validity;
* structural consistency;
* reference validation;
* lifecycle completeness.

Runtime performance rules may be `NOT_APPLICABLE`.

---

## Example — Release Candidate

A release candidate may resolve to:

```text id="02sm1f"
Production Profile
      +
Release Candidate Profile
```

This may activate:

```text id="j6m9k8"
Full Test Evidence
Build Evidence
Security Evidence
Compatibility Evidence
Documentation Evidence
Release Metadata Validation
```

The Release Gate then evaluates the resulting assessment.

---

## Reference Profile Resolution Model

```text id="ar58mm"
                Target Metadata
                      +
              Lifecycle Context
                      +
             Repository Policy
                      ↓
                Profile Resolver
                      ↓
             Applicable Profiles
                      ↓
           Inheritance & Composition
                      ↓
             Conflict Resolution
                      ↓
               Effective Profile
                      ↓
          Applicable Quality Rules
                      ↓
              Quality Execution
                      ↓
                 Evidence
                      ↓
                Assessment
                      ↓
                   Gates
```

This is the core runtime model of Quality Profiles.

---

## Strategic Outcome

Quality Profiles provide the mechanism required to scale quality assurance across a heterogeneous ecosystem.

They allow FamilyOS to answer:

```text id="2p7ahv"
What level of quality assurance applies here?

Which rules must execute?

Which domains matter?

Which thresholds apply?

Which evidence is required?

Which findings are blocking?

Which gate must pass?
```

Without profiles, these answers would depend on fragmented local configuration.

With profiles, they become explicit and governable.

---

## Final Profile Principle

Quality must be consistent without being inflexible.

The FamilyOS Quality Profile model therefore establishes a controlled mechanism for adapting assurance depth to engineering context while preserving shared platform standards.

Profiles provide the bridge between:

```text id="mt5e9y"
Universal Quality Principles
          ↓
Reusable Quality Requirements
          ↓
Context-Specific Assurance
```

Through explicit inheritance, composition, risk sensitivity, evidence requirements, and gate policies, Quality Profiles make the FamilyOS Quality Framework adaptable, scalable, reproducible, and governable across the complete engineering ecosystem.
