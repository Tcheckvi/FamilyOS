## Overview

EPIC-QLT-001 establishes the authoritative Quality Framework for the FamilyOS engineering ecosystem.

The framework defines how quality is:

* specified;
* evaluated;
* measured;
* evidenced;
* automated;
* observed;
* governed;
* improved.

Quality is treated as a continuous engineering capability rather than a final verification activity.

The framework provides common semantics and governance across architecture, source code, testing, documentation, dependencies, build, release, plugins, compliance, and engineering operations.

---

## Problem Statement

FamilyOS uses multiple engineering practices and specialized verification tools.

These capabilities may independently answer questions such as:

* Does the code satisfy static-analysis rules?
* Does type checking succeed?
* Do tests pass?
* Is documentation valid?
* Does a plugin satisfy its compliance requirements?
* Is a build reproducible?
* Is a release candidate ready?

Without a common quality model, these results remain fragmented.

FamilyOS therefore requires an engineering framework capable of transforming specialized verification results into coherent, explainable, evidence-based quality state.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of EPIC-QLT-001 is to establish the common quality layer connecting FamilyOS engineering capabilities.

The framework provides foundations for:

```text

---

## Scope

The Quality Framework covers:

* quality principles;
* quality architecture;
* quality domains;
* quality rules;
* quality profiles;
* quality metrics;
* quality evidence;
* quality risks;
* defects;
* quality debt;
* quality reviews;
* quality assessments;
* quality automation;
* quality observability;
* quality gates;
* quality compliance;
* continuous improvement;
* quality governance;
* framework lifecycle;
* framework validation;
* release readiness;
* implementation planning.

---

## Non-Goals

EPIC-QLT-001 does not replace specialized FamilyOS engineering frameworks.

In particular, the Quality Framework does not own:

* testing architecture owned by the Testing Framework;
* documentation standards owned by the Documentation Framework;
* build architecture owned by the Build Framework;
* release governance owned by the Release Framework;
* plugin compliance rules owned by the Plugin Compliance Framework;
* replacement implementations for Ruff, MyPy, Pytest, or equivalent specialized tools;
* mandatory centralized quality infrastructure;
* AI as an authoritative quality decision mechanism.

The Quality Framework consumes evidence from specialized engineering capabilities and establishes common semantics for interpreting that evidence.

---

## Quality Model

FamilyOS quality is modeled as a relationship between expectations, verification, evidence, findings, assessment, governance, and improvement.

```text
Quality Expectations
        ↓
Quality Rules
        ↓
Quality Profiles
        ↓
Verification
        ↓
Quality Evidence
        ↓
Quality Findings
        ↓
Quality Assessment
        ↓
Quality Gates
        ↓
Governed Decisions
        ↓
Continuous Improvement
```

The framework SHALL preserve traceability across this flow.

A quality decision should be explainable in terms of:

* what expectation applied;
* what rule represented that expectation;
* what verification was executed;
* what evidence was produced;
* what findings resulted;
* what assessment was derived;
* what gate or governance decision followed.

---

## Quality Principles

The Quality Framework is governed by the following principles.

### Quality Is Designed

Quality is an engineering property that must be considered throughout the lifecycle.

It SHALL NOT be treated exclusively as a final verification step.

### Quality Is Evidence-Based

Quality conclusions should be supported by identifiable evidence.

Evidence should be reproducible and traceable where practical.

### Quality Is Explainable

A quality result should communicate why the result exists.

Opaque scores alone are insufficient for authoritative engineering decisions.

### Quality Is Contextual

Different targets may require different quality expectations.

The framework therefore supports profiles and applicability rules rather than assuming one universal threshold.

### Quality Is Progressive

Quality enforcement may increase as an artifact moves toward integration, publication, or release.

### Quality Is Governed

Exceptions, waivers, risk acceptance, and gate decisions require explicit authority and traceability.

### Quality Is Continuous

Quality does not stop after release.

Operational evidence, defects, incidents, trends, and recurring problems should feed continuous improvement.

---

## Quality Architecture

The Quality Framework coordinates specialized engineering evidence without replacing the systems that produce it.

```text
Engineering Standards
        +
Architecture
        +
Source Code
        +
Testing
        +
Documentation
        +
Dependencies
        +
Build
        +
Release
        +
Plugins
        +
Compliance
        ↓
Verification Sources
        ↓
Quality Evidence
        ↓
Quality Findings
        ↓
Quality Assessment
        ↓
Quality Gates
        ↓
Governance
        ↓
Engineering Decisions
```

The architecture separates:

* evidence production;
* evidence normalization;
* quality interpretation;
* quality assessment;
* gate evaluation;
* governance authority.

This separation prevents the Quality Framework from becoming an implementation duplicate of specialized engineering systems.

---

## Quality Domains

Quality expectations are organized into domains.

Representative domains include:

```text
Architecture
Source
Testing
Documentation
Dependencies
Build
Release
Security
Plugins
Compliance
Operations
Maintainability
Reliability
```

Domains provide organizational semantics.

They do not imply that the Quality Framework owns the underlying specialized engineering implementation.

---

## Quality Rules

A Quality Rule represents an explicit quality expectation that can be evaluated.

A rule should define, where applicable:

* identity;
* description;
* domain;
* severity;
* applicability;
* evaluation semantics;
* evidence requirements;
* failure meaning;
* ownership;
* lifecycle state;
* governance requirements.

Rules SHOULD be deterministic where authoritative decisions depend on them.

---

## Quality Profiles

Quality Profiles define reusable collections of expectations appropriate to particular targets or contexts.

Profiles may vary according to:

* repository type;
* artifact type;
* component criticality;
* plugin classification;
* lifecycle stage;
* release channel;
* risk level.

Profiles prevent quality enforcement from becoming an uncontrolled collection of global rules.

---

## Quality Metrics

Metrics provide measurable signals about quality state and evolution.

Metrics may describe:

* verification success;
* failure frequency;
* defect trends;
* quality debt;
* risk exposure;
* evidence freshness;
* gate outcomes;
* exception usage;
* recurring findings;
* remediation latency.

Metrics SHALL support engineering understanding rather than encourage arbitrary optimization.

A metric is not automatically a quality decision.

---

## Quality Evidence

Quality Evidence records the observable result of verification activity.

Evidence should be:

* identifiable;
* reproducible where practical;
* attributable to a target;
* attributable to a repository revision where applicable;
* timestamped where useful;
* associated with the verification mechanism;
* suitable for traceability.

Examples include:

```text
Ruff
MyPy
Pytest
Documentation Validation
Architecture Validation
Plugin Compliance
Build Validation
Manual Review
```

Evidence does not independently define governance authority.

---

## Quality Findings

A Quality Finding represents a relevant observation derived from evidence.

A finding may represent:

* failure;
* warning;
* risk;
* deviation;
* missing evidence;
* policy violation;
* quality debt;
* required review.

Findings should preserve enough context to explain their origin and impact.

---

## Quality Assessments

A Quality Assessment aggregates applicable rules, evidence, findings, and risks into an interpretable quality state.

Assessments should answer questions such as:

* What was evaluated?
* Which expectations applied?
* What passed?
* What failed?
* What evidence supports the result?
* What risks remain?
* What action is required?

Assessments SHALL NOT conceal significant failures behind aggregate scores.

---

## Quality Gates

Quality Gates determine whether a target may progress through an engineering lifecycle transition.

Representative gates include:

* development readiness;
* integration readiness;
* build readiness;
* release readiness;
* plugin readiness.

The framework uses progressive enforcement:

```text
Development
    ↓
Integration
    ↓
Build
    ↓
Release Candidate
    ↓
Release
```

Gate strictness may increase as progression risk increases.

---

## Quality Risk

Quality Risk represents uncertainty that may negatively affect correctness, reliability, maintainability, security, compliance, operability, or sustainability.

Risk management includes:

* identification;
* classification;
* ownership;
* evaluation;
* mitigation;
* acceptance;
* monitoring;
* escalation;
* closure.

Risk acceptance SHALL be explicit and governed.

---

## Defects and Quality Debt

Defects represent known failures or deviations requiring resolution or explicit governance.

Quality debt represents intentionally deferred or accumulated quality work that may increase future engineering cost or risk.

Both should support:

* ownership;
* severity or priority;
* traceability;
* lifecycle state;
* remediation expectations;
* governance.

Quality debt SHALL NOT be used as an unbounded mechanism for bypassing quality requirements.

---

## Quality Reviews and Assessments

Human review remains an important part of quality engineering.

Review may be required for:

* architecture;
* documentation;
* governance;
* security-sensitive changes;
* risk acceptance;
* exceptions;
* complex semantic decisions.

Automated evidence and human review should complement one another.

---

## Quality Automation

Quality automation should be:

* deterministic;
* reproducible;
* observable;
* explainable;
* composable;
* suitable for CI execution.

The Quality Framework may orchestrate specialized tools but SHALL NOT unnecessarily reimplement them.

```text
Quality Orchestration
        ↓
Specialized Validators
        ↓
Normalized Evidence
        ↓
Assessment
        ↓
Gate Decision
```

---

## Quality Observability

Quality state should be observable over time.

Observability may expose:

* current assessments;
* recent failures;
* recurring findings;
* quality trends;
* risk state;
* gate history;
* exception history;
* evidence freshness;
* remediation progress.

Observability supports diagnosis and improvement.

It does not replace governance.

---

## Quality Compliance

Quality Compliance determines whether applicable governed requirements have been satisfied.

Compliance evaluation should preserve traceability between:

```text
Requirement
    ↓
Rule
    ↓
Verification
    ↓
Evidence
    ↓
Finding
    ↓
Compliance Result
```

Compliance results should be explicit and explainable.

---

## Quality Exceptions

Exceptions may be necessary when a requirement cannot reasonably be satisfied immediately.

Exceptions SHALL be governed.

An exception should define:

* affected requirement;
* justification;
* owner;
* approving authority;
* risk;
* compensating controls where applicable;
* expiration or review condition;
* traceability.

Exceptions SHALL NOT silently disable authoritative quality controls.

---

## Continuous Improvement

Quality evidence should feed systemic improvement.

```text
Evidence
   ↓
Findings
   ↓
Patterns
   ↓
Root Causes
   ↓
Improvement
   ↓
Validation
   ↓
Updated Engineering Control
```

Improvement may affect:

* engineering standards;
* architecture;
* tests;
* documentation;
* tooling;
* automation;
* governance;
* quality rules;
* quality profiles.

The goal is not merely to repair individual failures but to reduce recurrence.

---

## Quality Governance

Quality Governance defines authority and responsibility for quality decisions.

Governance should establish:

* ownership;
* decision authority;
* escalation;
* exception approval;
* risk acceptance;
* policy evolution;
* rule lifecycle;
* profile lifecycle;
* gate governance;
* auditability.

Quality authority SHALL remain explicit.

---

## Framework Lifecycle

The Quality Framework itself has a governed lifecycle.

```text
Definition
   ↓
Validation
   ↓
Adoption
   ↓
Operation
   ↓
Evolution
   ↓
Migration
   ↓
Deprecation
   ↓
Retirement
```

Framework evolution should preserve compatibility where reasonably possible.

Breaking semantic changes require explicit migration and governance.

---

## Framework Relationships

EPIC-QLT-001 operates within the broader FamilyOS engineering framework ecosystem.

It depends directly on:

* `EPIC-ENG-001` — Engineering Foundation;
* `EPIC-DOC-001` — Documentation Framework;
* `EPIC-TST-001` — Testing Framework.

It integrates with:

* `EPIC-BLD-001` — Build Framework;
* `EPIC-REL-001` — Release Framework;
* `EPIC-PLUGIN-002` — Plugin Compliance Framework.

These relationships establish explicit ownership boundaries.

---

## Framework Boundaries

The Quality Framework coordinates but does not absorb specialized engineering frameworks.

Testing architecture remains owned by the Testing Framework.

Documentation architecture remains owned by the Documentation Framework.

Build execution remains owned by the Build Framework.

Plugin compliance remains owned by the Plugin Compliance Framework.

Release authority remains owned by the Release Framework.

The Quality Framework provides common quality semantics across these capabilities.

---

## Canonical Documentation

EPIC-QLT-001 contains exactly **26 numbered documents**:

```text
00-EPIC.md
01-Context.md
02-Vision.md
03-Quality-Principles.md
04-Quality-Architecture.md
05-Quality-Domains.md

+
7 control documents
=
33 canonical files
```

The authoritative structural inventory is maintained in `MANIFEST.md`.

---

The EPIC also maintains the canonical control artifacts required for framework governance and traceability.

---

## Success Criteria

The Quality Framework is structurally complete when:

* exactly 26 numbered documents exist;
* the canonical sequence is `00` through `25`;
* every numbered document has a unique number;
* no required canonical document is empty;
* filenames correspond to their canonical responsibilities;
* all seven control documents exist;
* `EPIC.yaml` represents the canonical structure;
* `MANIFEST.md` matches the repository inventory.

The framework is validation-complete when:

* terminology is internally consistent;
* cross-document relationships are coherent;
* framework boundaries are respected;
* references are valid;
* governance responsibilities are consistent;
* YAML metadata parses successfully;
* applicable engineering validation succeeds.

The framework is release-ready only when the requirements defined by:

* `22-Validation.md`;
* `24-Release.md`;
* `VALIDATION.md`;

have been satisfied.

---

## Dependencies

EPIC-QLT-001 depends directly on:

* `EPIC-ENG-001` — Engineering Foundation;
* `EPIC-DOC-001` — Documentation Framework;
* `EPIC-TST-001` — Testing Framework.

The framework integrates with:

* `EPIC-BLD-001` — Build Framework;
* `EPIC-REL-001` — Release Framework;
* `EPIC-PLUGIN-002` — Plugin Compliance Framework.

The Quality Framework coordinates quality across these engineering capabilities without replacing their specialized responsibilities.

---

## Implementation Strategy

The Quality Framework should be implemented progressively.

The expected progression is:

```text
Normative Framework
        ↓
Core Quality Models
        ↓
Quality Evidence
        ↓
Deterministic Tool Adapters
        ↓

        ↓
Continuous Improvement
        ↓
Governance Automation
        ↓
Quality Intelligence
```

The detailed implementation sequence is defined in:

`25-Implementation-Checklist.md`

---

## Validation Baseline

The canonical framework structure contains:

```text
Numbered documents: 26
Control documents:   7
Canonical files:     33
Numbering:           00 → 25
Duplicate numbers:   none
Empty required files: none
```

Historical publication evidence is associated with the immutable release:

```text
v4.6.0-quality-framework
```

The historical tag resolves to the repository state that completed EPIC-QLT-001 version `1.0.0`.

A post-publication revalidation is being performed against the current repository state.

Only evidence produced by actual execution SHALL be recorded as current validation evidence.

Detailed historical and current validation evidence is maintained in `VALIDATION.md`.

---

## Future Evolution

The Quality Framework is designed for progressive evolution.

Future capabilities may include:

* executable Quality Framework domain models;
* machine-readable Quality Rules;
* Quality Profile resolution;
* standardized evidence schemas;
* tool adapters;
* Quality Assessment services;
* CLI quality commands;
* CI quality orchestration;
* architecture validation;
* automated Quality Gates;
* Quality Risk services;
* defect tracking;
* quality debt tracking;
* compliance services;
* governed exception services;
* historical quality metrics;
* Quality Observability services;
* governance automation;
* cross-repository quality analysis;
* automated regression analysis;
* advanced quality intelligence.

Future capabilities must preserve the framework's deterministic, explainable, evidence-based, and governed foundations.

---

## AI Boundary

Future AI-assisted capabilities may support:

* quality explanation;
* assessment summarization;
* investigation;
* recurring-pattern detection;
* historical analysis;
* recommendation;
* quality intelligence.

AI does not replace deterministic verification or governed engineering authority.

AI-generated analysis must not silently become authoritative for:

* compliance;
* Quality Gates;
* exceptions;
* risk acceptance;
* release decisions.

Deterministic evidence and explicit governance remain authoritative.

---

## Risks

The Quality Framework must actively avoid several failure modes.

### Metric Gaming

Risk:

Engineering behavior optimizes visible metrics rather than actual quality.

Mitigation:

Metrics SHALL remain contextual and SHALL NOT independently define quality.

### Excessive Centralization

Risk:

The Quality Framework absorbs responsibilities owned by specialized frameworks.

Mitigation:

Framework boundaries SHALL remain explicit.

### Opaque Quality Scores

Risk:

Aggregate scores hide significant failures or risk.

Mitigation:

Authoritative decisions SHALL remain traceable to evidence and findings.

### Permanent Exceptions

Risk:

Temporary exceptions become uncontrolled long-term bypasses.

Mitigation:

Require ownership, approval, expiration, and traceability.

### Premature Intelligence

Risk:

AI-generated interpretation becomes authoritative before deterministic foundations exist.

Mitigation:

AI SHALL remain advisory unless future governance explicitly establishes a safe and auditable authority model.

---

## Completion Criteria

EPIC-QLT-001 is structurally complete when:

* exactly 26 numbered documents exist;
* the sequence is `00 → 25`;
* each number occurs exactly once;
* no required canonical document is empty;
* all seven control documents exist;
* `EPIC.yaml` and `MANIFEST.md` match the repository structure.

EPIC-QLT-001 is validation-complete when:

* terminology is consistent;
* cross-document semantics are coherent;
* framework boundaries are explicit;
* references are valid;
* governance responsibilities are consistent;
* YAML metadata parses successfully;
* applicable repository quality gates pass;
* actual validation evidence is recorded.

EPIC-QLT-001 is release-ready when the requirements defined by `22-Validation.md`, `24-Release.md`, and `VALIDATION.md` are satisfied.

Version `1.0.0` historically satisfied the applicable publication requirements and was published under the immutable historical tag `v4.6.0-quality-framework`.

---

## Decision Model

Quality decisions should be explainable through a consistent sequence of questions:

```text
What target is being evaluated?

What expectations apply?

What verification was performed?

What evidence was produced?

What findings occurred?

What risks remain?

What is the resulting quality state?

May the target progress?

Who owns the decision?

What should improve next?
```

---

## Current State

```text
EPIC:               EPIC-QLT-001
Framework:          Quality Framework
Version:            1.0.0
Status:             Completed
Owner:              FamilyOS Engineering

Numbered Documents: 26
Control Documents:  7
Canonical Files:    33

Structural State:   Complete
Historical State:   Published
Historical Tag:     v4.6.0-quality-framework
Revalidation State: Validated
```

---

## Validation

The canonical `00 → 25` document structure has been established and structurally validated.

Version `1.0.0` was historically validated and published under:

```text
v4.6.0-quality-framework
```

The historical tag is immutable and represents the repository state associated with the original Quality Framework publication.

A post-publication revalidation is currently being performed to synchronize the control-document layer and record validation evidence against the current repository state.

Current validation results SHALL be recorded only when supported by actual execution evidence.

The authoritative validation record is:

`VALIDATION.md`

---

## Release

Version `1.0.0` is **Completed** and historically **Published**.

Historical publication:

```text
v4.6.0-quality-framework
```

The historical tag SHALL remain immutable.

The current post-publication documentation normalization does not move, rewrite, replace, or repurpose the historical tag.

Any future Quality Framework release SHALL follow the applicable validation, governance, versioning, and release-readiness requirements.

---

## Expected Outcome

EPIC-QLT-001 establishes the foundation for a FamilyOS engineering environment where quality evolves from isolated checks into a coherent system:

```text
Standards
   +
Testing
   +
Documentation
   +
Architecture
   +
Build
   +
Compliance
        ↓
Quality Evidence
        ↓
Quality Assessment
        ↓
Quality Governance
        ↓
Engineering Confidence
        ↓
Continuous Improvement
```

The framework provides the normative foundation required to make FamilyOS quality measurable, explainable, automatable, governable, and sustainable throughout the platform lifecycle.

---

## Final Statement

EPIC-QLT-001 — Quality Framework version `1.0.0` establishes the canonical FamilyOS quality engineering foundation.

Its canonical documentation structure consists of:

```text
26 numbered documents
7 control documents
33 canonical files
```

The framework is completed and historically published under:

```text
v4.6.0-quality-framework
```

The historical publication remains immutable.

Post-publication revalidation may update current validation evidence and synchronize control documentation without altering the identity or historical integrity of the published Quality Framework baseline.
