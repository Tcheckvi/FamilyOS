# Quality Framework

## 12 Quality Reviews and Assessments

### Overview

The FamilyOS Quality Reviews and Assessments model defines how engineering artifacts, components, plugins, changes, releases, processes, and quality states are systematically examined to determine whether they satisfy applicable quality expectations.

Quality reviews and assessments combine:

* automated evidence;
* quality findings;
* quality metrics;
* risk information;
* quality profiles;
* human engineering judgment;
* governance requirements.

They transform isolated verification results into structured conclusions about engineering quality.

The model establishes the relationship:

```text
Quality Requirements
      ↓
Quality Rules
      ↓
Quality Evidence
      ↓
Quality Findings
      ↓
Quality Assessment
      ↓
Engineering Decision
```

Reviews and assessments provide the interpretation layer between raw quality information and authoritative engineering decisions.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of Quality Reviews and Assessments is to establish a consistent method for determining the quality state of FamilyOS engineering artifacts.

Without structured assessment, teams may collect large amounts of verification data without reaching a clear conclusion.

For example:

```text
Tests PASS
Static Analysis PASS
Architecture WARNING
Security PASS
Documentation WARNING
Two Accepted Risks
```

does not automatically answer:

```text
Is this component ready?
```

The assessment model provides the mechanism for answering that question.

---

## Foundational Principle

The foundational principle is:

> Quality assessment must combine evidence, context, risk, and applicable quality expectations into an explainable engineering conclusion.

Assessment must not depend solely on:

* one metric;
* one tool;
* one reviewer;
* one test suite;
* one quality score.

Quality is multidimensional.

Assessment must preserve that multidimensional nature.

---

## Review Definition

A Quality Review is a structured examination of an engineering artifact, change, or quality condition.

A review may be:

* automated;
* manual;
* hybrid.

Reviews typically focus on a defined scope and produce findings, evidence, recommendations, or approvals.

---

## Assessment Definition

A Quality Assessment is the structured evaluation of available quality information against defined expectations.

Conceptually:

```text
Assessment
      =
Applicable Requirements
      +
Evidence
      +
Findings
      +
Metrics
      +
Risk
      +
Context
```

The result is a Quality State.

---

## Review vs Assessment

Reviews and assessments are related but distinct.

```text
Review
      ↓
Examines something
      ↓
Produces evidence and findings

Assessment
      ↓
Consumes evidence and findings
      ↓
Determines quality state
```

A review may participate in an assessment.

An assessment may consume several reviews.

---

## Assessment Identity

Significant assessments should have stable identifiers.

A conceptual format may be:

```text
QLT-ASSESS-<TYPE>-<NUMBER>
```

Examples:

```text
QLT-ASSESS-PLUGIN-001
QLT-ASSESS-REL-004
QLT-ASSESS-ARC-012
```

Stable identities support traceability and auditability.

---

## Review Identity

Formal reviews may similarly use identifiers such as:

```text
QLT-REVIEW-<DOMAIN>-<NUMBER>
```

Examples:

```text
QLT-REVIEW-ARC-001
QLT-REVIEW-SEC-003
QLT-REVIEW-DOC-007
```

Informal development reviews do not necessarily require persistent identifiers.

---

## Assessment Metadata

A Quality Assessment record may include:

```text
id
type
target
scope
profile
revision
status
quality_state
started_at
completed_at
assessor
evidence
findings
risks
metrics
exceptions
decision
comments
```

The exact implementation may evolve.

---

## Review Metadata

A formal review may record:

```text
id
review_type
target
scope
reviewer
criteria
revision
started_at
completed_at
result
findings
evidence
recommendations
```

This creates a durable review history.

---

## Assessment Target

An assessment must identify its target.

Targets may include:

```text
File
Module
Package
Plugin
Capability
Repository
Architecture
Build
Release
Quality Framework
Engineering Process
```

Assessment conclusions are only valid for their defined target.

---

## Assessment Scope

Scope defines which aspects of the target were evaluated.

Example:

```text
Target:
Communication Plugin

Scope:
Architecture and plugin compliance
```

This assessment must not be interpreted as a complete security assessment.

---

## Assessment Revision

Assessments should identify the evaluated revision where practical.

Examples include:

```text
Git Commit
Build Identifier
Release Candidate
Artifact Digest
```

An assessment against one revision does not automatically remain authoritative after significant changes.

---

## Assessment Profile

Quality assessments should resolve the applicable Quality Profile.

Conceptually:

```text
Target
      ↓
Profile Resolution
      ↓
Applicable Rules
      ↓
Required Evidence
```

The profile determines what must be evaluated.

---

## Assessment Types

FamilyOS may support several assessment types:

```text
Component Assessment
Plugin Assessment
Architecture Assessment
Security Assessment
Documentation Assessment
Build Assessment
Release Assessment
Compliance Assessment
Process Assessment
Quality Framework Assessment
```

Each type may use different criteria and evidence.

---

## Component Assessment

A Component Assessment evaluates a defined engineering component.

It may consider:

* correctness;
* testing;
* architecture;
* maintainability;
* dependencies;
* documentation.

The exact requirements depend on the component profile.

---

## Plugin Assessment

A Plugin Assessment evaluates whether a plugin satisfies applicable FamilyOS expectations.

Potential areas include:

```text
Plugin Structure
Capability Contracts
Architecture Boundaries
Documentation
Tests
Compliance Rules
Security
Dependencies
```

Official plugins may require stronger assessment than experimental plugins.

---

## Architecture Assessment

Architecture Assessment examines structural quality.

It may evaluate:

* dependency direction;
* boundaries;
* coupling;
* layering;
* domain separation;
* extension mechanisms;
* architecture decisions.

Architecture assessment often combines automated validation and human review.

---

## Security Assessment

Security Assessment examines applicable security quality requirements.

It may consume:

* vulnerability evidence;
* security tests;
* dependency analysis;
* architecture review;
* configuration checks.

Security-specific policy remains defined by the FamilyOS Security Framework where applicable.

---

## Documentation Assessment

Documentation Assessment evaluates:

* completeness;
* correctness;
* consistency;
* structure;
* traceability;
* versioning;
* normative alignment.

The Documentation Framework defines documentation-specific standards.

---

## Build Assessment

Build Assessment evaluates whether build artifacts and processes satisfy quality requirements.

Potential evidence includes:

* successful build;
* reproducibility;
* dependency resolution;
* artifact integrity;
* packaging validation.

---

## Release Assessment

Release Assessment evaluates whether a release candidate is ready for progression.

It may consume:

```text
Testing Evidence
Security Evidence
Build Evidence
Documentation Evidence
Compatibility Evidence
Open Findings
Quality Debt
Risk
Exceptions
```

Release Assessment is a primary input to release Quality Gates.

---

## Compliance Assessment

Compliance Assessment evaluates whether a target satisfies an applicable compliance profile.

For FamilyOS plugins, this may integrate with the Plugin Compliance Framework.

The Quality Framework consumes compliance results without duplicating domain-specific compliance logic.

---

## Process Assessment

Process Assessment examines whether engineering processes are functioning effectively.

Examples include:

* defect management;
* release workflow;
* documentation lifecycle;
* quality review practices.

Process assessments are primarily used for continuous improvement.

---

## Quality Framework Assessment

The Quality Framework itself must be assessable.

Potential areas include:

```text
Rule Effectiveness
Evidence Reliability
Gate Reliability
Finding Quality
Metric Usefulness
Automation Coverage
Governance Effectiveness
```

Quality infrastructure must not be exempt from quality evaluation.

---

## Review Types

Quality reviews may include:

```text
Peer Review
Architecture Review
Security Review
Documentation Review
Risk Review
Release Review
Quality Review
Post-Incident Review
Framework Review
```

---

## Peer Review

Peer review examines engineering changes before integration.

It may evaluate:

* correctness;
* readability;
* maintainability;
* architecture alignment;
* testing;
* documentation.

Peer review remains an important human quality control even with extensive automation.

---

## Architecture Review

Architecture review is appropriate when changes materially affect:

* system boundaries;
* public contracts;
* domain responsibilities;
* plugin architecture;
* shared infrastructure;
* persistence architecture.

Not every implementation change requires formal architecture review.

---

## Security Review

Security review should be proportional to security risk.

Potential triggers include:

* authentication changes;
* authorization changes;
* sensitive data handling;
* cryptographic changes;
* external exposure;
* security-sensitive dependencies.

---

## Documentation Review

Documentation review evaluates whether important documentation remains aligned with implementation and architecture.

Normative documents generally require stronger review than informal guidance.

---

## Risk Review

Risk review evaluates significant Quality Risks.

It may verify:

* likelihood;
* impact;
* mitigation;
* ownership;
* residual risk;
* acceptance.

High and Critical risks may require formal review.

---

## Release Review

Release review examines the complete release quality state.

It should answer:

```text
Are mandatory requirements satisfied?

Is required evidence available?

Are blocking findings resolved?

Are significant risks understood?

Are exceptions valid?

Is residual risk acceptable?
```

---

## Post-Incident Review

Post-incident review analyzes operational failures.

The objective is to determine:

* what happened;
* why it happened;
* why controls failed;
* what must improve.

The output may include:

* defects;
* risks;
* new rules;
* new tests;
* architecture improvements;
* process changes.

---

## Automated Review

Automated review uses deterministic checks to evaluate quality conditions.

Examples include:

```text
Static Analysis
Type Checking
Architecture Validation
Test Execution
Documentation Validation
Compliance Validation
```

Automated reviews provide consistency and scalability.

---

## Manual Review

Manual review applies engineering judgment where automation is insufficient.

Examples include:

* architecture reasoning;
* design quality;
* risk acceptance;
* ambiguous documentation;
* strategic maintainability.

Manual review must remain structured enough to be traceable.

---

## Hybrid Review

Most significant FamilyOS assessments will likely use hybrid review.

Conceptually:

```text
Automated Evidence
      +
Human Review
      ↓
Quality Assessment
```

Automation provides repeatability.

Human judgment provides context.

---

## Review Criteria

Every formal review should have defined criteria.

Criteria may originate from:

* Quality Requirements;
* Quality Rules;
* architecture principles;
* documentation standards;
* security policy;
* compliance profiles;
* release requirements.

Undefined review criteria produce inconsistent conclusions.

---

## Review Checklist

Checklists may help reviewers apply criteria consistently.

Example:

```text
Architecture Review

[ ] Boundaries respected
[ ] Dependency direction valid
[ ] Public contracts identified
[ ] Extension model appropriate
[ ] Migration impact evaluated
[ ] Relevant ADRs updated
```

Checklists support review but must not replace engineering judgment.

---

## Review Evidence

Formal review outcomes should produce evidence.

Example:

```text
review_type:
Architecture Review

result:
APPROVED

reviewer:
Architecture Authority

target:
Plugin Runtime

revision:
abc123
```

Review evidence participates in broader assessments.

---

## Review Findings

Reviews may produce findings.

Example:

```text
Architecture Review
      ↓
Finding:
Plugin implementation leaks into core domain.
```

Findings then follow the Quality Finding lifecycle.

---

## Review Recommendation

A review may produce recommendations that are not formal findings.

Examples include:

* future simplification;
* optional refactoring;
* documentation improvements.

Recommendations must not be confused with mandatory remediation.

---

## Review Decision

A formal review may conclude:

```text
APPROVED
APPROVED_WITH_CONDITIONS
CHANGES_REQUIRED
REJECTED
```

The exact decision model may vary by review type.

---

## Conditional Approval

`APPROVED_WITH_CONDITIONS` should identify explicit conditions.

Example:

```text
Approved provided that:

- compatibility tests are added;
- migration documentation is completed;
- the temporary exception expires before v5.
```

Conditions must remain trackable.

---

## Review Independence

Some high-risk reviews may benefit from reviewer independence.

For example, the engineer implementing a critical security control should not always be the only person approving its quality.

The required level of independence should be proportional to risk.

---

## Reviewer Qualification

Formal reviews should be performed by people with appropriate expertise.

Examples:

```text
Architecture Review
      → architecture competence

Security Review
      → security competence

Documentation Review
      → documentation standards knowledge
```

Governance may define formal reviewer roles later.

---

## Review Accountability

A review record should identify who made the decision.

Anonymous approval is inappropriate for significant governance decisions.

---

## Review Freshness

Review validity may depend on subsequent changes.

Example:

```text
Architecture Review
      ↓
Approved Revision A
      ↓
Major Architecture Change
      ↓
Review No Longer Authoritative
```

Material changes should trigger reassessment.

---

## Review Triggers

Formal review may be triggered by:

* risk level;
* change scope;
* public API change;
* architecture change;
* security-sensitive change;
* release milestone;
* repeated defect pattern;
* governance requirement.

Review triggers should be explicit where possible.

---

## Change-Based Review

Not every change requires the same review depth.

Conceptually:

```text
Low-Risk Change
      ↓
Peer Review

High-Risk Change
      ↓
Peer Review
+
Architecture / Security / Quality Review
```

This keeps review proportional.

---

## Periodic Review

Some quality areas require periodic review independent of individual changes.

Examples include:

* dependency health;
* quality rules;
* architecture debt;
* quality metrics;
* risk register;
* quality framework effectiveness.

Periodic review prevents long-lived degradation.

---

## Event-Driven Review

Certain events may trigger review.

Examples include:

```text
Major Incident
Critical Vulnerability
Failed Release
Architecture Regression
Repeated Defect
```

These events may reveal systemic quality weaknesses.

---

## Assessment Inputs

A Quality Assessment may consume:

```text
Requirements
Rules
Evidence
Findings
Metrics
Risks
Defects
Quality Debt
Exceptions
Review Results
Historical Trends
```

The applicable Quality Profile determines which inputs are required.

---

## Required Assessment Inputs

An assessment should distinguish between:

```text
REQUIRED
OPTIONAL
INFORMATIONAL
```

Missing required inputs may make the assessment incomplete.

---

## Assessment Completeness

Assessment completeness indicates whether all mandatory evaluation areas have sufficient evidence.

Example:

```text
Testing Evidence          Available
Security Evidence         Available
Architecture Evidence     Missing
Documentation Evidence    Available
```

The assessment should report:

```text
INCOMPLETE
```

rather than incorrectly returning PASS.

---

## Assessment Status

Assessment execution status may include:

```text
PENDING
RUNNING
COMPLETE
INCOMPLETE
ERROR
CANCELLED
```

This is distinct from Quality State.

---

## Quality State

The assessment should produce a normalized Quality State.

A baseline model may include:

```text
PASS
PASS_WITH_WARNINGS
CONDITIONAL
FAIL
UNKNOWN
```

---

## PASS

`PASS` means all required quality expectations are satisfied and no blocking condition exists.

---

## PASS_WITH_WARNINGS

`PASS_WITH_WARNINGS` means mandatory requirements are satisfied but non-blocking concerns remain.

Warnings must remain visible.

---

## CONDITIONAL

`CONDITIONAL` means progression may be allowed only under explicit conditions.

Examples include:

* approved exception;
* required follow-up;
* accepted residual risk.

---

## FAIL

`FAIL` means one or more blocking quality requirements are not satisfied.

---

## UNKNOWN

`UNKNOWN` means available information is insufficient to determine the quality state.

Unknown must never be silently treated as PASS.

---

## Assessment Result vs Gate Decision

Assessment and Quality Gate are distinct.

```text
Assessment
      ↓
Determines quality state

Quality Gate
      ↓
Determines whether progression is allowed
```

For example:

```text
Assessment:
PASS_WITH_WARNINGS

Gate Policy:
Warnings allowed

Gate:
PASS
```

---

## Domain Assessment

Quality may be assessed independently by domain.

Example:

```text
Correctness      PASS
Architecture     PASS
Security         PASS
Documentation    WARNING
Compatibility    PASS
```

This preserves multidimensional visibility.

---

## Aggregate Assessment

Domain assessments may be combined into an aggregate quality state.

Aggregation must preserve blocking conditions.

Conceptually:

```text
Any required domain FAIL
      ↓
Overall FAIL
```

However, exact semantics should be defined by Quality Profile and Gate policy.

---

## No Blind Averaging

Quality must not be reduced through blind averaging.

Example:

```text
Security = 0
Documentation = 100
Average = 50
```

This number is meaningless for release safety.

Critical domain failures must remain explicit.

---

## Assessment Rules

Assessment logic should be deterministic where possible.

Example:

```text
IF
    all mandatory evidence exists
AND
    no blocking findings exist
AND
    no unacceptable risks exist
THEN
    assessment may PASS
```

Human judgment may still be required for contextual areas.

---

## Assessment Policy

Quality Profiles may define assessment policy.

Example:

```text
Official Plugin Profile

Requires:
- testing assessment;
- architecture assessment;
- documentation assessment;
- plugin compliance assessment.
```

This creates predictable evaluation.

---

## Risk-Based Assessment

Risk affects assessment depth.

Example:

```text
Standard Change
      ↓
Automated Assessment

Critical Change
      ↓
Automated Assessment
+
Formal Human Review
+
Explicit Risk Assessment
```

---

## Evidence-Based Assessment

Assessment conclusions must reference supporting evidence.

A conclusion such as:

```text
Testing: PASS
```

should trace to specific test evidence.

This enables drill-down and auditability.

---

## Finding-Based Assessment

Open findings influence assessment according to:

* severity;
* profile;
* target criticality;
* risk;
* exception status.

A finding should not automatically fail every assessment.

Policy determines its effect.

---

## Risk-Based Assessment Decision

Risk may alter assessment conclusions even when individual checks pass.

Example:

```text
All Automated Checks PASS

But:
Unresolved High Operational Risk

Assessment:
CONDITIONAL
```

Quality assessment is broader than tool execution.

---

## Exception-Aware Assessment

Valid exceptions may modify how failed rules are interpreted.

Conceptually:

```text
Rule FAIL
      ↓
Valid Exception?
      ├── No → Blocking
      └── Yes → Accepted Deviation
```

The assessment must still expose the deviation.

---

## Expired Exception

An expired exception must not continue to suppress a failure.

The assessment should treat the original requirement as active again.

---

## Quality Debt in Assessments

Quality debt should be visible in assessments.

Debt may influence:

* warnings;
* risk;
* conditions;
* release readiness.

Not all debt must block progression.

---

## Defects in Assessments

Open defects should be evaluated according to:

* severity;
* risk;
* target;
* lifecycle state;
* release impact.

Critical unresolved defects will normally block relevant assessments.

---

## Historical Assessment

Historical data may help interpret current quality.

Example:

```text
Architecture Assessment

Release N-2: PASS
Release N-1: PASS_WITH_WARNINGS
Release N:   FAIL
```

This trend may indicate architecture degradation.

---

## Baseline Assessment

Legacy areas may be assessed against an explicit baseline.

Conceptually:

```text
Existing Known Violations
      ↓
Baseline

Current Assessment
      ↓
No New Violations
```

Baseline assessment should encourage progressive improvement.

---

## Delta Assessment

A Delta Assessment evaluates changes relative to a previous known state.

Example:

```text
Previous Findings: 25
Current Findings: 20
New Findings: 0
Resolved Findings: 5
```

Delta assessment is useful for large legacy migrations.

---

## Full Assessment

A Full Assessment evaluates the complete applicable quality profile.

It should be required periodically and before significant milestones where appropriate.

---

## Incremental Assessment

Incremental assessment evaluates only affected scope where safely possible.

Benefits include:

* faster feedback;
* reduced CI cost;
* improved developer experience.

Incremental assessment must preserve confidence through reliable impact analysis.

---

## Assessment Cache

Validated assessment results may potentially be reused for unchanged targets.

Cache keys may include:

```text
Target Fingerprint
Profile Version
Rule Versions
Evidence Configuration
```

Reuse must be deterministic and auditable.

---

## Assessment Invalidation

Cached assessment must be invalidated when relevant inputs change.

Triggers may include:

* source change;
* dependency change;
* profile change;
* rule change;
* evidence change;
* configuration change.

---

## Assessment Confidence

The framework may eventually expose assessment confidence.

Confidence may depend on:

* evidence completeness;
* evidence quality;
* review depth;
* uncertainty;
* target complexity.

This should only be introduced if it improves engineering decisions.

---

## Assessment Uncertainty

Assessment must represent uncertainty explicitly.

Examples include:

```text
Missing Security Evidence

Unknown Dependency State

Unverified Migration Behavior
```

Unknown conditions should trigger additional verification where risk warrants it.

---

## Assessment Explanation

Every assessment should be explainable.

An engineer should be able to ask:

```text
Why did this assessment fail?
```

and receive:

```text
Release Assessment FAIL
      ↓
Security Domain FAIL
      ↓
QLT-RULE-SEC-004
      ↓
Critical Finding
      ↓
QLT-EVID-882A11
```

---

## Assessment Summary

A human-readable assessment summary may contain:

```text
Target:
Communication Plugin

Profile:
Official Plugin

Quality State:
PASS_WITH_WARNINGS

Domains:
Correctness      PASS
Architecture     PASS
Testing          PASS
Documentation    WARNING
Security         PASS

Blocking Findings:
0

Warnings:
2

Open Risks:
1 MEDIUM
```

---

## Assessment Details

Detailed assessment should expose:

* evaluated rules;
* evidence;
* findings;
* exceptions;
* risks;
* metrics;
* reviews.

The summary should not replace the underlying data.

---

## Assessment Report

A formal assessment report may include:

```text
Assessment Identity
Target
Revision
Profile
Scope
Quality State
Domain Results
Evidence Summary
Finding Summary
Risk Summary
Exceptions
Recommendations
Decision
```

---

## Review Report

A review report may include:

```text
Review Identity
Review Type
Target
Revision
Reviewer
Criteria
Observations
Findings
Recommendations
Decision
```

---

## Review Comments

Review comments should distinguish between:

```text
BLOCKING
REQUIRED
RECOMMENDED
INFORMATIONAL
```

This prevents ambiguity during remediation.

---

## Review Resolution

Review findings should have explicit resolution.

Example:

```text
Comment:
Public contract lacks versioning strategy.

Resolution:
Versioning strategy added to specification.

Status:
RESOLVED
```

---

## Review Rejection

A review may reject a change when the proposed direction is fundamentally incompatible with required quality expectations.

Rejection should include clear reasoning and remediation direction where possible.

---

## Review Reassessment

After significant changes, a previous review may require reassessment.

The original review should remain preserved historically.

---

## Assessment Reassessment

Assessments may also be repeated after:

* remediation;
* new evidence;
* risk changes;
* exception approval;
* target changes.

Each authoritative assessment should preserve its own identity and timestamp.

---

## Continuous Assessment

As automation increases, quality assessment may become continuous.

Conceptually:

```text
Change
  ↓
Checks
  ↓
Evidence
  ↓
Assessment
  ↓
Updated Quality State
```

This enables rapid engineering feedback.

---

## Continuous Assessment Boundary

Not all quality areas can or should be continuously automated.

Human architecture or risk review may remain milestone-based.

The framework should combine continuous automation with deliberate review.

---

## Pull Request Assessment

A future CI integration may produce a Pull Request Quality Assessment.

Example:

```text
PR Assessment

Correctness      PASS
Static Analysis  PASS
Architecture     PASS
Testing          PASS
Documentation    WARNING

Decision:
Merge Allowed
```

This provides developers with consolidated quality feedback.

---

## Branch Assessment

Protected branches may require stronger assessment than local development branches.

Example:

```text
Feature Branch
      ↓
Fast Assessment

Main Branch
      ↓
Full Required Assessment
```

The exact workflow belongs to Quality Gates and CI policy.

---

## Release Candidate Assessment

Release candidates should receive comprehensive assessment.

Potential inputs include:

```text
Full Test Suite
Build Verification
Security Analysis
Compatibility Validation
Documentation Validation
Open Defects
Risk Register
Quality Debt
Exceptions
```

---

## Post-Release Assessment

A release may also be assessed after deployment using operational evidence.

This can evaluate:

* incident rate;
* reliability;
* regression;
* performance;
* unexpected failures.

Post-release assessment feeds continuous improvement.

---

## Assessment and Metrics

Metrics support assessments but do not replace them.

For example:

```text
Coverage = 95%
```

does not prove correctness.

Metrics provide context.

Evidence and requirements determine quality conclusions.

---

## Assessment and Quality Score

A future Quality Score may summarize selected dimensions.

However:

> A score must never override explicit blocking conditions.

Example:

```text
Quality Score:
94 / 100

Critical Security Finding:
1

Assessment:
FAIL
```

---

## Assessment and Risk

Risk is a first-class assessment input.

Two technically identical findings may produce different assessment outcomes depending on context and target criticality.

---

## Assessment and Quality Debt

Quality debt may be acceptable within defined boundaries.

Assessment should report:

```text
Debt Count
High-Risk Debt
New Debt
Debt Trend
```

New high-risk debt may affect progression more strongly than stable low-risk legacy debt.

---

## Assessment and Compliance

Compliance assessment may contribute a domain result.

Example:

```text
Plugin Compliance:
PASS
```

The Quality Framework should consume the result and evidence rather than duplicate compliance rules.

---

## Assessment and Governance

Governance determines:

* required assessments;
* assessment authority;
* approval requirements;
* review triggers;
* escalation;
* retention.

Assessment behavior must remain consistent across teams and components.

---

## Assessment Authority

Certain assessment decisions may require designated authority.

Examples include:

```text
Architecture Assessment
      → Architecture Authority

Security Assessment
      → Security Authority

Release Assessment
      → Release Governance
```

Automated systems may provide authoritative results for deterministic rules.

---

## Assessment Override

Manual override of an assessment should be exceptional.

If supported, override must include:

```text
Original State
Override State
Reason
Authority
Timestamp
Associated Risk Acceptance
```

Silent overrides are prohibited.

---

## Review Conflict

Reviewers may disagree.

Conflicts should be resolved through:

* evidence;
* applicable requirements;
* architecture principles;
* domain authority;
* escalation.

The framework should avoid decisions based solely on hierarchy where technical evidence can resolve disagreement.

---

## Evidence Conflict

Conflicting evidence should remain visible during assessment.

Example:

```text
Integration Test:
PASS

Production Observation:
FAIL
```

The assessment must evaluate scope and freshness rather than arbitrarily choosing one.

---

## Assessment Error

An assessment may fail operationally because of:

* invalid evidence;
* missing configuration;
* tool failure;
* schema incompatibility.

This should produce:

```text
Assessment Status:
ERROR
```

not a Quality State of PASS or FAIL.

---

## Assessment Integrity

Assessment records may influence release decisions and must therefore be protected from silent modification.

Important fields include:

* quality state;
* findings;
* exceptions;
* risk;
* decision.

---

## Assessment Immutability

Published formal assessments should be treated as immutable where practical.

New information should produce a new assessment or superseding record.

Example:

```text
Assessment A
      ↓
Superseded by
      ↓
Assessment B
```

---

## Assessment Provenance

An authoritative assessment should identify:

```text
Who or what performed it?

Which evidence was used?

Which profile applied?

Which rule versions applied?

Which revision was evaluated?
```

---

## Assessment Retention

Historical assessments may be retained for:

* release reconstruction;
* quality trends;
* audit;
* framework improvement;
* incident investigation.

Retention requirements may vary by assessment type.

---

## Review Retention

Formal reviews with significant governance value should remain traceable.

Routine peer review history may rely on repository collaboration systems.

---

## Assessment Metrics

The assessment system itself may be measured.

Possible metrics include:

```text
Assessment Completion Rate
Assessment Failure Rate
Incomplete Assessment Count
Average Assessment Duration
Reassessment Rate
Assessment Error Rate
```

---

## Review Metrics

Possible review metrics include:

```text
Review Findings
Review Rework Rate
Repeated Review Findings
Review Turnaround
Finding Recurrence
```

Metrics should improve review quality rather than pressure reviewers toward superficial speed.

---

## Review Effectiveness

Review effectiveness may be evaluated by comparing:

```text
Problems Found During Review
      vs
Problems Escaping Review
```

This can identify review areas requiring improvement.

---

## Assessment Effectiveness

Assessment effectiveness may be evaluated by asking whether PASS decisions correlate with stable engineering outcomes.

For example:

```text
Release Assessment PASS
      ↓
Repeated Severe Production Failures
```

may indicate insufficient assessment criteria.

---

## False Confidence Analysis

One of the most important Quality Framework responsibilities is detecting false confidence.

False confidence may arise from:

* incomplete evidence;
* weak tests;
* incorrect rules;
* ignored warnings;
* unreliable assessment logic.

Incidents should therefore evaluate whether previous assessments incorrectly represented quality.

---

## Assessment Calibration

Assessment policy should evolve through engineering experience.

Calibration may consider:

* escaped defects;
* unnecessary gate failures;
* false positives;
* review findings;
* incident history.

Assessment must remain strict enough to protect quality and practical enough to support engineering flow.

---

## Review Calibration

Review criteria should also evolve.

Repeated irrelevant review comments may indicate excessive criteria.

Repeated escaped architecture problems may indicate insufficient criteria.

---

## Quality Review Culture

Reviews should be treated as engineering collaboration rather than personal judgment.

The object of review is:

```text
Artifact
Architecture
Change
Risk
Quality State
```

not the worth of the engineer who created it.

---

## Review Constructiveness

High-quality review comments should be:

* specific;
* evidence-based;
* actionable;
* proportional;
* respectful.

Comments should explain the engineering concern rather than merely state preference.

---

## Review Consistency

Similar situations should receive similar review expectations.

Consistency requires:

* documented criteria;
* common terminology;
* shared profiles;
* reviewer guidance;
* governance.

---

## Review Automation

Automation should eliminate repetitive review work where deterministic rules exist.

Example:

```text
Reviewer repeatedly checks import boundary
      ↓
Architecture Rule
      ↓
Automated Check
```

Human review should focus increasingly on areas requiring judgment.

---

## Assessment Automation

Assessment automation may include:

```text
Evidence Collection
Rule Evaluation
Finding Aggregation
Risk Lookup
Exception Validation
Quality State Calculation
Report Generation
```

Automation must preserve explainability.

---

## AI-Assisted Reviews

AI may assist reviewers with:

* summarizing changes;
* identifying potential risks;
* finding related architecture decisions;
* explaining quality rules;
* suggesting review areas.

AI-generated review observations should remain advisory unless validated.

---

## AI-Assisted Assessments

AI may assist with:

* evidence summarization;
* finding clustering;
* risk correlation;
* trend analysis;
* report generation.

AI must not autonomously:

* accept Critical risk;
* suppress blocking findings;
* approve governance exceptions;
* override authoritative assessment policy.

---

## Assessment Querying

A future Quality Platform may support queries such as:

```text
Show the latest assessment for the Security plugin.

Why did release v5 fail assessment?

Which plugins have conditional assessments?

Show assessments containing High risks.

Compare the last three architecture assessments.
```

Structured assessment data enables this capability.

---

## Review Querying

Possible queries include:

```text
Show unresolved architecture review findings.

Show reviews for this capability.

Which review approved this architecture change?

Show repeated review findings.
```

---

## Assessment Dashboard

A future dashboard may display:

```text
Repository Quality State

Correctness       PASS
Architecture      PASS
Testing           PASS
Security          PASS
Documentation     WARNING
Dependencies      PASS

Overall:
PASS_WITH_WARNINGS
```

Dashboards must preserve drill-down to evidence.

---

## Assessment History

Assessment history may provide:

```text
v4.0    PASS
v4.1    PASS
v4.2    PASS_WITH_WARNINGS
v4.3    PASS
```

This enables longitudinal quality analysis.

---

## Assessment Comparison

Assessments may be compared across:

* revisions;
* releases;
* plugins;
* quality profiles.

Comparison can reveal both improvement and regression.

---

## Assessment Diff

A future assessment diff may show:

```text
New Findings:       2
Resolved Findings:  5
New Risks:           0
Resolved Risks:      1
Changed Domains:     Documentation
```

This improves review efficiency.

---

## Review Anti-Patterns

The framework rejects several review anti-patterns.

### Approval Without Criteria

Review must be based on explicit engineering expectations.

### Rubber-Stamp Review

Approval without meaningful examination provides false confidence.

### Review by Personal Preference

Review comments should be grounded in standards, architecture, or justified engineering reasoning.

### Endless Review

Review must remain proportional and converge toward a decision.

### Hidden Blocking Comments

Blocking concerns must be clearly identified.

### Review Without Ownership

Formal review decisions must identify responsible authority.

---

## Assessment Anti-Patterns

The framework rejects several assessment anti-patterns.

### Single Metric Assessment

Quality cannot be represented by one metric.

### Missing Evidence Equals PASS

Unknown is not PASS.

### Blind Averaging

Critical failures must not disappear inside aggregate scores.

### Stale Assessment Reuse

Assessments must correspond to relevant target state.

### Silent Override

Assessment changes require traceability.

### Assessment Without Scope

A conclusion without defined scope is ambiguous.

### Assessment Without Evidence

Authoritative conclusions require supporting evidence.

---

## Initial Review Model

An initial FamilyOS formal review model may contain:

```text
id
type
target
revision
reviewer
result
findings
comments
```

This is sufficient to establish traceability.

---

## Initial Assessment Model

An initial assessment may contain:

```text
id
target
profile
revision
status
quality_state
evidence
findings
risks
```

This provides the foundation for Quality Gate integration.

---

## Initial Assessment Flow

A practical initial implementation may follow:

```text
Target
  ↓
Resolve Quality Profile
  ↓
Execute Required Checks
  ↓
Collect Evidence
  ↓
Collect Findings
  ↓
Evaluate Risks
  ↓
Validate Exceptions
  ↓
Calculate Domain States
  ↓
Calculate Quality State
  ↓
Generate Assessment Report
```

---

    ↓

Level 7
Quality Intelligence
```

---

## Relationship With Quality Evidence

Quality Evidence provides the factual basis for assessment.

```text
Quality Evidence
      ↓
Quality Assessment
```

Assessment must preserve links to evidence.

---

## Relationship With Quality Risk

Quality Risk provides contextual consequence information.

```text
Finding
      ↓
Risk
      ↓
Assessment
```

This prevents technically identical findings from being interpreted identically in different contexts.

---

## Relationship With Quality Debt

Quality Debt provides visibility into known unresolved deficiencies.

```text
Quality Debt
      ↓
Assessment
      ↓
Release Readiness
```

Debt should influence assessment according to risk and policy.

---

## Relationship With Quality Gates

Assessment answers:

```text
What is the quality state?
```

Quality Gates answer:

```text
May engineering progression continue?
```

The relationship is:

```text
Evidence
      ↓
Assessment
      ↓
Quality State
      ↓
Gate Policy
      ↓
Progression Decision
```

---

## Relationship With Governance

Governance determines:

* who may approve reviews;
* which assessments are mandatory;
* which risks may be accepted;
* when reassessment is required;
* how overrides are controlled.

Reviews and assessments therefore provide the operational decision layer of Quality Governance.

---

## Reference Review Flow

The complete review flow can be represented as:

```text

            ↓
      Review Trigger
            ↓
      Review Criteria
            ↓

      ↓
Aggregate Quality Assessment
      ↓

```

---

## Strategic Outcome

Quality Reviews and Assessments enable FamilyOS to move from fragmented statements such as:

```text
The tests passed.

The reviewer approved it.

The security scanner found nothing serious.

The documentation mostly looks correct.
```

toward a structured conclusion:

```text
The target has been assessed against its applicable
FamilyOS Quality Profile.

All mandatory evidence is available.

No blocking findings remain.

Residual risks are explicitly documented.

Applicable reviews are complete.

The resulting Quality State is PASS_WITH_WARNINGS.
```

This creates a consistent basis for engineering decisions.

---

## Final Review and Assessment Principle

Quality verification is valuable only when its results can be interpreted into meaningful engineering decisions.

FamilyOS therefore requires a structured relationship between:

```text
Requirements
      ↓
Verification
      ↓
Evidence
      ↓
Review
      ↓
Assessment
      ↓
Quality State
      ↓
Decision
```

Quality Reviews and Assessments must remain evidence-based, risk-aware, explainable, traceable, proportional, reproducible where possible, and governed where human authority is required.

Through this model, FamilyOS establishes the interpretation layer required to transform distributed quality signals into coherent engineering confidence across components, plugins, architectures, builds, releases, and the complete platform lifecycle.
