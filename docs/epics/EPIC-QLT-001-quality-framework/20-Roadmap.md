# Quality Framework

# 20 Roadmap

## Overview

The FamilyOS Quality Framework Roadmap defines the progressive implementation, adoption, automation, integration, governance, and long-term evolution of quality capabilities across the FamilyOS engineering ecosystem.

The roadmap translates the Quality Framework from architectural intent into an executable engineering progression.

The objective is not to implement every possible quality capability immediately.

The objective is to establish quality capabilities in the correct dependency order so that each stage creates a stable foundation for the next.

The strategic progression is:

```text
Quality Foundations
      ↓
Deterministic Verification
      ↓
Quality Evidence
      ↓
Quality Assessment
      ↓
Quality Automation
      ↓
Quality Gates
      ↓
Quality Observability
      ↓
Integrated Governance
      ↓
Continuous Improvement
      ↓
Predictive Quality Intelligence
```

The roadmap therefore prioritizes engineering leverage, deterministic behavior, maintainability, and progressive maturity.

---

# Purpose

The purpose of this roadmap is to define:

* implementation priorities;
* capability dependencies;
* maturity stages;
* adoption strategy;
* automation progression;
* integration points;
* governance milestones;
* long-term quality objectives.

The roadmap should prevent fragmented implementation.

Without coordinated progression, FamilyOS could develop isolated quality mechanisms that do not form a coherent quality system.

The desired model is:

```text
Architecture
      ↓
Capability
      ↓
Integration
      ↓
Automation
      ↓
Evidence
      ↓
Governance
      ↓
Continuous Improvement
```

---

# Roadmap Principles

The Quality Framework roadmap follows several principles.

## Foundation Before Automation

Quality semantics must be understood before they are automated.

## Determinism Before Intelligence

Deterministic quality controls should be implemented before AI-assisted interpretation.

## Evidence Before Governance Decisions

Quality decisions should rely on observable evidence.

## Observation Before Enforcement

New quality controls should generally be observed before becoming blocking.

## Prevention Before Correction

The framework should progressively shift quality investment toward preventing defects.

## Incremental Adoption

Quality capabilities should be introduced progressively rather than through a single large transformation.

## Risk-Based Prioritization

Capabilities addressing high-impact systemic risks should receive priority.

## Integration Over Duplication

Existing FamilyOS frameworks should provide domain-specific capabilities rather than duplicate them inside the Quality Framework.

---

# Strategic Direction

The long-term objective is to establish FamilyOS as an engineering system where quality is continuously:

```text
Defined
Measured
Verified
Observed
Assessed
Governed
Improved
```

Quality should become part of normal engineering execution rather than a separate verification phase.

---

# Roadmap Horizon

The roadmap is organized into progressive implementation phases.

```text
Phase 0 — Framework Foundation
Phase 1 — Quality Model
Phase 2 — Deterministic Verification
Phase 3 — Quality Evidence
Phase 4 — Quality Assessment
Phase 5 — Quality Automation
Phase 6 — Quality Gates
Phase 7 — Quality Observability
Phase 8 — Governance Integration
Phase 9 — Continuous Improvement
Phase 10 — Quality Intelligence
```

These phases represent capability maturity rather than mandatory calendar periods.

Several phases may overlap once their prerequisites are sufficiently stable.

---

# Phase 0 — Framework Foundation

## Objective

Establish the normative Quality Framework documentation and architectural model.

This phase defines the common language required by all future quality capabilities.

---

# Phase 0 Scope

The foundation includes:

```text
Quality Context
Quality Vision
Quality Principles
Quality Architecture
Quality Model
Quality Requirements
Quality Metrics
Quality Evidence
Quality Risk
Quality Debt
Quality Reviews
Quality Automation
Quality Observability
Quality Gates
Quality Compliance
Continuous Improvement
Quality Governance
Framework Lifecycle
```

---

# Phase 0 Deliverables

Primary deliverables include:

```text
00-EPIC.md
01-Context.md
02-Vision.md
03-Quality-Principles.md
04-Quality-Architecture.md
05-Quality-Domains.md

```

The exact numbering should remain synchronized with the canonical EPIC manifest.

---

# Phase 0 Exit Criteria

Phase 0 is complete when:

```text
Quality terminology is defined.

Quality responsibilities are separated clearly.

Relationships with other frameworks are documented.

The quality lifecycle is defined.

Governance principles are established.

Future implementation has an authoritative architectural foundation.
```

---

# Phase 1 — Quality Model

## Objective

Introduce machine-readable representations of the core Quality Framework concepts.

The initial implementation should remain intentionally small.

---

# Phase 1 Core Models

Initial models may include:

```text
QualityFinding
QualitySeverity
QualityStatus
QualityTarget
QualityRequirement
QualityRule
QualityEvidence
QualityAssessment
```

---

# Quality Finding Model

A first `QualityFinding` model may conceptually contain:

```text
id
rule_id
severity
message
target
location
evidence
```

---

# Quality Severity Model

The common severity model should become a reusable FamilyOS type.

Conceptually:

```text
INFO
LOW
MEDIUM
HIGH
CRITICAL
```

Exact semantics should remain governed by the Quality Framework.

---

# Quality Status Model

A common quality status may include:

```text
PASS
WARN
FAIL
ERROR
UNKNOWN
```

This should not be confused with severity.

---

# Quality Target Model

A target identifies what is being evaluated.

Potential target types include:

```text
repository
module
package
plugin
document
build
release
configuration
```

---

# Phase 1 Architecture

The implementation should preserve Clean Architecture boundaries.

Conceptually:

```text
quality/
├── domain/
├── application/
├── infrastructure/
└── presentation/
```

The exact repository location should follow FamilyOS project architecture.

---

# Phase 1 Tests

Initial tests should cover:

```text
Model Construction
Validation
Serialization
Severity Semantics
Status Semantics
Identity Stability
```

---

# Phase 1 Exit Criteria

Phase 1 is complete when core quality concepts have stable, tested, implementation-level representations.

---

# Phase 2 — Deterministic Verification

## Objective

Create deterministic quality checks that transform engineering state into structured findings.

The first checks should target existing FamilyOS engineering rules.

---

# Initial Verification Domains

Priority domains include:

```text
Repository Structure
Documentation
Python Quality
Testing
Plugin Compliance
Architecture
Configuration
```

---

# Existing Tool Integration

The Quality Framework should initially integrate existing tools rather than replace them.

Examples include:

```text
Ruff
MyPy
Pytest
Git
FamilyOS Plugin Compliance
Documentation Validation
```

---

# Verification Adapter Model

Existing tools should be normalized through adapters.

Conceptually:

```text
External Tool
      ↓
Quality Adapter
      ↓
Normalized Result
      ↓
Quality Finding
```

---

# Ruff Adapter

Ruff results may become structured quality findings.

---

# MyPy Adapter

Static typing failures may become typed quality findings.

---

# Pytest Adapter

Test execution results may contribute:

```text
Test Status
Failure Evidence
Coverage Evidence
Performance Evidence
```

where applicable.

---

# Plugin Compliance Adapter

The Plugin Compliance Framework should remain authoritative for plugin-specific rules.

The Quality Framework should consume its results rather than duplicate its logic.

---

# Documentation Adapter

Documentation validation results should integrate with the common quality model.

---

# Phase 2 Exit Criteria

Phase 2 is complete when major deterministic FamilyOS verification mechanisms can produce normalized quality findings.

---

# Phase 3 — Quality Evidence

## Objective

Establish structured evidence supporting quality findings and assessments.

---

# Evidence Sources

Initial evidence sources may include:

```text
Ruff Output
MyPy Output
Pytest Results
Compliance Reports
Documentation Validation
Repository Inspection
Git Revision
```

---

# Evidence Identity

Evidence should bind to:

```text
Target
Target Revision
Verification
Timestamp
Tool Version
```

where practical.

---

# Evidence Storage

Initial evidence may remain:

```text
Local
CI-Generated
Artifact-Based
```

A centralized evidence service is not initially required.

---

# Evidence Format

Structured formats such as JSON should be preferred for machine-readable evidence.

Human-readable reports may be generated from the same data.

---

# Evidence Validation

Evidence validation should detect:

```text
Missing Evidence
Invalid Evidence
Stale Evidence
Wrong Revision
Unsupported Format
```

---

# Phase 3 Exit Criteria

Phase 3 is complete when important quality claims can be traced to structured evidence.

---

# Phase 4 — Quality Assessment

## Objective

Aggregate findings and evidence into target-level quality assessments.

---

# Assessment Engine

A minimal assessment engine should:

```text
Load Target
      ↓
Resolve Applicable Requirements
      ↓
Execute or Load Verification
      ↓
Collect Evidence
      ↓
Generate Findings
      ↓
Aggregate State
      ↓
Produce Assessment
```

---

# Assessment Output

An assessment may contain:

```text
target
revision
profile
framework_version
status
findings
evidence
timestamp
```

---

# Assessment Profiles

Initial profiles may include:

```text
repository
official-plugin
documentation
release
```

Profiles should reuse domain frameworks where appropriate.

---

# Assessment Determinism

Equivalent inputs should produce equivalent assessment outcomes.

This should become a major test requirement.

---

# Phase 4 Exit Criteria

Phase 4 is complete when FamilyOS can produce reproducible target-level quality assessments.

---

# Phase 5 — Quality Automation

## Objective

Integrate quality verification into normal engineering workflows.

---

# Local Automation

Developers should be able to execute quality verification locally.

Conceptually:

```text
familyos quality check
```

---

# CI Automation

Quality checks should execute automatically during relevant CI workflows.

Potential boundaries include:

```text
Pull Request
Merge
Build
Release
```

---

# Automation Priority

The first automated checks should be:

```text
Fast
Deterministic
Reliable
Actionable
```

Slow or noisy checks should not become early blocking controls.

---

# Automation Reliability

Before enforcement, automation should demonstrate:

```text
Stable Execution
Low False Positive Rate
Clear Diagnostics
Predictable Runtime
```

---

# Failure Semantics

Automation should distinguish:

```text
Quality Failure
Tool Failure
Configuration Failure
Infrastructure Failure
```

This prevents infrastructure problems from being misreported as product quality failures.

---

# Phase 5 Exit Criteria

Phase 5 is complete when core quality verification executes automatically and reliably across the engineering lifecycle.

---

# Phase 6 — Quality Gates

## Objective

Convert trusted quality assessments into controlled lifecycle progression decisions.

---

# Initial Gates

Initial gates should focus on high-value boundaries.

Potential gates include:

```text
Pull Request Gate
Merge Gate
Release Gate
Official Plugin Compliance Gate
```

---

# Gate Introduction Strategy

Each significant gate should progress through:

```text
OBSERVE
   ↓
WARN
   ↓
ENFORCE
```

---

# Merge Gate

A merge gate may require:

```text
Ruff PASS
MyPy PASS
Tests PASS
Required Compliance PASS
Critical Findings = 0
```

Exact policy should remain governed.

---

# Release Gate

Release gates may require stronger evidence than merge gates.

Potential requirements include:

```text
Full Test Suite
Build Validation
Release Compliance
Documentation Validation
No Unaccepted Critical Risk
```

---

# Gate Override

Override support should not be implemented without:

```text
Authority
Reason
Risk
Traceability
```

---

# Phase 6 Exit Criteria

Phase 6 is complete when trusted quality state can govern important engineering progression boundaries.

---

# Phase 7 — Quality Observability

## Objective

Make quality state, trends, failures, debt, risk, and governance visible over time.

---

# Initial Observability

Initial observability may be report-based.

Examples include:

```text
Quality Summary
Finding Summary
Compliance Summary
Gate Summary
Debt Summary
Risk Summary
```

---

# Historical Data

Quality results should progressively retain sufficient history to support trend analysis.

---

# Initial Trends

Priority trends include:

```text
Test Reliability
Finding Count
Critical Findings
Quality Debt
Gate Failure Rate
Compliance Rate
CI Duration
```

---

# Quality Dashboard

A future dashboard may expose:

```text
Repository Health
Plugin Health
Documentation Health
Testing Health
Architecture Health
Release Readiness
```

---

# Alerting

Alerting should initially focus only on actionable conditions.

Examples include:

```text
New Critical Finding
Critical Gate Failure
Expired High-Risk Exception
Major Quality Regression
```

---

# Phase 7 Exit Criteria

Phase 7 is complete when quality state can be understood historically rather than only through isolated CI executions.

---

# Phase 8 — Governance Integration

## Objective

Integrate quality policy, ownership, risk, debt, exceptions, and lifecycle authority into the engineering system.

---

# Governance Registry

A future governance registry may represent:

```text
Policies
Requirements
Rules
Profiles
Owners
Gates
Exceptions
Risks
```

---

# Ownership

Critical quality artifacts should have explicit owners.

---

# Exception Management

Exceptions should become structured, searchable, and expiration-aware.

---

# Risk Acceptance

Risk acceptance should become traceable and authority-aware.

---

# Quality Debt Governance

Quality Debt should integrate with planning and prioritization.

---

# Policy as Code

Deterministic policy should increasingly become version-controlled configuration.

---

# Governance Audit

Automated validation should detect:

```text
Missing Owner
Expired Exception
Unknown Requirement
Invalid Gate
Conflicting Policy
```

---

# Phase 8 Exit Criteria

Phase 8 is complete when quality authority and policy are explicit, traceable, and integrated with automation.

---

# Phase 9 — Continuous Improvement

## Objective

Transform accumulated quality evidence into systematic engineering improvement.

---

# Improvement Inputs

Inputs include:

```text
Defects
Incidents
Quality Findings
Metrics
Risks
Debt
Gate Failures
Exceptions
Overrides
Developer Feedback
```

---

# Improvement Backlog

Significant systemic improvements should become explicit engineering work.

---

# Root Cause Analysis

Repeated or high-impact problems should trigger structured root cause analysis.

---

# Defect Prevention

Important defects should result in preventive mechanisms where practical.

Examples include:

```text
Regression Test
Quality Rule
Architecture Constraint
Documentation Improvement
Automation
```

---

# Quality Retrospectives

Periodic quality retrospectives should examine:

```text
What Failed
What Escaped
What Repeated
What Improved
What Should Change
```

---

# Improvement Validation

Improvements should be measured against baselines where practical.

---

# Phase 9 Exit Criteria

Phase 9 is complete when quality evidence systematically changes engineering practices rather than only reporting problems.

---

# Phase 10 — Quality Intelligence

## Objective

Introduce advanced analytical and AI-assisted quality capabilities after deterministic foundations are mature.

---

# Quality Intelligence Scope

Potential capabilities include:

```text
Finding Clustering
Trend Interpretation
Risk Prediction
Root Cause Assistance
Quality Regression Detection
Improvement Recommendations
Historical Correlation
```

---

# AI-Assisted Quality Analysis

AI may assist engineers by analyzing large volumes of quality evidence.

It should initially remain advisory.

---

# AI Finding Explanation

AI may generate explanations such as:

```text
Finding
      ↓
Likely Cause
      ↓
Affected Architecture
      ↓
Suggested Investigation
```

---

# AI Root Cause Assistance

AI may correlate:

```text
Defects
Commits
Test Failures
Architecture Changes
Quality Findings
```

to propose hypotheses.

These hypotheses require verification.

---

# Predictive Quality

Future capabilities may identify deteriorating quality before explicit failure occurs.

Example:

```text
Increasing CI Duration
+
Growing Flakiness
+
Increasing Test Retries
      ↓
Predicted Testing Infrastructure Risk
```

---

# Predictive Risk

Historical evidence may help identify areas likely to accumulate:

```text
Defects
Debt
Compliance Failures
Release Problems
```

---

# AI Governance

AI-assisted quality decisions must remain:

```text
Explainable
Traceable
Evidence-Based
Governed
```

AI must not silently become authoritative.

---

# Phase 10 Exit Criteria

Phase 10 is mature when AI improves engineering understanding without replacing deterministic quality authority.

---

# Cross-Phase Dependency Model

The phases have intentional dependencies.

```text
Quality Model
      ↓
Verification
      ↓
Evidence
      ↓
Assessment
      ↓
Automation
      ↓
Gates
      ↓
Observability
      ↓
Governance
      ↓
Continuous Improvement
      ↓
Quality Intelligence
```

Skipping foundational layers should be avoided.

---

# Parallel Development

Some capabilities may develop in parallel.

For example:

```text
Metrics
   ↘
    Evidence
   ↗
Automation
```

However, semantic dependencies must remain respected.

---

# Immediate Implementation Priorities

The first implementation priorities should focus on high engineering leverage.

Recommended order:

```text
1. Core Quality Domain Models
2. Existing Tool Adapters
3. Structured Quality Findings
4. Quality Evidence
5. Assessment Engine
6. Local Quality CLI
7. CI Integration
8. Quality Profiles
9. Merge / Release Gates
10. Historical Quality Reporting
```

---

# Priority 1 — Core Domain Models

Implement the minimal quality domain vocabulary.

Avoid premature abstraction.

---

# Priority 2 — Tool Adapters

Normalize existing verification rather than recreating Ruff, MyPy, Pytest, or plugin compliance logic.

---

# Priority 3 — Structured Findings

Ensure every integrated verification mechanism can produce a common finding model.

---

# Priority 4 — Evidence

Bind quality findings to reproducible evidence.

---

# Priority 5 — Assessment Engine

Provide target-level quality state.

---

# Priority 6 — Quality CLI

Expose quality capabilities through the FamilyOS CLI.

Potential initial commands:

```text
familyos quality check

familyos quality assess

familyos quality report
```

---

# Priority 7 — CI Integration

Use the same quality application layer locally and in CI.

Avoid separate local and CI semantics.

---

# Priority 8 — Quality Profiles

Introduce target-specific quality policies.

---

# Priority 9 — Quality Gates

Use trusted assessments to govern progression.

---

# Priority 10 — Historical Reporting

Retain enough quality history to support meaningful trend analysis.

---

CI Artifacts
      ↓
Historical Reports
      ↓
Dashboards
```

---

# Evidence Roadmap

```text
Ephemeral Tool Output
      ↓
Structured Evidence
      ↓
CI Evidence Artifacts
      ↓
Historical Evidence
      ↓
Queryable Evidence Store
```

A centralized evidence store should only be introduced when operational need justifies it.

---

# Automation Roadmap

Automation should progress from:

```text
Manual
   ↓
Local Command
   ↓
CI Check
   ↓
Required CI Check
   ↓
Quality Gate
   ↓
Continuous Quality Monitoring
```

---

Documented Rules
      ↓
Explicit Ownership
      ↓
Versioned Policy
      ↓
Policy as Code
      ↓
Governance Registry
      ↓
Automated Governance Validation
```

---

# Observability Roadmap

Observability should progress from:

```text
Current Result
      ↓
Historical Result
      ↓
Trend
      ↓
Correlation
      ↓
Alert
      ↓
Prediction
```

---

# Quality Metrics Roadmap

Metrics should initially remain minimal.

Priority metrics may include:

```text
Test Pass Rate
Test Duration
Flaky Test Rate
Critical Finding Count
Compliance Rate
Gate Failure Rate
Quality Debt Count by Severity
```

Additional metrics should be introduced only when they support decisions.

---

# Quality Debt Roadmap

Quality Debt management should evolve through:

```text
Identification
      ↓
Classification
      ↓
Ownership
      ↓
Risk Prioritization
      ↓
Remediation Planning
      ↓
Trend Analysis
```

---

# Quality Risk Roadmap

Risk management should evolve through:

```text
Manual Risk Records
      ↓
Structured Risk Model
      ↓
Assessment Integration
      ↓
Gate Integration
      ↓
Risk Trends
      ↓
Predictive Risk
```

---

# Quality Gate Roadmap

Gate maturity should progress through:

```text
Manual Review
      ↓
Automated Evidence
      ↓
Automated Assessment
      ↓
Non-Blocking Gate
      ↓
Blocking Gate
      ↓
Risk-Adaptive Gate
```

---

# Compliance Roadmap

Compliance should evolve through:

```text
Manual Requirement Review
      ↓
Structured Requirements
      ↓
Compliance Rules
      ↓
Compliance Profiles
      ↓
Automated Compliance
      ↓
Continuous Compliance
```

---

# Plugin Quality Roadmap

Official plugins provide an important early integration target.

The Quality Framework should progressively consume:

```text
Plugin Metadata Validation
Plugin Architecture Validation
Plugin Compliance
Plugin Tests
Plugin Documentation
Plugin Quality Evidence
```

This creates a practical proving ground for broader quality architecture.

---

# Documentation Quality Roadmap

Documentation quality should progressively integrate:

```text
Structure Validation
Naming Validation
Reference Validation
Metadata Validation
Freshness Validation
Traceability Validation
```

---

# Testing Quality Roadmap

Testing quality should progressively expose:

```text
Pass Rate
Coverage
Flakiness
Duration
Isolation
Regression Protection
```

The Testing Framework remains authoritative for testing semantics.

---

# Architecture Quality Roadmap

Architecture quality may progressively integrate:

```text
Dependency Rules
Layer Boundaries
Plugin Boundaries
Domain Boundaries
Forbidden Imports
Architecture Decisions
```

---

# Build Quality Roadmap

Build quality may progressively expose:

```text
Build Success
Reproducibility
Artifact Integrity
Dependency State
Build Performance
```

---

# Release Quality Roadmap

Release quality should eventually aggregate:

```text
Testing
Documentation
Build
Security
Compliance
Quality Risk
Quality Debt
Release Evidence
```

into release readiness.

---

# Security Quality Integration

Security-specific quality controls should remain aligned with Security Architecture and future security frameworks.

The Quality Framework should consume authoritative security findings rather than duplicate security policy.

---

# Developer Experience Roadmap

Quality engineering must remain usable.

Developer experience improvements should include:

```text
Fast Local Checks
Clear Error Messages
Actionable Findings
Single Quality Entry Point
Consistent Local / CI Behavior
```

---

# Feedback Latency Objective

A strategic objective is to move important feedback earlier.

```text
Production
   ↑
Release
   ↑
Merge
   ↑
Pull Request
   ↑
Local Development
```

The earlier a deterministic defect can be detected reliably, the earlier it should be reported.

---

# Performance Roadmap

Quality automation performance should be continuously optimized.

Potential strategies include:

```text
Incremental Validation
Caching
Parallel Execution
Targeted Checks
Change-Aware Verification
```

Performance optimization must not silently reduce quality coverage.

---

# Reliability Roadmap

Quality tooling should progressively become a trusted engineering dependency.

Reliability objectives include:

```text
Deterministic Results
Low Flakiness
Explicit Failure States
Recoverable Errors
Stable Interfaces
```

---

# Scalability Roadmap

As FamilyOS grows, the Quality Framework should support:

```text
More Plugins
More Domains
More Rules
More Evidence
More Repositories
More Contributors
```

without requiring linear increases in manual governance effort.

---

# Configuration Roadmap

Quality configuration should evolve toward:

```text
Defaults
      ↓
Profiles
      ↓
Scoped Overrides
      ↓
Governed Exceptions
```

Configuration should not permit arbitrary weakening of mandatory quality policy.

---

# Quality Platform

At higher maturity, quality capabilities may form a dedicated internal Quality Platform.

Conceptually:

```text
                    Quality Platform

      ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
      │ Quality Model                           │
      │ Requirement Registry                    │
      │ Rule Engine                             │
      │ Evidence Engine                         │
      │ Assessment Engine                       │
      │ Compliance Engine                       │
      │ Gate Engine                             │
      │ Risk / Debt Management                  │
      │ Observability                           │
      │ Governance                              │
      └─────────────────────────────────────────┘

                         ↓

              FamilyOS Engineering
```

This platform should emerge incrementally rather than be built prematurely.

---

# Quality API

A future internal API may expose:

```text
Assess Target
Query Findings
Query Evidence
Evaluate Gate
Query Compliance
Query Risk
Query Debt
```

The API should share domain semantics with the CLI.

---

# Event Integration

Future quality events may include:

```text
quality.assessment.completed
quality.finding.created
quality.risk.created
quality.debt.created
quality.gate.failed
quality.exception.expired
quality.improvement.completed
```

These may integrate with the FamilyOS Event Architecture.

---

# Notification Integration

Important quality events may eventually integrate with the Notification Architecture.

Examples include:

```text
Critical Quality Regression
Release Gate Failure
Expired Exception
Critical Risk Escalation
```

---

# AI Integration Roadmap

AI integration should follow:

```text
Deterministic Foundation
      ↓
Structured Evidence
      ↓
Historical Data
      ↓
AI Analysis
      ↓
Human Validation
      ↓
Governed Recommendation
```

AI should not be introduced before the evidence model is sufficiently reliable.

---

# Data Requirements for Quality Intelligence

Advanced quality intelligence requires high-quality historical data.

Necessary data may include:

```text
Assessments
Findings
Evidence
Defects
Risks
Debt
Gate Decisions
Exceptions
Changes
Incidents
```

Poor data quality will produce poor analytical results.

---

# Roadmap Governance

The roadmap itself should be governed.

Priorities may change based on:

```text
Engineering Risk
Architecture Evolution
Operational Experience
Project Scale
Security Requirements
Developer Feedback
```

Changes should remain consistent with the Quality Framework vision.

---

# Roadmap Review

The roadmap should be reviewed periodically.

Review questions include:

```text
Which capabilities are complete?

Which capabilities provide value?

Which dependencies changed?

Which quality risks increased?

Which phases should accelerate?

Which planned capabilities are no longer necessary?
```

---

# Roadmap Progress

Progress should be evaluated by capability maturity rather than file count or implementation volume.

Poor progress metric:

```text
Number of quality files created.
```

Better:

```text
Percentage of critical engineering transitions
protected by reliable quality evidence and gates.
```

---

# Capability Status

Roadmap capabilities may use:

```text
PLANNED
DESIGNED
IMPLEMENTING
PILOT
ACTIVE
MATURE
DEPRECATED
```

---

# Implementation Checklist

A high-level implementation sequence is:

```text
[ ] Finalize normative Quality Framework
[ ] Validate cross-framework consistency

# Relationship With Engineering Foundation

The Engineering Foundation defines how FamilyOS engineering operates.

The Quality Framework roadmap progressively adds measurable assurance to those practices.

---

# Relationship With Testing Framework

The Testing Framework provides testing semantics and mechanisms.

The Quality Framework consumes testing evidence and integrates it into broader quality assessment.

---

# Relationship With Documentation Framework

The Documentation Framework provides documentation requirements and validation.

The Quality Framework integrates documentation quality into overall engineering quality.

---

# Relationship With Build Framework

Build verification becomes an important source of quality evidence and release readiness.

---

# Relationship With Release Framework

The Release Framework provides lifecycle boundaries where advanced Quality Gates become particularly important.

---

# Relationship With Plugin Compliance Framework

Plugin Compliance provides one of the earliest mature compliance domains for integration with the Quality Framework.

---

# Relationship With Quality Metrics

The roadmap progressively moves metrics from isolated measurements toward decision-supporting quality intelligence.

---

# Relationship With Quality Evidence

Structured evidence is a prerequisite for reliable assessment, gates, governance, and intelligence.

---

# Relationship With Quality Risk

Risk management becomes progressively integrated with assessment and progression decisions.

---

# Relationship With Quality Debt

Quality Debt evolves from manual tracking toward measurable and governed remediation.

---

# Relationship With Quality Automation

Automation transforms the Quality Framework from documentation into an active engineering capability.

---

# Relationship With Quality Observability

Observability provides the historical information necessary for improvement and prediction.

---

# Relationship With Quality Gates

Quality Gates represent a major maturity transition from reporting quality to governing engineering progression.

---

# Relationship With Quality Compliance

Compliance provides deterministic evaluation of authoritative requirements.

---

# Relationship With Continuous Improvement

Continuous Improvement ensures that roadmap capabilities evolve based on actual engineering outcomes.

---

# Relationship With Quality Governance

Quality Governance determines the authority, ownership, and policy governing roadmap implementation.

---

# Relationship With Quality Framework Lifecycle

The Framework Lifecycle governs how roadmap capabilities move from:

```text
PLANNED
   ↓
PILOT
   ↓
ACTIVE
   ↓
MATURE
   ↓
DEPRECATED
   ↓
RETIRED
```

# Roadmap Anti-Patterns

The FamilyOS Quality Framework rejects several roadmap anti-patterns.

## Big-Bang Quality Platform

Do not attempt to implement the complete quality architecture at once.

## Automation Before Semantics

Do not automate rules that are not clearly understood.

## AI Before Evidence

Do not build quality intelligence on unreliable or unstructured data.

## Gates Before Reliability

Do not make unstable checks blocking.

## Metrics Before Purpose

Do not create metrics without decisions they support.

## Dashboard Before Data

Do not prioritize visual presentation over trustworthy quality state.

## Governance Before Need

Do not create unnecessary bureaucracy before real governance problems exist.

## Duplicate Framework Logic

Do not reimplement Testing, Documentation, Build, Release, Security, or Plugin Compliance semantics inside the Quality Framework.

## Permanent Pilot

Capabilities should eventually mature, change, or retire.

## Roadmap Rigidity

The roadmap should guide implementation without preventing evidence-based reprioritization.

# Strategic Outcome

The Quality Framework Roadmap enables FamilyOS to move from:

```text
Quality is primarily represented by independent
engineering tools and documented expectations.
```

toward:

```text
FamilyOS has a unified quality architecture.

Existing engineering tools produce structured
quality evidence.

Quality Assessments provide reproducible
target-level state.

Quality Gates protect important lifecycle
boundaries.

Quality Observability reveals trends.

Risk, debt, compliance, and exceptions are
explicitly governed.

Engineering outcomes continuously improve
the quality system.

Advanced intelligence helps identify future
quality problems before they become failures.
```

---

# Final Roadmap Principle

The Quality Framework should grow only as fast as FamilyOS can keep its quality semantics reliable, understandable, testable, and governable.

The roadmap therefore follows the progression:

```text
Define
   ↓
Implement
   ↓
Verify
   ↓
Collect Evidence
   ↓
Assess
   ↓
Automate
   ↓
Enforce
   ↓
Observe
   ↓
Govern
   ↓
Improve
   ↓
Predict
```

Through incremental implementation, reuse of existing engineering frameworks, deterministic verification, structured evidence, automated assessment, progressive Quality Gates, observability, governance, Continuous Improvement, and eventually explainable Quality Intelligence, FamilyOS can evolve from a collection of strong engineering practices into a coherent and continuously improving quality engineering platform.

## Phase 2 Runtime Vocabulary Reconciliation

Before implementation of the Core Quality Domain Models, the initial runtime
vocabulary is reconciled as follows:

- `QualitySeverity`: `INFO`, `LOW`, `MEDIUM`, `HIGH`, `CRITICAL`.
- `QualityStatus`: `PASS`, `WARNING`, `FAIL`, `ERROR`, `SKIPPED`, `UNKNOWN`.
- `WARNING` is the canonical status spelling for the runtime Quality model.
- `WARN` remains valid only where an existing framework concept intentionally
  represents a mode, phase, policy, or other concept distinct from
  `QualityStatus`.
- `ERROR`, `FAIL`, `SKIPPED`, and `UNKNOWN` remain semantically distinct.
- Quality identifiers remain compatible with the FamilyOS identifier
  specification and the existing governed `QLT-*` namespaces.

This reconciliation does not advance the roadmap into Quality Evidence,
verification adapters, assessment, profiles, CLI, CI, gates, observability, or
governance. Those capabilities remain sequenced after the Core Domain Models
phase.
