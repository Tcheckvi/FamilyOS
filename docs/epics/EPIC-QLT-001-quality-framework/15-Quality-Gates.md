# Quality Framework

## 15 Quality Gates

### Overview

The FamilyOS Quality Gates model defines the controlled decision points that determine whether an engineering artifact, change, component, plugin, build, release candidate, or other governed target may progress through the FamilyOS engineering lifecycle.

Quality Gates transform quality policy into enforceable progression decisions.

They establish the relationship:

```text
Quality Requirements
      ↓
Quality Rules
      ↓
Verification
      ↓
Quality Evidence
      ↓
Quality Assessment
      ↓
Quality Gate
      ↓
Engineering Progression
```

A Quality Gate does not independently determine whether software is correct.

Instead, it consumes an authoritative quality state and applies explicit progression policy.

The central question answered by a Quality Gate is:

```text
May this target proceed to the next governed lifecycle state?
```

---

## Purpose

The purpose of Quality Gates is to prevent engineering progression when required quality conditions are not satisfied.

Without gates, quality verification may produce useful information without affecting engineering behavior.

For example:

```text
Tests FAILED
Architecture WARNING
Security HIGH Finding
Documentation Incomplete
```

may still be ignored if no progression policy exists.

Quality Gates convert these conditions into enforceable decisions.

The desired model is:

```text
Quality State
      ↓
Gate Policy
      ↓
Decision
      ↓
PASS
FAIL
CONDITIONAL
```

---

## Foundational Principle

The foundational principle is:

> Engineering progression must depend on explicit, evidence-based, risk-aware quality policy rather than informal confidence.

Quality Gates must be:

* deterministic where possible;
* explainable;
* traceable;
* proportional;
* reproducible;
* governed;
* difficult to bypass accidentally.

---

## Gate Definition

A Quality Gate is a policy-controlled decision mechanism applied at a defined engineering lifecycle boundary.

A gate evaluates whether the current quality state satisfies the conditions required for progression.

Conceptually:

```text
Gate
=
Target
+
Lifecycle Boundary
+
Quality Profile
+
Assessment
+
Gate Policy
```

---

## Gate Identity

Formal Quality Gates should have stable identities.

A conceptual format may be:

```text
QLT-GATE-<DOMAIN>-<NUMBER>
```

Examples:

```text
QLT-GATE-MERGE-001
QLT-GATE-BUILD-001
QLT-GATE-REL-001
QLT-GATE-PLUGIN-001
```

Stable identities support:

* traceability;
* automation;
* reporting;
* governance;
* historical analysis.

---

## Gate Metadata

A Quality Gate definition may contain:

```text
id
name
description
boundary
target_types
profile
required_assessments
conditions
failure_behavior
exception_policy
authority
version
```

A gate evaluation may contain:

```text
gate_id
target
revision
assessment
decision
evaluated_at
blocking_conditions
exceptions
authority
evidence
```

---

## Gate Boundary

Every gate exists at a specific lifecycle boundary.

Examples include:

```text
Local Development
      ↓
Commit

Commit
      ↓
Pull Request

Pull Request
      ↓
Merge

Source Revision
      ↓
Build

Build
      ↓
Release Candidate

Release Candidate
      ↓
Release

Release
      ↓
Deployment
```

The gate must clearly identify which transition it controls.

---

## Gate Target

Gate targets may include:

```text
Change
Commit
Pull Request
Branch
Component
Plugin
Build
Artifact
Release Candidate
Release
Documentation Set
Architecture Change
```

Gate policy must be appropriate to the target.

---

## Gate Scope

A gate may evaluate the complete target or a defined quality scope.

Example:

```text
Gate:
Documentation Publication Gate

Scope:
Documentation quality only
```

This gate should not be interpreted as proving complete release quality.

---

## Gate Decision

A baseline decision model may include:

```text
PASS
FAIL
CONDITIONAL
ERROR
NOT_APPLICABLE
```

These states must remain semantically distinct.

---

## PASS

`PASS` means all mandatory progression conditions are satisfied.

The target may proceed through the controlled lifecycle boundary.

---

## FAIL

`FAIL` means one or more blocking conditions are not satisfied.

Progression must stop unless an explicitly governed exception or override mechanism applies.

---

## CONDITIONAL

`CONDITIONAL` means progression is permitted only under explicitly recorded conditions.

Examples include:

* approved temporary exception;
* accepted residual risk;
* mandatory follow-up;
* restricted deployment scope.

Conditional progression must remain traceable.

---

## ERROR

`ERROR` means the gate could not reliably evaluate its policy.

Examples include:

```text
Missing Required Assessment
Invalid Gate Configuration
Evidence Infrastructure Failure
Policy Evaluation Error
```

An `ERROR` must never silently become `PASS`.

---

## NOT_APPLICABLE

`NOT_APPLICABLE` means the gate does not apply to the target or transition.

This state should be derived explicitly rather than assumed.

---

## Gate Status vs Gate Decision

Execution status and gate decision should remain distinct.

For example:

```text
Evaluation Status:
COMPLETE

Decision:
FAIL
```

or:

```text
Evaluation Status:
ERROR

Decision:
Unavailable
```

This distinction prevents infrastructure failures from being confused with quality failures.

---

## Gate Policy

Gate Policy defines the conditions required for progression.

Example:

```text
Merge Gate Policy

Requires:
- required assessment complete;
- no Critical findings;
- no blocking High findings;
- required tests PASS;
- required reviews complete.
```

Gate Policy should be version-controlled.

---

## Policy Separation

Gate implementation must not silently define policy.

Conceptually:

```text
Gate Policy
      ↓
Gate Engine
      ↓
Decision
```

The engine evaluates policy.

It does not invent policy.

---

## Gate Inputs

A gate may consume:

```text
Quality Assessment
Domain Assessments
Quality Findings
Quality Risks
Quality Debt
Quality Exceptions
Review Decisions
Evidence Completeness
Compliance State
```

The applicable policy determines which inputs are authoritative.

---

## Assessment-Driven Gates

Where possible, gates should consume normalized Quality Assessments rather than directly interpret every raw tool result.

The preferred relationship is:

```text
Tools
      ↓
Evidence
      ↓
Assessment
      ↓
Gate
```

rather than:

```text
Tool A ─┐
Tool B ─┼─→ Gate
Tool C ─┘
```

This preserves separation between verification and progression policy.

---

## Gate Preconditions

Before evaluating a gate, required preconditions should be satisfied.

Examples include:

```text
Target Identified
Revision Known
Quality Profile Resolved
Required Assessment Available
Assessment Fresh
Required Evidence Complete
```

Missing preconditions should normally prevent authoritative PASS.

---

## Gate Completeness

A gate must verify that all required inputs are present.

Example:

```text
Testing Assessment       PASS
Architecture Assessment  PASS
Security Assessment      MISSING
```

The release gate must not conclude:

```text
PASS
```

unless policy explicitly states that security assessment is not required.

---

## Unknown Is Not Pass

A central Quality Gate rule is:

> Unknown quality state must never be silently interpreted as successful quality state.

Conceptually:

```text
UNKNOWN
      ≠
PASS
```

This applies to:

* missing evidence;
* missing assessments;
* automation errors;
* stale results;
* unresolved required state.

---

## Gate Freshness

Gate inputs must correspond to the relevant target revision.

Example:

```text
Assessment:
Commit A

Gate Target:
Commit B
```

The assessment may be stale.

The gate should reject or invalidate it according to policy.

---

## Gate Fingerprint

A gate evaluation may use a fingerprint based on:

```text
Target Revision
Quality Profile Version
Gate Policy Version
Assessment Identity
Relevant Exceptions
```

This supports reproducibility.

---

## Gate Reproducibility

Given equivalent authoritative inputs and policy, a deterministic gate should produce the same decision.

Conceptually:

```text
Same Inputs
+
Same Gate Policy
      ↓
Same Decision
```

---

## Gate Explainability

Every non-trivial gate decision must be explainable.

For example:

```text
Release Gate:
FAIL

Reason:
Security domain assessment failed.

Blocking Finding:
QLT-FIND-SEC-018

Rule:
QLT-RULE-SEC-004

Severity:
CRITICAL

Exception:
None
```

A gate should never return only:

```text
FAILED
```

without actionable context.

---

## Gate Traceability

A gate decision should trace through the complete quality chain.

Example:

```text
Gate FAIL
      ↓
Assessment FAIL
      ↓
Security Domain FAIL
      ↓
Finding
      ↓
Rule
      ↓
Evidence
```

This creates auditability.

---

## Gate Types

FamilyOS may support several gate types:

```text
Developer Gate
Commit Gate
Pull Request Gate
Merge Gate
Architecture Gate
Plugin Gate
Build Gate
Compliance Gate
Documentation Gate
Release Candidate Gate
Release Gate
Deployment Gate
Post-Release Gate
```

Not every project or target requires every gate.

---

## Developer Gate

A Developer Gate provides rapid local validation before work progresses.

It may include:

```text
Formatting
Linting
Type Checking
Unit Tests
Basic Repository Validation
```

Developer gates should prioritize fast feedback.

They may be advisory or mandatory depending on workflow.

---

## Commit Gate

A Commit Gate may validate conditions required before accepting a commit into a governed workflow.

Potential checks include:

```text
Source Formatting
Lint
Metadata
Generated Artifacts
Repository Structure
```

Commit gates should remain lightweight.

---

## Pull Request Gate

A Pull Request Gate evaluates whether a change is ready for formal integration review.

Potential requirements include:

```text
Required Automation Complete
Required Tests PASS
No Blocking Findings
Documentation Updated
Required Review Assigned
```

---

## Merge Gate

The Merge Gate controls integration into a protected branch.

A conceptual policy may require:

```text
Quality Assessment:
PASS or allowed PASS_WITH_WARNINGS

Required Reviews:
APPROVED

Blocking Findings:
0

Critical Risks:
0 unaccepted

Required Checks:
PASS
```

---

## Merge Gate Flow

```text
Pull Request
      ↓
Quality Automation
      ↓
Quality Evidence
      ↓
Quality Assessment
      ↓
Human Review
      ↓
Merge Gate
      ↓
PASS ─────────→ Merge
FAIL ─────────→ Remediation
CONDITIONAL ──→ Governed Decision
```

---

## Architecture Gate

An Architecture Gate may apply to significant architectural changes.

Triggers may include:

* new subsystem;
* new public contract;
* dependency direction change;
* core architecture modification;
* persistence architecture change;
* plugin architecture change.

The gate may require formal Architecture Review.

---

## Plugin Gate

A Plugin Gate determines whether a plugin satisfies applicable FamilyOS plugin requirements.

For official plugins, the gate may require:

```text
Plugin Compliance       PASS
Architecture            PASS
Testing                 PASS
Documentation           PASS
Security                PASS where applicable
```

The Plugin Compliance Framework remains authoritative for plugin-specific compliance semantics.

---

## Build Gate

A Build Gate determines whether source may progress into an authoritative build artifact.

Potential requirements include:

```text
Source Assessment PASS
Dependency Resolution Valid
Build Configuration Valid
Required Tests PASS
```

---

## Artifact Gate

An Artifact Gate evaluates a produced artifact.

Potential checks include:

* artifact integrity;
* package contents;
* version metadata;
* installability;
* expected files;
* signature or provenance where applicable.

---

## Compliance Gate

A Compliance Gate requires satisfaction of an applicable compliance profile.

Example:

```text
Official Plugin
      ↓
Plugin Compliance Assessment
      ↓
Compliance Gate
```

Compliance failures may block progression independently of general code quality.

---

## Documentation Gate

Documentation Gates may control:

* publication;
* release;
* normative document acceptance.

Potential requirements include:

```text
Required Documents Present
Metadata Valid
References Valid
No Blocking Documentation Findings
```

---

## Release Candidate Gate

A Release Candidate Gate determines whether a build is sufficiently complete to enter final release validation.

Potential requirements include:

```text
Build Valid
Full Test Suite PASS
Required Compliance PASS
Documentation Complete
No Critical Findings
```

---

## Release Gate

The Release Gate is one of the strongest FamilyOS quality boundaries.

It determines whether a release candidate may become an official release.

A conceptual release gate may consume:

```text
Release Assessment
Testing Evidence
Security Evidence
Architecture State
Compliance State
Documentation State
Build Evidence
Open Defects
Quality Debt
Quality Risks
Exceptions
Required Reviews
```

---

## Release Gate Principle

A release should not be approved merely because:

```text
The build works.
```

Release progression should require sufficient evidence that the complete applicable quality profile is satisfied.

---

## Release Gate Example

```text
FamilyOS Release Gate

Release:
v5.0.0

Assessment:
PASS_WITH_WARNINGS

Critical Findings:
0

High Findings:
0 blocking

Critical Risks:
0

High Risks:
1 accepted

Required Evidence:
COMPLETE

Required Reviews:
COMPLETE

Decision:
PASS
```

---

## Deployment Gate

Where deployment is part of FamilyOS lifecycle governance, a Deployment Gate may verify:

* release identity;
* artifact integrity;
* environment readiness;
* deployment configuration;
* required approvals.

Deployment policy belongs primarily to deployment and release architecture.

---

## Post-Release Gate

Some environments may require post-release validation before a release is considered fully accepted.

Potential conditions include:

```text
Smoke Tests PASS
Critical Runtime Signals Healthy
No Immediate Regression
Deployment Verification Complete
```

This should be proportional to operational needs.

---

## Gate Strength

Not all gates require the same strictness.

A conceptual model may include:

```text
ADVISORY
STANDARD
STRICT
CRITICAL
```

Gate strength affects enforcement and exception requirements.

---

## Advisory Gate

An advisory gate reports quality state without blocking progression.

This may be useful during:

* rule rollout;
* migration;
* experimentation.

Advisory gates must be clearly labeled.

---

## Standard Gate

A Standard Gate blocks defined quality violations but permits governed warnings and exceptions.

This may be appropriate for routine integration.

---

## Strict Gate

A Strict Gate requires stronger evidence and allows fewer deviations.

This may apply to:

* protected branches;
* official plugins;
* release candidates.

---

## Critical Gate

A Critical Gate protects high-risk lifecycle transitions.

Examples may include:

* security-sensitive release;
* production deployment;
* authoritative platform release.

Critical gates should generally fail closed when required quality state is unavailable.

---

## Gate Profiles

Gate requirements may be defined through profiles.

Example:

```text
Fast Merge Gate
Full Merge Gate
Official Plugin Gate
Release Gate
Critical Release Gate
```

Profiles prevent duplicated policy.

---

## Profile Composition

Gate profiles may compose requirements.

Example:

```text
Base Merge Policy
      +
Official Plugin Requirements
      +
Security-Sensitive Requirements
```

This enables scalable governance.

---

## Risk-Based Gates

Gate strictness should be proportional to risk.

Example:

```text
Low-Risk Documentation Change
      ↓
Documentation + Basic Validation

Critical Security Change
      ↓
Full Tests
Security Assessment
Architecture Review
Risk Review
Strict Merge Gate
```

---

## Change-Based Gate Resolution

The applicable gate profile may depend on change classification.

Conceptually:

```text
Change
      ↓
Classification
      ↓
Risk Evaluation
      ↓
Gate Profile
```

---

## Domain Gate Conditions

Gate policy may evaluate individual quality domains.

Example:

```text
Correctness      PASS required
Architecture     PASS required
Security         PASS required
Documentation    PASS or WARNING allowed
```

This preserves multidimensional quality.

---

## Blocking Domain

Some domains may be blocking regardless of aggregate score.

For example:

```text
Security:
FAIL

Overall Numeric Score:
96 / 100
```

The gate must still fail if security is mandatory.

---

## No Blind Aggregation

Quality Gates must not use blind averaging.

Conceptually:

```text
Critical Security Failure
+
Excellent Documentation
      ≠
Acceptable Release
```

Blocking conditions remain explicit.

---

## Severity-Based Gate Policy

Gate behavior may depend on finding severity.

Example:

```text
CRITICAL
      → BLOCK

HIGH
      → BLOCK unless explicitly accepted

MEDIUM
      → policy-dependent

LOW
      → generally non-blocking
```

Exact behavior belongs to the applicable Quality Profile and Gate Policy.

---

## Risk-Based Gate Policy

Risk may influence progression independently of finding severity.

Example:

```text
Finding Severity:
MEDIUM

Operational Risk:
HIGH

Gate:
BLOCK
```

Risk is therefore a first-class gate input where applicable.

---

## Defect-Based Gate Policy

Open defects may affect gates according to:

* severity;
* affected target;
* release impact;
* workaround;
* risk;
* lifecycle stage.

A Critical unresolved release defect should normally block release.

---

## Quality Debt and Gates

Quality Debt does not automatically block progression.

Gate policy should consider:

```text
Debt Risk
Debt Age
Debt Growth
Debt Domain
Target Criticality
```

For example:

```text
Low-Risk Legacy Debt
      → may be allowed

New Critical Architecture Debt
      → may block
```

---

## Debt Budget

A future gate policy may define Quality Debt budgets.

Example:

```text
New High-Risk Debt:
0 allowed

Existing Medium Debt:
allowed within approved baseline
```

Debt budgets should support improvement rather than normalize uncontrolled debt.

---

## Baseline-Aware Gates

Legacy systems may require baseline-aware gates.

Conceptually:

```text
Existing Violations:
Allowed temporarily

New Violations:
Blocked
```

This enables incremental quality improvement.

---

## Baseline Growth

A baseline-aware gate must prevent silent baseline growth.

Example:

```text
Baseline Violations:
42

Current:
43

New Violation:
1

Gate:
FAIL
```

unless explicitly governed otherwise.

---

## Exception-Aware Gates

Quality Gates may recognize valid Quality Exceptions.

Conceptually:

```text
Blocking Condition
      ↓
Matching Valid Exception?
      ├── No → FAIL
      └── Yes → Continue Evaluation
```

The exception does not erase the underlying quality condition.

---

## Exception Validation

Before accepting an exception, the gate should verify:

```text
Exception Exists
Rule Matches
Target Matches
Scope Matches
Authority Valid
Expiration Valid
Conditions Satisfied
```

Invalid exceptions must not alter gate decisions.

---

## Expired Exception

An expired exception is no longer authoritative.

Conceptually:

```text
Exception
      ↓
Expired
      ↓
Blocking Rule Active
      ↓
Gate FAIL
```

---

## Conditional Gate Decision

A gate may return `CONDITIONAL` when progression depends on active conditions.

Example:

```text
Decision:
CONDITIONAL

Condition:
Temporary architecture exception valid until v5.1.

Required Action:
Remove deprecated dependency before expiration.
```

---

## Conditions Must Be Explicit

Conditional progression must record:

* condition;
* owner;
* deadline where applicable;
* associated risk;
* authority.

Invisible conditions are not acceptable governance.

---

## Gate Override

Manual override should be exceptional.

An override should require:

```text
Gate Identity
Original Decision
Override Decision
Reason
Authority
Risk Acceptance
Timestamp
Expiration where applicable
```

---

## Override Principle

An override changes the progression decision.

It does not change the underlying quality truth.

Example:

```text
Assessment:
FAIL

Gate:
FAIL

Emergency Override:
Progression Authorized

Underlying Assessment:
Still FAIL
```

This distinction is essential.

---

## Override Authority

Override authority should be proportional to gate criticality.

A developer should not be able to unilaterally override a Critical Release Gate unless governance explicitly grants that authority.

---

## Override Auditability

Every override must remain visible in:

* gate history;
* release evidence;
* quality reports;
* governance review.

---

## Emergency Gate Process

Exceptional operational circumstances may require emergency progression.

A controlled emergency process should include:

```text
Explicit Authority
Documented Reason
Known Quality State
Risk Assessment
Compensating Controls
Follow-Up Obligation
Retrospective Review
```

Emergency procedures must not become routine bypass mechanisms.

---

## Gate Bypass

Uncontrolled gate bypass is prohibited.

Examples include:

* disabling required CI jobs;
* deleting failed evidence;
* silently changing thresholds;
* removing protected branch rules;
* using stale successful results.

These actions undermine the Quality Framework.

---

## Bypass Detection

Quality Observability should detect bypass indicators where practical.

Examples include:

```text
Required Gate Missing
Required Check Disabled
Policy Changed During Failure
Override Without Authority
```

---

## Gate Configuration

Gate configuration should be:

* version-controlled;
* reviewable;
* validated;
* traceable.

A conceptual configuration may include:

```text
gate:
  id: QLT-GATE-MERGE-001
  profile: standard-merge
  require_assessment: true
  allow_warnings: true
  allow_unknown: false
```

The exact format belongs to implementation design.

---

## Gate Configuration Validation

Invalid gate configuration must fail visibly.

Examples include:

```text
Unknown Rule
Unknown Profile
Invalid Severity
Missing Required Condition
```

Invalid configuration must not disable enforcement silently.

---

## Gate Versioning

Gate policies should be versioned.

A historical decision should identify which policy version produced it.

Example:

```text
Gate:
QLT-GATE-REL-001

Policy Version:
3
```

This supports historical reconstruction.

---

## Policy Evolution

Gate policy will evolve as FamilyOS matures.

Changes may include:

* new required assessments;
* stricter severity handling;
* additional domains;
* changed exception rules.

Policy evolution should follow controlled change management.

---

## Gate Policy Rollout

New gate requirements may use staged rollout:

```text
OBSERVE
      ↓
WARN
      ↓
ENFORCE
```

This allows teams to understand impact before strict enforcement.

---

## Observe Mode

In Observe Mode, the gate calculates what its decision would be without blocking progression.

This supports policy calibration.

---

## Warning Mode

In Warning Mode, failures are visible but temporarily non-blocking.

Warnings should identify future enforcement expectations.

---

## Enforcement Mode

In Enforcement Mode, the gate decision controls progression.

---

## Gate Automation

Quality Gates should be automated wherever their policy is deterministic.

Automation may include:

```text
Input Validation
Assessment Retrieval
Exception Validation
Policy Evaluation
Decision Generation
Evidence Generation
Reporting
```

Human authority remains necessary for some reviews, exceptions, and overrides.

---

## Gate Engine

A future Quality Gate Engine may conceptually provide:

```text
evaluate(gate, target, assessment)
      ↓
GateDecision
```

The engine should remain independent of individual CI platforms.

---

## CI Integration

CI may invoke Quality Gates at relevant workflow boundaries.

Example:

```text
CI Jobs
      ↓
Quality Evidence
      ↓
Assessment
      ↓
Merge Gate
      ↓
Repository Protection
```

CI is an execution environment.

The Quality Framework remains the policy authority.

---

## Repository Protection

Protected branches should use gate decisions where supported.

Examples include requiring:

* successful quality checks;
* required review;
* authoritative merge gate.

Repository settings should reflect Quality Governance.

---

## Local Gate Evaluation

Developers may benefit from evaluating gates locally before remote CI.

Conceptually:

```text
familyos quality gate merge
```

This may predict whether a change satisfies merge policy.

The exact CLI belongs to future implementation.

---

## Gate Prediction

Local evaluation may be predictive rather than authoritative when it lacks:

* remote reviews;
* protected environment evidence;
* official build artifacts.

The distinction should be explicit.

---

## Gate Caching

Gate decisions may be reusable only when all relevant inputs remain unchanged.

Potential cache inputs include:

```text
Target Revision
Assessment
Gate Policy
Exceptions
Required Reviews
```

---

## Gate Invalidation

A previous PASS should be invalidated when relevant state changes.

Examples include:

* source revision changes;
* new blocking finding;
* exception expires;
* required review withdrawn;
* policy changes.

---

## Gate Race Conditions

Concurrent engineering activity may create race conditions.

Example:

```text
Gate PASS
      ↓
Target Changes
      ↓
Merge
```

The gate must ensure the evaluated revision matches the progressed revision.

---

## Time-of-Check vs Time-of-Use

Quality Gates should minimize the gap between:

```text
Quality Evaluation
```

and:

```text
Engineering Progression
```

where target state may change.

Revision binding is essential.

---

## Gate Evidence

Each significant gate evaluation should produce evidence.

A gate evidence record may include:

```text
Gate ID
Target
Revision
Policy Version
Assessment
Decision
Timestamp
Blocking Conditions
Exceptions
Authority
```

---

## Gate History

Gate history supports:

* audits;
* quality trends;
* release reconstruction;
* governance analysis.

Example:

```text
v4.0    PASS
v4.1    PASS
v4.2    CONDITIONAL
v4.3    FAIL
v4.3.1  PASS
```

---

## Gate Metrics

Potential metrics include:

```text
Gate Evaluation Count
Gate Pass Rate
Gate Failure Rate
Conditional Decision Rate
Gate Error Rate
Override Rate
Average Gate Duration
```

Metrics should support improvement rather than encourage artificial pass rates.

---

## Gate Pass Rate

A high gate pass rate is not automatically evidence of high quality.

It may mean:

* changes are high quality;
* validation happens earlier;
* gates are too weak.

Interpretation requires additional signals.

---

## Gate Failure Rate

A high gate failure rate may indicate:

* effective early detection;
* poor developer feedback;
* systemic quality issues;
* excessively strict policy.

Observability should support diagnosis.

---

## Gate Override Rate

A growing override rate is an important governance signal.

It may indicate:

```text
Gate Policy Too Strict
Operational Pressure
Weak Quality Culture
Inadequate Emergency Process
```

Repeated overrides require review.

---

## Gate Error Rate

Gate evaluation errors should be rare.

A high error rate indicates unreliable quality infrastructure.

---

## Gate Latency

Gate decisions should be fast once required inputs are available.

Gate latency should not be dominated by policy evaluation.

Most latency should occur in evidence generation and validation.

---

## Gate Observability

Quality Gates should expose:

```text
Current Decision
Previous Decisions
Failure Reasons
Blocking Conditions
Exceptions
Overrides
Policy Version
Evaluation Duration
```

This integrates with Quality Observability.

---

## Gate Alerts

Important gate events may generate alerts.

Examples include:

```text
Critical Release Gate Failure
Repeated Gate Error
Unauthorized Override Attempt
Gate Policy Invalid
```

Alerting should remain risk-based.

---

## Gate Security

Quality Gates are part of the FamilyOS Quality Control Plane.

Their integrity must therefore be protected.

Threats include:

* unauthorized policy modification;
* forged evidence;
* unauthorized override;
* CI tampering;
* stale result reuse.

---

## Gate Authorization

Only authorized actors should be able to:

```text
Modify Gate Policy
Approve Exceptions
Perform Overrides
Change Protected Gate Configuration
```

Authorization requirements should be proportional to risk.

---

## Gate Integrity

Gate decisions should be bound to:

* target;
* revision;
* policy;
* assessment.

This reduces the risk of applying valid decisions to invalid targets.

---

## Gate Provenance

An authoritative gate decision should answer:

```text
Which gate evaluated this?

Which policy version?

Which assessment?

Which target revision?

Which exceptions?

Which authority?
```

---

## Gate Immutability

Published formal gate decisions should be immutable where practical.

If a decision changes, a new evaluation should supersede the previous record.

Example:

```text
Gate Evaluation A
FAIL
      ↓
Remediation
      ↓
Gate Evaluation B
PASS
```

The original failure remains historical evidence.

---

## Gate Retention

Important gate decisions should be retained according to lifecycle significance.

Release Gate evidence generally requires longer retention than routine local developer gate results.

---

## Gate Audit

Periodic gate audits may verify:

```text
Required Gates Exist
Policies Match Governance
Protected Boundaries Enforce Gates
Overrides Are Authorized
Exceptions Are Valid
Gate Evidence Is Complete
```

---

## Gate Effectiveness

A gate is effective when it prevents unacceptable progression without creating unnecessary friction.

Effectiveness may be evaluated through:

```text
Defects Prevented
Escaped Defects
False Blocking
Override Frequency
Gate Failure Causes
Engineering Feedback
```

---

## False Blocking

A gate may block progression incorrectly because of:

* false-positive rule;
* stale evidence;
* incorrect profile;
* automation error.

False blocking should be tracked and corrected.

---

## False Passing

False passing is more dangerous.

It occurs when a gate permits progression despite an unacceptable quality condition.

Potential causes include:

```text
Missing Required Rule
Stale PASS Evidence
Invalid Exception
Incorrect Gate Policy
Automation False Negative
```

Significant escapes should analyze gate effectiveness.

---

## Gate Calibration

Gate policy should evolve based on evidence.

A calibration loop may be:

```text
Gate Decisions
      ↓
Engineering Outcomes
      ↓
Escapes / False Blocks
      ↓
Policy Analysis
      ↓
Gate Improvement
```

---

## Gate Review

Gate policies should be reviewed periodically.

Review questions include:

```text
Are the right conditions blocking?

Are important risks escaping?

Are developers receiving feedback early enough?

Are exceptions increasing?

Are overrides becoming common?

Are some gates redundant?
```

---

## Gate Simplification

Quality Gates should remain understandable.

A gate with hundreds of undocumented special cases becomes difficult to trust.

Policy should favor:

* composable profiles;
* explicit conditions;
* limited exceptions;
* stable semantics.

---

## Gate Composition

Complex lifecycle boundaries may combine several sub-gates.

Example:

```text
Release Gate
      ↓
Testing Gate
Security Gate
Compliance Gate
Documentation Gate
Build Gate
```

The aggregate decision must preserve blocking semantics.

---

## Sub-Gate Failure

If a mandatory sub-gate fails:

```text
Mandatory Sub-Gate FAIL
      ↓
Aggregate Gate FAIL
```

unless an authorized exception explicitly changes the decision.

---

## Independent Gates

Some gates should remain independent.

For example, a Documentation Publication Gate may not require runtime system testing.

Gate composition should reflect actual lifecycle risk.

---

## Quality Gate Matrix

A conceptual gate matrix may be:

| Lifecycle Boundary         | Typical Gate   | Typical Strength    |
| -------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------- |
| Local change               | Developer Gate | Advisory / Standard |
| Commit                     | Commit Gate    | Standard            |
| Pull request               | PR Gate        | Standard            |
| Protected merge            | Merge Gate     | Strict              |
| Official plugin acceptance | Plugin Gate    | Strict              |
| Build artifact             | Build Gate     | Strict              |
| Release candidate          | RC Gate        | Strict              |
| Official release           | Release Gate   | Critical            |

Exact policy remains configurable.

---

## Gate Ownership

Every formal gate should have an owner.

Ownership includes responsibility for:

* policy;
* maintenance;
* effectiveness;
* documentation;
* escalation;
* evolution.

---

## Gate Authority

Gate ownership and override authority are not necessarily identical.

For example:

```text
Gate Owner:
Quality Engineering

Override Authority:
Release Governance
```

This separation may improve governance.

---

## Gate Documentation

Every formal gate should document:

```text
Purpose
Boundary
Target
Inputs
Policy
Blocking Conditions
Exceptions
Authority
Failure Behavior
```

Engineers should understand gates before encountering failures.

---

## Gate Discoverability

A developer should be able to determine:

```text
Which gates apply?

Why do they apply?

What must pass?

How do I reproduce failures?

Who owns the gate?

How are exceptions handled?
```

---

## Actionable Gate Failure

A good gate failure provides:

```text
Gate:
Merge Gate

Decision:
FAIL

Blocking Condition:
Architecture assessment failed.

Finding:
QLT-FIND-ARCH-009

Rule:
QLT-RULE-ARCH-004

Target:
communication plugin

Suggested Action:
Remove dependency on internal core implementation.
```

---

## Gate Developer Experience

Quality Gates should encourage earlier quality verification.

The desired experience is:

```text
Local Feedback
      ↓
PR Feedback
      ↓
Merge Gate
```

rather than discovering all problems only at the final gate.

---

## Shift-Left Gate Strategy

Where possible, conditions enforced later should also be detectable earlier.

Example:

```text
Release Requirement
      ↓
PR Validation
      ↓
Developer Validation
```

This reduces expensive late remediation.

---

## Gate Duplication

Repeatedly executing identical expensive validation at every gate may be unnecessary.

Evidence reuse is appropriate when:

* evidence remains fresh;
* target is unchanged;
* policy permits reuse.

---

## Gate Defense in Depth

Some critical validations may intentionally repeat at multiple boundaries.

Example:

```text
Security Check at Merge
      +
Security Check at Release
```

This may be justified when risk warrants defense in depth.

---

## Quality Gate Anti-Patterns

The FamilyOS Quality Framework rejects several gate anti-patterns.

### Green CI Equals Release Approval

CI success alone does not necessarily represent complete release quality.

### Gate Without Policy

A gate must have explicit progression conditions.

### Gate Without Evidence

Authoritative progression decisions require authoritative inputs.

### Unknown Equals Pass

Missing information must not become implicit approval.

### Blind Quality Score

High aggregate scores must not hide blocking failures.

### Silent Bypass

Required gates must not be bypassed invisibly.

### Permanent Exception

Exceptions require scope, authority, and lifecycle.

### Untraceable Override

Overrides must remain auditable.

### Stale Gate Result

A PASS from another revision must not authorize current progression.

### Gate Everywhere

Not every lifecycle transition requires the strongest possible gate.

Quality control must remain proportional.

---

## Initial Gate Model

An initial FamilyOS Quality Gate implementation may contain:

```text
id
target
assessment
policy
decision
blocking_conditions
timestamp
```

This is sufficient to establish basic enforcement.

---

## Initial Merge Gate

A practical initial Merge Gate may require:

```text
Ruff:
PASS

MyPy:
PASS

Pytest:
PASS

Required Quality Assessment:
PASS or allowed PASS_WITH_WARNINGS

Blocking Findings:
0
```

As the Quality Framework matures, additional domains can be integrated.

---

## Initial Release Gate

A practical initial Release Gate may require:

```text
Full Tests:
PASS

Static Analysis:
PASS

Build:
PASS

Documentation:
PASS

Required Assessments:
COMPLETE

Critical Findings:
0

Critical Risks:
0 unaccepted
```

---

## Initial Gate Flow

```text
Engineering Target
      ↓
Execute Required Quality Checks
      ↓
Generate Evidence
      ↓
Create Quality Assessment
      ↓
Load Gate Policy
      ↓
Validate Exceptions
      ↓
Evaluate Blocking Conditions
      ↓
Generate Gate Decision
      ↓
Allow or Block Progression
```

---

## Gate Maturity Model

Quality Gates may mature through:

```text
Level 1
Manual Progression Decisions

    ↓

Level 2
Independent Required Checks

    ↓

Level 3
Standardized Gate Policies

    ↓

Level 4
Assessment-Driven Gates

    ↓

Level 5
Risk-Based Gate Profiles

    ↓

Level 6
Automated Governance and Observability

    ↓

Level 7
Adaptive Evidence-Based Quality Control
```

---

## Adaptive Gates

At high maturity, gate profiles may adapt according to:

```text
Target Criticality
Change Type
Risk
Historical Quality
Affected Domains
```

Adaptive behavior must remain policy-driven and explainable.

It must not become opaque probabilistic approval.

---

## AI-Assisted Gate Analysis

AI may assist with:

* explaining gate failures;
* summarizing blocking conditions;
* identifying related historical findings;
* suggesting remediation paths.

AI must not independently override authoritative gate policy.

---

## AI Gate Restrictions

AI must not autonomously:

```text
Approve Quality Exceptions
Accept Critical Risk
Override Release Gates
Suppress Blocking Findings
Change Gate Policy
```

unless future governance explicitly defines a controlled authoritative mechanism.

---

## Relationship With Quality Requirements

Quality Requirements define the conditions FamilyOS expects.

Quality Gates determine whether unmet requirements prevent progression.

---

## Relationship With Quality Evidence

Quality Evidence provides the factual basis for assessment.

Gates should rely on validated evidence through authoritative assessments.

---

## Relationship With Quality Metrics

Metrics may influence gate policy where explicitly defined.

However:

```text
Metric
      ≠
Gate Decision
```

unless policy maps that metric to a progression condition.

---

## Relationship With Quality Risk

Risk is a first-class input to strict gates.

A gate may block progression even when deterministic checks pass if residual risk is unacceptable.

---

## Relationship With Defect and Quality Debt Management

Defects and Quality Debt may influence gate decisions according to severity, risk, age, and target criticality.

Not every open defect or debt item should automatically block progression.

---

## Relationship With Quality Reviews and Assessments

Quality Assessments answer:

```text
What is the current quality state?
```

Quality Gates answer:

```text
May progression continue?
```

The relationship is:

```text
Evidence
      ↓
Assessment
      ↓
Quality State
      ↓
Gate Policy
      ↓
Progression Decision
```

---

## Relationship With Quality Automation

Quality Automation executes deterministic checks and may automatically evaluate gates.

Automation operationalizes Gate Policy.

---

## Relationship With Quality Observability

Quality Observability exposes:

* gate state;
* failures;
* overrides;
* exceptions;
* trends;
* effectiveness.

Gate behavior becomes a major source of quality telemetry.

---

## Relationship With Quality Governance

Quality Governance defines:

```text
Which Gates Exist
Where They Apply
Who Owns Them
Who May Override Them
Which Exceptions Are Valid
How Policies Change
```

Quality Gates are therefore one of the primary enforcement mechanisms of Quality Governance.

---

## Relationship With Testing Framework

Testing produces evidence consumed by assessments and gates.

The Testing Framework determines testing strategy.

Quality Gates determine when testing state blocks lifecycle progression.

---

## Relationship With Documentation Framework

Documentation validation may participate in:

* merge gates;
* publication gates;
* release gates.

Normative documentation may require stricter gate policy.

---

## Relationship With Build Framework

Build Gates ensure that build progression satisfies required quality conditions.

Build evidence may also feed Release Gates.

---

## Relationship With Release Framework

The Release Framework defines release lifecycle transitions.

Quality Gates provide the quality enforcement mechanism at those transitions.

---

## Relationship With Plugin Compliance Framework

Plugin Compliance results may become mandatory inputs to Plugin Gates and Release Gates for official plugins.

---

## Reference Gate Flow

The complete FamilyOS Quality Gate flow can be represented as:

```text

      ↓

└────────────────────────────────┘
      ↓
Engineering Progression Decision
      ↓
Gate Evidence
      ↓
Quality Observability
      ↓
Continuous Improvement
```

---

## Strategic Outcome

Quality Gates enable FamilyOS to move from:

```text
The checks ran.

Someone reviewed the change.

The release looks acceptable.

We can probably continue.
```

toward:

```text
The target has been evaluated against the applicable
FamilyOS Quality Profile.

Required evidence is complete and current.

The authoritative Quality Assessment is available.

Blocking findings, risks, exceptions, and reviews have
been evaluated according to versioned Gate Policy.

The progression decision is explicit, reproducible,
traceable, and governed.
```

This creates controlled engineering progression.

---

## Final Quality Gate Principle

Quality information has limited protective value if unacceptable engineering states can progress without control.

FamilyOS therefore requires explicit lifecycle boundaries where authoritative quality state becomes an enforceable engineering decision.

The Quality Gate model establishes the relationship:

```text
Quality Requirement
      ↓
Verification
      ↓
Evidence
      ↓
Assessment
      ↓
Quality State
      ↓
Gate Policy
      ↓
Progression Decision
```

Through explicit policies, assessment-driven decisions, risk awareness, revision binding, exception validation, controlled overrides, automation, observability, traceability, and governance, Quality Gates provide FamilyOS with the enforcement layer required to ensure that engineering progression occurs only when the applicable level of quality confidence has been established.
