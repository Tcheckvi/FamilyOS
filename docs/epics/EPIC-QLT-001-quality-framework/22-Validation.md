# Quality Framework

## 22 Validation

### Overview

The FamilyOS Quality Framework Validation defines how the Quality Framework itself is verified before it is considered complete, authoritative, releasable, and suitable for integration into the FamilyOS engineering ecosystem.

The Quality Framework defines how FamilyOS evaluates quality.

It must therefore satisfy a higher standard of internal consistency than an ordinary engineering document.

A framework that defines quality while containing contradictions, incomplete requirements, broken references, ambiguous responsibilities, or unverifiable principles would undermine the engineering system it is intended to protect.

The validation model is therefore recursive:

```text
FamilyOS
   ↓
Quality Framework
   ↓
Quality Requirements
   ↓
Quality Verification

but also:

Quality Framework
   ↓
Framework Validation
   ↓
Evidence
   ↓
Framework Quality Decision
```

The Quality Framework must itself be subject to quality assurance.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of Quality Framework Validation is to establish evidence that the framework is:

* structurally complete;
* architecturally coherent;
* internally consistent;
* technically feasible;
* traceable;
* maintainable;
* testable;
* governable;
* compatible with related FamilyOS frameworks;
* ready for implementation and evolution.

Validation should answer:

```text
Is the framework complete?

Is it internally coherent?

Does it conflict with existing architecture?

Are responsibilities clearly separated?

Can the concepts actually be implemented?

Can requirements be verified?

Can the framework evolve safely?

Is sufficient evidence available to declare it ready?
```

---

## Validation Principle

The foundational principle is:

> The Quality Framework must satisfy the quality expectations it establishes for the rest of FamilyOS.

This means the framework should demonstrate:

```text
Explicit Requirements
Clear Architecture
Traceable Decisions
Structured Evidence
Deterministic Validation
Governed Exceptions
Controlled Lifecycle
Continuous Improvement
```

---

## Validation Scope

Validation applies to the complete Quality Framework artifact set.

This includes:

```text
EPIC Definition
Context
Vision
Quality Principles
Quality Architecture
Quality Model
Quality Requirements
Quality Metrics
Quality Evidence
Quality Risk Management
Defect and Quality Debt Management
Quality Reviews and Assessments
Quality Automation
Quality Observability
Quality Gates
Quality Compliance
Continuous Improvement
Quality Governance
Framework Lifecycle
Roadmap
References
Validation
Summary
Release
Implementation Checklist
```

It also includes supporting control artifacts such as:

```text
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

where present in the canonical EPIC structure.

---

## Validation Dimensions

The Quality Framework should be validated across multiple dimensions.

```text
Structural Validation
      ↓
Content Validation
      ↓
Architecture Validation
      ↓
Semantic Validation
      ↓
Cross-Framework Validation
      ↓
Traceability Validation
      ↓
Implementation Feasibility
      ↓
Governance Validation
      ↓
Lifecycle Validation
      ↓
Release Validation
```

No single validation dimension is sufficient.

---

## Structural Validation

Structural validation verifies that the framework contains the expected artifact structure.

Questions include:

```text
Are all required files present?

Are file names canonical?

Are numbering rules respected?

Are duplicate chapters absent?

Are unexpected files absent?

Are control artifacts present?

Are empty normative documents absent?
```

---

## Structural Inventory

A canonical inventory should be maintained.

Conceptually:

```text
docs/epics/EPIC-QLT-001-quality-framework/
├── 00-EPIC.md
├── 01-Context.md
├── 02-Vision.md
├── 03-Quality-Principles.md

├── 24-Implementation-Checklist.md
├── EPIC.yaml
├── README.md
├── MANIFEST.md
├── CHANGELOG.md
├── VALIDATION.md
└── Revision-History.md
```

The actual canonical inventory is authoritative if numbering evolves.

---

## File Presence Validation

Every mandatory file should exist.

A missing normative chapter should fail framework completeness validation.

---

## Empty File Validation

Normative files should not be empty.

Example check:

```text
File Exists
   +
File Size > 0
   +
Expected Structure Present
      ↓
PASS
```

---

## Duplicate File Validation

Duplicate semantic chapters should be detected.

Examples:

```text
02-Vision.md
02-Quality-Vision.md
```

may indicate accidental duplication unless explicitly intentional.

---

## Naming Validation

File names should follow FamilyOS naming conventions.

Validation should detect:

* inconsistent capitalization;
* invalid numbering;
* ambiguous abbreviations;
* unexpected separators;
* naming drift.

---

## Numbering Validation

Numbered chapters should form a coherent sequence.

Gaps should either be intentional and documented or treated as findings.

---

## Control Artifact Validation

Control artifacts should be checked for consistency with normative documents.

Examples include:

```text
EPIC.yaml
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
README.md
Revision-History.md
```

---

## Content Validation

Content validation verifies that each document fulfills its intended responsibility.

The goal is not merely to verify that text exists.

The goal is to verify that the required engineering concepts are actually defined.

---

## Content Completeness

Each chapter should cover its expected subject.

For example:

```text
Quality Metrics
      ↓
must define measurement principles,
metric semantics,
interpretation,
governance,
and misuse prevention.
```

A file containing unrelated content should not pass simply because it is non-empty.

---

## Required Concept Validation

Important concepts should appear in the appropriate normative chapters.

Examples include:

```text
Quality Finding
Quality Evidence
Quality Requirement
Quality Rule
Quality Assessment
Quality Risk
Quality Debt
Quality Gate
Quality Compliance
Quality Governance
```

---

## Responsibility Validation

Each major concept should have a clear responsibility boundary.

The framework should answer:

```text
Who defines it?

Who produces it?

Who consumes it?

Who governs it?

What lifecycle applies?
```

---

## Ambiguity Validation

Normative statements should avoid ambiguous language where deterministic interpretation is required.

Examples of problematic language include:

```text
usually
probably
when appropriate
good quality
reasonable amount
sufficient testing
```

Such terms may be acceptable in guidance but should not define executable compliance without additional semantics.

---

## Normative Language Validation

Where mandatory requirements are expressed, the framework should use consistent normative language.

Potential terminology includes:

```text
MUST
MUST NOT
SHOULD
SHOULD NOT
MAY
```

The Documentation Framework should remain authoritative for exact language standards.

---

## Internal Consistency Validation

The framework should not define contradictory semantics across chapters.

Example contradiction:

```text
Quality Requirements:
CRITICAL findings always block release.

Quality Gates:
CRITICAL findings may be ignored automatically.
```

Such inconsistency should fail validation.

---

## Terminology Consistency

Terms should retain the same meaning throughout the framework.

Examples:

```text
Finding
Evidence
Assessment
Compliance
Gate
Risk
Debt
Exception
Override
```

Terminology drift should be treated as a documentation quality issue.

---

## Status Consistency

Lifecycle states should remain consistent across documents.

If one chapter defines:

```text
ACTIVE
DEPRECATED
RETIRED
```

another chapter should not silently introduce incompatible semantics for the same lifecycle.

---

## Severity Consistency

Severity definitions must remain consistent across:

```text
Findings
Risks
Debt
Compliance
Gates
Reports
```

Different domains may use specialized models, but mappings should be explicit.

---

## Architecture Validation

Architecture validation verifies that the Quality Framework aligns with FamilyOS architecture.

The Quality Framework must not create parallel architectural systems without justification.

---

## Architectural Boundary Validation

The framework should preserve separation between:

```text
Quality Domain
Testing Domain
Documentation Domain
Build Domain
Release Domain
Security Domain
Plugin Compliance Domain
```

---

## Dependency Direction Validation

Future implementation should respect FamilyOS Clean Architecture principles.

Conceptually:

```text
Presentation
      ↓
Application
      ↓
Domain

Infrastructure
      ↓
Ports / Contracts
```

Infrastructure tools should not define domain semantics.

---

## Tool Independence Validation

Quality semantics should remain independent from specific tools.

Incorrect:

```text
Quality PASS means Ruff exited with code 0.
```

Better:

```text
A coding-quality requirement is satisfied when
the authoritative verification produces no
disqualifying findings.

Ruff may be one verification adapter.
```

This preserves architectural flexibility.

---

## Provider Independence

CI providers, storage systems, reporting tools, and dashboards should remain implementation details where practical.

---

## Cross-Framework Validation

The Quality Framework must be validated against related FamilyOS frameworks.

Priority dependencies include:

```text
Engineering Foundation
Testing Framework
Documentation Framework
Build Framework
Release Framework
Plugin Compliance Framework
Architecture Foundation
```

---

## Engineering Foundation Validation

Verify that the Quality Framework remains consistent with:

```text
Engineering Principles
Development Workflow
Coding Standards
Testing Philosophy
Documentation Philosophy
Quality Philosophy
Technical Governance
Engineering Lifecycle
```

---

## Testing Framework Validation

Verify that the Quality Framework does not redefine testing architecture or methodology.

The expected relationship is:

```text
Testing Framework
      ↓
Testing Requirements / Evidence
      ↓
Quality Framework
      ↓
Quality Assessment
```

---

## Documentation Framework Validation

Verify that documentation-specific semantics remain authoritative in the Documentation Framework.

The Quality Framework should integrate results rather than duplicate standards.

---

## Build Framework Validation

Verify that build semantics remain defined by the Build Framework.

Quality should consume build evidence and assess quality impact.

---

## Release Framework Validation

Verify that release lifecycle semantics remain owned by the Release Framework.

The Quality Framework may define quality conditions used by Release Gates.

---

## Plugin Compliance Validation

Verify that plugin-specific compliance remains owned by the Plugin Compliance Framework.

The Quality Framework should consume plugin compliance results.

---

## Architecture Foundation Validation

Verify compatibility with:

```text
Application Architecture
Domain Architecture
Plugin Architecture
Runtime Architecture
Configuration Architecture
Integration Architecture
API Architecture
CLI Architecture
Event Architecture
Observability Architecture
Security Architecture
Governance Architecture
```

---

## Reference Validation

References should be verified for existence and authority.

Validation should identify:

```text
Broken References
Unknown ADRs
Unknown RFCs
Unknown Specifications
Deprecated Framework References
Retired References
```

---

## Reference Existence

A normative reference should resolve to an identifiable FamilyOS artifact.

---

## Reference Status

Where status information exists, validation should determine whether the referenced artifact is:

```text
ACTIVE
DEPRECATED
RETIRED
UNKNOWN
```

---

## Reference Version Validation

Where semantics depend on a particular version, the version should be explicit.

---

## Traceability Validation

Important Quality Framework concepts should be traceable to their authority.

Conceptually:

```text
Architecture Principle
      ↓
Quality Requirement
      ↓
Quality Rule
      ↓
Verification
      ↓
Evidence
      ↓
Assessment
      ↓
Gate
```

---

## Requirement Traceability

Every mandatory Quality Requirement should eventually identify:

```text
Requirement ID
Authority
Applicability
Verification
Evidence
Severity
```

---

## Rule Traceability

Every Quality Rule should identify the requirement or policy it verifies.

A rule without authority risks becoming arbitrary policy.

---

## Evidence Traceability

Evidence should identify:

```text
Target
Revision
Verification
Tool / Mechanism
Timestamp
```

where applicable.

---

## Assessment Traceability

An assessment should identify the evidence and framework state used to produce its result.

---

## Gate Traceability

A gate decision should be traceable to:

```text
Gate Policy
Assessment
Findings
Evidence
Exceptions
Overrides
```

---

## Governance Traceability

Governance decisions should preserve:

```text
Decision
Authority
Reason
Timestamp
Affected Artifact
```

---

## Implementation Feasibility Validation

A framework can be logically coherent but impractical to implement.

Feasibility validation therefore asks whether proposed concepts can realistically be implemented within FamilyOS.

---

## Model Feasibility

Core domain concepts should be representable using stable data models.

Examples:

```text
QualityFinding
QualityEvidence
QualityAssessment
QualityRequirement
QualityRule
QualityGateDecision
```

---

## Verification Feasibility

Requirements intended for automation should have plausible verification mechanisms.

If no deterministic verification exists, the requirement should not pretend to be automatically enforceable.

---

## Evidence Feasibility

Required evidence should be obtainable without unreasonable engineering cost.

---

## Automation Feasibility

Automation proposals should account for:

```text
Execution Time
Reliability
CI Cost
Tool Availability
Developer Experience
Maintenance Cost
```

---

## Gate Feasibility

A gate should not depend on unavailable, unreliable, or excessively slow evidence.

---

## Operational Feasibility

Quality Observability and Governance should not assume infrastructure that FamilyOS does not yet possess.

The roadmap should distinguish:

```text
Current Capability
Future Capability
```

---

## Determinism Validation

Deterministic quality mechanisms should produce stable outcomes.

Conceptually:

```text
Same Target
+
Same Revision
+
Same Framework Version
+
Same Configuration
      ↓
Equivalent Quality Result
```

---

## Repeatability Validation

Important verification should be repeatable across compatible environments.

---

## Environment Sensitivity

Environment-dependent results should be explicitly identified.

Potential sources include:

```text
Python Version
Operating System
Dependency Version
Tool Version
Environment Variables
```

---

## Reproducibility Validation

Where reproducibility is required, all relevant inputs should be identifiable.

---

## Quality Model Validation

The Quality Model should be checked for conceptual completeness.

At minimum, it should clearly distinguish:

```text
Requirement
Rule
Finding
Evidence
Assessment
Metric
Risk
Debt
Gate
Compliance
```

---

## Requirement Model Validation

Requirements should support:

```text
Identity
Authority
Applicability
Verification
Severity
Lifecycle
```

---

## Finding Model Validation

Findings should support:

```text
Identity
Rule
Target
Severity
Message
Evidence
Location
Status
```

as applicable.

---

## Evidence Model Validation

Evidence should support:

```text
Identity
Type
Source
Target
Revision
Timestamp
Validity
```

---

## Assessment Model Validation

Assessments should support:

```text
Target
Framework Version
Profile
Findings
Evidence
Status
Timestamp
```

---

## Metric Model Validation

Metrics should have:

```text
Purpose
Definition
Calculation
Source
Interpretation
Owner
```

---

## Risk Model Validation

Quality Risk should support:

```text
Description
Likelihood
Impact
Exposure
Owner
Mitigation
Status
```

The exact schema may evolve.

---

## Debt Model Validation

Quality Debt should support:

```text
Description
Source
Impact
Priority
Owner
Remediation
Status
```

---

## Gate Model Validation

Quality Gates should support:

```text
Boundary
Policy
Inputs
Decision
Reason
Evidence
Override
```

---

## Compliance Model Validation

Compliance should distinguish:

```text
Requirement
Applicability
Verification
Evidence
Result
```

---

## Governance Validation

Governance validation verifies that the framework defines clear authority.

Questions include:

```text
Who can create mandatory policy?

Who can approve breaking changes?

Who can accept risk?

Who can approve exceptions?

Who can override gates?

Who can retire requirements?
```

---

## Ownership Validation

Critical framework artifacts should have identifiable ownership.

---

## Exception Governance Validation

Exceptions should define:

```text
Scope
Reason
Authority
Risk
Expiration
```

---

## Override Governance Validation

Gate overrides should remain exceptional and traceable.

---

## Risk Acceptance Validation

Accepted risk should identify the accepting authority.

---

## Lifecycle Validation

Every authoritative framework component should have a lifecycle.

Examples include:

```text
Requirements
Rules
Profiles
Metrics
Gates
Automation
Framework Versions
```

---

## Rule Lifecycle Validation

Rules should have valid lifecycle states.

Example:

```text
PROPOSED
EXPERIMENTAL
OBSERVE
WARN
ENFORCE
DEPRECATED
RETIRED
```

The canonical lifecycle should be defined consistently.

---

## Invalid Lifecycle Transition

Automation should eventually detect invalid transitions.

Example:

```text
PROPOSED
   ↓
RETIRED
```

may require explicit governance rather than normal promotion.

---

## Deprecation Validation

Deprecated capabilities should identify:

```text
Replacement
Migration
Timeline
```

where applicable.

---

## Retirement Validation

Before retirement, validation should confirm that active dependencies have been migrated or explicitly accepted.

---

## Roadmap Validation

The roadmap should be checked for architectural feasibility and dependency order.

Incorrect progression:

```text
Predictive AI
      ↓
Evidence Model
```

Correct progression:

```text
Evidence Model
      ↓
Historical Data
      ↓
Quality Intelligence
```

---

## Dependency Validation

Roadmap capabilities should not depend on capabilities scheduled after them without explanation.

---

## Incremental Delivery Validation

Each roadmap phase should provide useful engineering value independently.

---

## Quality Gate Validation

Quality Gates require particularly strong validation because they can block engineering progression.

---

## Gate Correctness

A gate should block only when authoritative policy requires it.

---

## Gate Reliability

Infrastructure failures should not be silently interpreted as quality failures.

---

## Gate Diagnostics

A failed gate should explain:

```text
What Failed
Why It Failed
Which Requirement Applies
What Evidence Exists
What Remediation Is Expected
```

---

## Gate Override Validation

If override exists, the mechanism should be:

```text
Authorized
Explicit
Traceable
Time-Bounded where appropriate
```

---

## Quality Metrics Validation

Metrics should be checked for usefulness and misuse risk.

Questions include:

```text
Does the metric support a decision?

Can it be interpreted consistently?

Can it be gamed?

Does it create harmful incentives?

Is its data reliable?
```

---

## Vanity Metric Detection

Metrics without actionable purpose should be challenged.

Example:

```text
Total Number of Quality Checks
```

may provide little value without context.

---

## Metric Stability

Changes in metric calculation should be versioned or documented.

---

## Quality Evidence Validation

Evidence should be validated for:

```text
Authenticity
Completeness
Relevance
Freshness
Target Binding
Revision Binding
```

as appropriate.

---

## Stale Evidence Validation

Evidence should not be reused beyond its valid context.

---

## Quality Risk Validation

Risk processes should distinguish identified risk from confirmed defects.

Risk scoring should remain understandable and governable.

---

## Quality Debt Validation

Quality Debt should not become a generic label for every unfinished task.

Debt should represent an intentional or accumulated quality compromise with future cost or risk.

---

## Review and Assessment Validation

Quality Reviews should have defined scope and outputs.

Quality Assessments should have reproducible semantics where automated.

---

## Automation Validation

Quality Automation should itself be tested.

Relevant tests include:

```text
Unit Tests
Integration Tests
Regression Tests
Failure Tests
Configuration Tests
Performance Tests
```

---

## Automation Failure Validation

The framework should distinguish:

```text
Verification Failure
      vs
Quality Failure
```

Example:

```text
MyPy cannot execute
```

is not equivalent to:

```text
MyPy reports type errors
```

---

## Observability Validation

Quality Observability should expose useful state without becoming the source of truth for quality policy.

Dashboards visualize state.

They do not define policy.

---

## Compliance Validation

Compliance semantics should be deterministic where possible.

The same applicable requirements and evidence should produce equivalent compliance outcomes.

---

## Continuous Improvement Validation

Continuous Improvement should produce actual engineering changes.

A framework that repeatedly measures problems without changing engineering behavior is incomplete.

---

## Documentation Quality Validation

The Quality Framework documentation itself should be reviewed for:

```text
Clarity
Consistency
Structure
Terminology
References
Duplication
Completeness
Maintainability
```

---

## Markdown Validation

Markdown should follow FamilyOS Documentation Standards.

Potential checks include:

```text
Heading Structure
Code Fence Closure
List Formatting
Table Formatting
Whitespace
Link Validity
```

---

## Heading Validation

Unexpected heading levels or inconsistent document titles should be detected.

---

## Code Fence Validation

Every Markdown code fence should be correctly closed.

---

## Link Validation

Internal links and references should resolve where practical.

---

## Documentation Duplication

Substantial duplication between chapters should be reviewed.

Some repetition is acceptable for clarity, but normative semantics should have a clear authoritative location.

---

## Document Size

Document size alone should not determine quality.

A long document may still be incomplete.

A short document may be sufficient.

Validation should focus on required content and clarity.

---

## Manual Review

Not all framework quality can initially be automated.

Manual review remains important for:

```text
Architectural Coherence
Semantic Clarity
Governance Correctness
Roadmap Feasibility
Cross-Framework Responsibility
```

---

## Peer Review

Before final framework release, the Quality Framework should receive engineering review appropriate to its architectural importance.

---

## Architecture Review

Architecture review should confirm:

```text
No Invalid Layering
No Duplicated Framework Responsibility
No Tool-Driven Domain Model
No Unnecessary Infrastructure Assumption
```

---

## Governance Review

Governance review should confirm authority and lifecycle semantics.

---

## Implementation Review

Implementation-oriented review should verify that the framework can reasonably translate into code and automation.

---

## Validation Evidence

Validation should produce evidence.

Potential evidence includes:

```text
File Inventory
Structural Validation Output
Reference Validation Output
Cross-Framework Review
Markdown Validation
Architecture Review
Implementation Feasibility Review
Git Revision
```

---

## Validation Record

A validation record may conceptually contain:

```text
framework: EPIC-QLT-001
revision: <git-revision>
validation_date: <timestamp>
status: PASS
validators:
  - structural
  - documentation
  - architecture
  - references
findings: []
```

The exact schema may evolve.

---

## Validation Status

A framework validation may use:

```text
PASS
PASS_WITH_FINDINGS
FAIL
INCOMPLETE
```

---

## PASS

All mandatory validation criteria are satisfied.

---

## PASS_WITH_FINDINGS

The framework is acceptable, but non-blocking findings remain.

Such findings should be explicitly recorded.

---

## FAIL

One or more blocking validation requirements are not satisfied.

---

## INCOMPLETE

Required validation has not yet been executed or evidence is insufficient.

---

## Finding Severity

Validation findings may use the Quality Framework severity model.

For example:

```text
INFO
LOW
MEDIUM
HIGH
CRITICAL
```

---

## Blocking Validation Findings

Potential blocking findings include:

```text
Missing Normative Chapter
Contradictory Mandatory Requirements
Broken Critical Authority Reference
Undefined Governance Authority
Invalid Framework Dependency
Incomplete Release Evidence
```

---

## Non-Blocking Findings

Examples may include:

```text
Minor Terminology Improvement
Formatting Issue
Future Automation Opportunity
Non-Critical Reference Improvement
```

---

## Validation Exceptions

Any exception to validation requirements should be explicit.

An exception should identify:

```text
Requirement
Reason
Risk
Authority
Expiration
Remediation
```

---

## Validation Automation

Validation should progressively become automated.

Initial automation may verify:

```text
File Presence
Empty Files
Numbering
Naming
Markdown Structure
Broken Relative Links
Required Metadata
```

---

## Advanced Validation Automation

Later automation may verify:

```text
Requirement IDs
Rule References
Reference Status
Profile Consistency
Lifecycle States
Cross-Framework Dependencies
```

---

## Validation CLI

A future CLI may provide:

```text
familyos quality framework validate
```

Potential output:

```text
FamilyOS Quality Framework Validation

Structure .............. PASS
Documentation .......... PASS
References ............. PASS
Architecture ........... PASS
Governance ............. PASS
Lifecycle .............. PASS

Overall:
PASS
```

---

## Detailed Validation CLI

A verbose mode may expose:

```text
familyos quality framework validate --verbose
```

with evidence and findings.

---

## Machine-Readable Validation

A structured mode may eventually support:

```text
familyos quality framework validate --format json
```

for CI integration.

---

## CI Validation

Framework validation should eventually execute automatically when Quality Framework artifacts change.

Conceptually:

```text
Quality Framework Change
      ↓
CI
      ↓
Structural Validation
      ↓
Documentation Validation
      ↓
Reference Validation
      ↓
Automated Framework Tests
      ↓
Quality Result
```

---

## Change-Aware Validation

Only relevant validation may need to run for small changes, while major framework changes should trigger full validation.

---

## Full Validation Triggers

Full validation should be considered for:

```text
Major Framework Release
Breaking Requirement Change
Quality Model Change
Governance Change
Gate Policy Change
Lifecycle Change
```

---

## Release Validation

Before release, the framework should pass a final release validation.

---

## Release Validation Inputs

Inputs should include:

```text
Normative Documents
Control Artifacts
Validation Evidence
Known Findings
Accepted Risks
Changelog
Version
Implementation Status
```

---

## Release Validation Decision

Conceptually:

```text
Framework Complete?
      ↓
Validation PASS?
      ↓
Blocking Findings = 0?
      ↓
Required Governance Approval?
      ↓
Release Ready
```

---

## Validation and Implementation Status

Documentation completion does not imply implementation completion.

The framework may be:

```text
Documentation: COMPLETE
Implementation: PLANNED
```

This distinction must remain explicit.

---

## Framework Documentation Validation

The current EPIC may therefore reach:

```text
Framework Definition:
COMPLETE

Framework Implementation:
NOT YET COMPLETE
```

without contradiction.

---

## Validation and Versioning

Every released framework version should be associated with validation evidence.

---

## Validation and Git

Validation evidence should identify the Git revision where practical.

This prevents ambiguity about what was actually validated.

---

## Validation and Changelog

Significant validation-related changes should appear in the framework changelog.

---

## Validation and Revision History

Document revisions should remain traceable through FamilyOS revision history conventions.

---

## Validation and Quality Gates

Eventually, framework validation itself may become a Quality Gate.

Example:

```text
EPIC-QLT-001 Change
      ↓
Framework Validation
      ↓
FAIL
      ↓
Merge Blocked
```

This should only occur once validation automation is reliable.

---

## Validation and Continuous Improvement

Validation findings should feed Continuous Improvement.

Example:

```text
Repeated Broken References
      ↓
Root Cause Analysis
      ↓
Reference Validator
      ↓
Prevention
```

---

## Validation and Quality Debt

Known validation weaknesses may become Quality Debt.

Example:

```text
Cross-framework references are currently
validated manually.
```

This may be acceptable initially but should remain visible if it creates material risk.

---

## Validation and Risk

Incomplete validation may create explicit Quality Risk.

Example:

```text
Risk:
Quality Gate semantics have not yet been
tested against real CI workflows.
```

Such risks should not be hidden.

---

## Validation and Governance

Quality Governance determines:

```text
Required Validation
Blocking Findings
Exception Authority
Release Authority
```

Validation produces evidence.

Governance interprets that evidence for authoritative decisions.

---

## Initial Validation Strategy

The initial Quality Framework validation can remain pragmatic.

Recommended sequence:

```text
1. Verify canonical file inventory.
2. Verify no required files are empty.
3. Verify numbering and naming.
4. Verify Markdown structure.
5. Review terminology consistency.
6. Review cross-framework responsibilities.
7. Verify references.
8. Review implementation feasibility.
9. Review roadmap dependency order.
10. Record findings.
11. Resolve blocking findings.
12. Update VALIDATION.md.
```

---

## Initial Shell Validation

Simple repository checks may include:

```text
find docs/epics/EPIC-QLT-001-quality-framework \
  -maxdepth 1 \
  -type f \
  | sort
```

and:

```text
find docs/epics/EPIC-QLT-001-quality-framework \
  -maxdepth 1 \
  -type f \
  -empty
```

These are only structural checks.

They do not prove semantic quality.

---

## File Count Validation

A file count may detect unexpected structural changes.

However:

```text
Expected File Count
      ≠
Framework Quality
```

File count is supporting evidence only.

---

## Git Status Validation

Before release, the working tree should be reviewed.

Example:

```text

Unexpected changes should be investigated.

## Test Validation

Once implementation exists, framework-related tests should pass.

Potential scope includes:

```text
Quality Domain Tests
Quality Application Tests
Quality Adapter Tests
Quality CLI Tests
Quality Integration Tests
Quality Compliance Tests
Quality Gate Tests
```

---

## Static Analysis Validation

Quality implementation should satisfy FamilyOS static quality controls.

Current examples include:

```text
Ruff
MyPy
```

---

## Full Repository Validation

Before significant framework release, the complete repository test suite should be considered where practical.

This reduces cross-framework regression risk.

---

## Validation Maturity Model

Quality Framework Validation may mature through:

```text
Level 1
Manual Documentation Review

      ↓

Level 2
Structural Automation

      ↓

Level 3
Reference Validation

      ↓

Level 4
Semantic Model Validation

      ↓

Level 5
Cross-Framework Validation

      ↓

Level 6
Automated Framework Quality Gate

      ↓

Level 7
Continuous Framework Assurance
```

## Validation Anti-Patterns

The FamilyOS Quality Framework rejects several validation anti-patterns.

### File Presence Equals Validation

A document existing does not prove that its content is correct.

### Tests Equal Complete Validation

Passing tests do not prove architectural or governance coherence.

### Manual Review Only Forever

Repeatable structural validation should eventually be automated.

### Automation Without Semantic Review

Automated checks cannot replace architectural judgment.

### Self-Certification Without Evidence

The framework should not declare itself valid without supporting evidence.

### Validation After Release

Validation should precede authoritative release.

### Hidden Findings

Known problems should be recorded.

### Permanent Exceptions

Validation exceptions should not become silent permanent policy.

### Tool Success Equals Quality Success

A successful tool execution does not automatically imply framework validity.

### Documentation Complete Equals Implementation Complete

These are separate lifecycle states.

## Strategic Outcome

Quality Framework Validation enables FamilyOS to move from:

```text
We have written the Quality Framework,
therefore it is complete.
```

toward:

```text
The Quality Framework has a canonical
structure.

Its concepts are internally consistent.

Its responsibilities align with other
FamilyOS frameworks.

Its references are traceable.

Its architecture is implementable.

Its governance and lifecycle are explicit.

Its known limitations are recorded.

Its validation evidence identifies exactly
what was reviewed.

The framework can therefore be released with
a defensible quality decision.
```

---

## Final Validation Principle

The authority of the Quality Framework depends on the credibility of the framework itself.

FamilyOS therefore requires the Quality Framework to demonstrate the same characteristics it expects from engineering systems:

```text
Clarity
   +
Consistency
   +
Evidence
   +
Traceability
   +
Determinism
   +
Governance
   +
Maintainability
```

Validation is not the final activity performed after the Quality Framework has been created.

Validation is the mechanism that establishes whether the framework is sufficiently complete, coherent, feasible, traceable, and governed to become an authoritative part of FamilyOS engineering.

The Quality Framework is ready only when its quality can itself be demonstrated.
