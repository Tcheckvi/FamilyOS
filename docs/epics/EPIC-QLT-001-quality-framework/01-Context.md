# Quality Framework

## 01 Context

### Context

FamilyOS is evolving from a collection of engineering components into a structured software platform composed of a core architecture, domain capabilities, official plugins, engineering frameworks, specifications, automation mechanisms, and governance rules.

As the platform grows, the ability to implement new functionality is no longer sufficient.

FamilyOS must also be able to demonstrate that its components remain correct, reliable, maintainable, secure, documented, testable, observable, compatible, and architecturally coherent throughout their lifecycle.

This requirement creates the need for an explicit and unified Quality Framework.

The Quality Framework establishes the engineering context in which quality is defined, evaluated, measured, governed, automated, and continuously improved across the FamilyOS ecosystem.

---

## Background

The early stages of FamilyOS development focused primarily on establishing the fundamental architecture of the platform.

This included the definition of:

* architectural boundaries;
* domain structures;
* plugin mechanisms;
* capability models;
* engineering conventions;
* specifications;
* testing practices;
* documentation structures;
* build processes;
* release processes.

As these foundations mature, the engineering challenge changes.

The primary question is no longer only:

```text
Can FamilyOS implement this capability?
```

It also becomes:

```text
Can FamilyOS prove that this capability satisfies the required level of quality?
```

This distinction is fundamental.

A system may function correctly in a limited context while still containing architectural violations, insufficient tests, security weaknesses, documentation gaps, performance regressions, maintainability problems, or hidden technical debt.

The Quality Framework exists to address these broader concerns.

---

## Platform Evolution

FamilyOS is designed as a long-lived and extensible platform.

Its architecture must support continuous evolution across:

```text
Core Platform
      ↓
Domain Capabilities
      ↓
Official Plugins
      ↓
Integrations
      ↓
Automation
      ↓
Applications
      ↓
Future Extensions
```

Each additional component increases the number of interactions, dependencies, contracts, and possible failure modes within the ecosystem.

Without systematic quality management, platform growth can progressively introduce:

* inconsistent implementations;
* architecture drift;
* regressions;
* duplicated logic;
* unstable interfaces;
* undocumented behavior;
* security weaknesses;
* technical debt;
* testing gaps;
* release uncertainty.

Quality management therefore becomes increasingly important as the ecosystem expands.

---

## Engineering Complexity

Software quality becomes more difficult to maintain as engineering complexity increases.

FamilyOS complexity originates from several dimensions.

These include:

* multiple architectural layers;
* domain-driven design;
* plugin-based extensibility;
* capability contracts;
* internal and external integrations;
* persistent data models;
* configuration systems;
* command-line interfaces;
* automation pipelines;
* security requirements;
* testing infrastructure;
* documentation requirements;
* compatibility expectations;
* release processes.

Each dimension introduces additional quality concerns.

For example:

```text
Architecture
    ↓
Boundary Integrity

Plugins
    ↓
Compliance

Domain Models
    ↓
Correctness

Integrations
    ↓
Contract Stability

Testing
    ↓
Verification Confidence

Documentation
    ↓
Knowledge Integrity

Releases
    ↓
Delivery Confidence
```

The Quality Framework must provide a coherent approach across all these dimensions.

---

## The Quality Problem

Quality cannot be reliably achieved through isolated engineering practices.

Individual mechanisms such as:

* unit tests;
* code reviews;
* static analysis;
* type checking;
* documentation;
* integration tests;
* security checks;
* release validation;

provide important signals.

However, these signals remain incomplete when they operate independently.

A mature engineering platform requires a system capable of combining them into a coherent quality assessment.

The fundamental problem can therefore be represented as:

```text
Many Quality Signals
        ↓
No Unified Model
        ↓
Inconsistent Interpretation
        ↓
Uncertain Quality State
```

The Quality Framework transforms this into:

```text
Quality Requirements
        ↓
Quality Rules
        ↓
Quality Checks
        ↓
Quality Evidence
        ↓
Quality Assessment
        ↓
Quality Gates
        ↓
Engineering Decisions
```

---

## Quality Fragmentation

Without a common framework, quality responsibilities can become fragmented across tools and teams.

For example:

```text
Tests
    → Testing Tool

Linting
    → Static Analysis Tool

Types
    → Type Checker

Security
    → Security Scanner

Documentation
    → Documentation Validation

Architecture
    → Manual Review

Release
    → Release Checklist
```

Each mechanism may function correctly while the overall quality state remains difficult to understand.

This fragmentation creates several risks:

* inconsistent standards;
* duplicated checks;
* conflicting interpretations;
* missing quality dimensions;
* weak traceability;
* unclear ownership;
* difficult auditing;
* unreliable release decisions.

The Quality Framework establishes a common conceptual layer above individual tools.

---

## Quality Is Broader Than Testing

Testing is a critical engineering discipline.

However, testing alone does not define software quality.

A system can have extensive automated tests and still suffer from:

* poor architecture;
* excessive complexity;
* weak documentation;
* insecure dependencies;
* unstable performance;
* difficult maintenance;
* architecture violations;
* inconsistent interfaces;
* uncontrolled technical debt.

The relationship is therefore:

```text
Testing
   ↓
Verification Evidence
   ↓
Quality Assessment
```

Testing contributes evidence to quality.

It does not replace the Quality Framework.

---

## Quality Is Broader Than Code

FamilyOS quality cannot be limited to source code.

The platform includes multiple engineering artifacts.

These include:

```text
Source Code
Specifications
Architecture Documents
Tests
Configuration
Dependencies
Build Definitions
Release Metadata
Plugin Manifests
Documentation
Automation
Infrastructure
```

Each artifact can introduce quality problems.

For example:

* an incorrect specification can produce correct code implementing the wrong behavior;
* outdated documentation can create implementation errors;
* unstable dependencies can introduce runtime risk;
* incorrect configuration can invalidate otherwise correct software;
* incomplete release metadata can compromise traceability.

The Quality Framework must therefore evaluate the complete engineering system.

---

## Existing Engineering Foundations

FamilyOS already establishes several engineering foundations that contribute directly to quality.

The Engineering Foundation defines:

* development principles;
* repository organization;
* coding standards;
* engineering workflows;
* technical governance;
* lifecycle expectations.

The Documentation Framework defines:

* documentation architecture;
* documentation standards;
* documentation lifecycle;
* metadata;
* versioning;
* validation;
* traceability;
* documentation governance.

The Testing Framework defines:

* testing principles;
* testing architecture;
* testing levels;
* test execution;
* test data;
* test automation;
* testing evidence.

The Quality Framework builds upon these foundations.

It does not duplicate them.

Instead, it establishes the mechanisms required to interpret their outputs as quality evidence and transform them into engineering decisions.

---

## Relationship With the Engineering Foundation

The Engineering Foundation defines how FamilyOS engineering activities are structured.

The Quality Framework evaluates whether those activities satisfy expected quality standards.

The relationship can be represented as:

```text
Engineering Foundation
        ↓
Engineering Practices
        ↓
Quality Framework
        ↓
Quality Evaluation
```

The Engineering Foundation establishes the engineering environment.

The Quality Framework establishes how the quality of that environment and its outputs is evaluated.

---

## Relationship With the Testing Framework

The Testing Framework is one of the primary evidence providers for the Quality Framework.

It produces evidence related to:

* functional correctness;
* regression protection;
* integration behavior;
* system behavior;
* contract compatibility;
* performance;
* reliability.

The Quality Framework consumes this evidence as part of broader quality assessments.

```text
Testing Framework
        ↓
Test Results
        ↓
Test Evidence
        ↓
Quality Framework
        ↓
Quality Assessment
```

This separation preserves clear responsibilities between verification and quality governance.

---

## Relationship With the Documentation Framework

Documentation contributes directly to engineering quality.

FamilyOS depends on documentation for:

* architectural knowledge;
* engineering standards;
* specifications;
* governance rules;
* operational procedures;
* implementation guidance;
* release information.

Documentation defects can therefore become engineering defects.

The Documentation Framework defines how documentation is created and maintained.

The Quality Framework defines how documentation quality contributes to the overall quality state.

---

## Relationship With the Build Framework

Build processes transform source artifacts into executable or distributable artifacts.

Build quality therefore directly influences release confidence.

The Quality Framework may consume build evidence including:

* build success;
* reproducibility;
* dependency resolution;
* artifact integrity;
* build warnings;
* build performance.

The Build Framework remains responsible for build mechanics.

The Quality Framework evaluates their quality implications.

---

## Relationship With the Release Framework

Release decisions require confidence.

That confidence must be supported by evidence.

The Quality Framework provides quality information that may contribute to release decisions.

For example:

```text
Tests
    +
Static Analysis
    +
Architecture Validation
    +
Security Validation
    +
Documentation Validation
    +
Build Validation
    ↓
Quality Evidence
    ↓
Release Quality Gate
```

The Release Framework governs the release lifecycle.

The Quality Framework determines whether defined quality expectations have been satisfied.

---

## Relationship With Plugin Compliance

FamilyOS official plugins operate within explicit architectural and engineering constraints.

The Plugin Compliance Framework defines plugin-specific compliance requirements.

The Quality Framework provides the broader quality concepts required to evaluate those requirements.

The relationship can be represented as:

```text
Quality Framework
        ↓
General Quality Model
        ↓
Plugin Compliance Framework
        ↓
Plugin-Specific Requirements
        ↓
Plugin Validation
```

Plugin compliance therefore becomes a specialized application of the broader quality architecture.

---

## Current Quality Mechanisms

FamilyOS already uses several mechanisms that contribute to engineering quality.

These may include:

```text
Ruff
MyPy
Pytest
Architecture Rules
Documentation Standards
Specifications
Code Reviews
Git Workflows
Continuous Integration
Release Validation
```

These mechanisms provide valuable protection.

However, without a common quality model they remain individual controls.

The Quality Framework provides the architecture required to connect them.

---

## From Tools to Quality Capabilities

Quality must not be defined by specific tools.

For example:

```text
Ruff
```

is not itself the quality concept.

It implements capabilities such as:

```text
Linting
Formatting Validation
Static Analysis
```

Similarly:

```text
MyPy
```

implements:

```text
Type Verification
```

and:

```text
Pytest
```

implements:

```text
Test Execution
```

The framework therefore separates:

```text
Quality Capability
        ↓
Quality Implementation
        ↓
Tool
```

This prevents the quality architecture from becoming permanently coupled to specific technologies.

---

## Quality Requirements

Quality must begin with explicit requirements.

A quality requirement defines an expected engineering property.

Examples include:

```text
Source code must pass static analysis.

Public interfaces must satisfy typing requirements.

Critical behavior must be covered by automated tests.

Architecture boundaries must not be violated.

Documentation must satisfy required metadata.

Official plugins must satisfy compliance rules.
```

Requirements provide the foundation for measurable quality.

Without explicit requirements, quality becomes subjective.

---

## Quality Rules

Quality requirements must be translated into enforceable rules where practical.

A rule defines how a requirement is evaluated.

For example:

```text
Requirement
    ↓
Python source must satisfy static analysis standards.

Rule
    ↓
Static analysis must complete without blocking findings.
```

Rules create a bridge between engineering expectations and automated verification.

---

## Quality Checks

Quality checks execute quality rules.

A quality check may be:

* automated;
* manual;
* hybrid.

Examples include:

```text
Lint Check
Type Check
Unit Test Check
Integration Test Check
Architecture Check
Security Check
Documentation Check
Dependency Check
Performance Check
Compliance Check
```

Each check produces quality evidence.

---

## Quality Evidence

Evidence represents the observable result of quality verification.

Examples include:

```text
PASS
FAIL
WARNING
METRIC
REPORT
FINDING
EXCEPTION
```

Evidence must be sufficiently structured to support interpretation and traceability.

The Quality Framework must progressively standardize how quality evidence is represented.

---

## Quality Findings

A quality finding represents a detected quality concern.

Examples include:

* failed tests;
* type errors;
* lint violations;
* architecture violations;
* missing documentation;
* security vulnerabilities;
* performance regressions;
* dependency risks;
* compliance failures.

Findings should contain enough information to support resolution.

A useful finding may include:

```text
Identifier
Category
Rule
Severity
Location
Evidence
Description
Remediation
Status
```

This structure enables findings to participate in governance and quality reporting.

---

## Quality Severity

Not every quality finding has the same impact.

The framework must support severity classification.

A possible conceptual hierarchy is:

```text
Informational
      ↓
Low
      ↓
Medium
      ↓
High
      ↓
Critical
```

Severity allows quality decisions to consider risk rather than treating every finding identically.

---

## Quality Gates

Quality gates define decision boundaries.

A gate evaluates available evidence and determines whether an engineering transition is permitted.

Examples include:

```text
Development
      ↓
Merge Gate
      ↓
Integration
      ↓
Build Gate
      ↓
Release Candidate
      ↓
Release Gate
      ↓
Production
```

Quality gates must be based on explicit rules.

They must not depend on undocumented assumptions.

---

## Quality Metrics

Metrics provide measurable information about engineering quality.

Potential metrics include:

* test coverage;
* defect density;
* failed quality checks;
* unresolved findings;
* technical debt;
* build stability;
* test stability;
* documentation completeness;
* architecture violations;
* dependency risk;
* security findings;
* performance trends.

Metrics must support engineering decisions rather than exist only for reporting purposes.

---

## Quality Trends

A single metric value provides limited context.

The Quality Framework must therefore consider quality trends.

For example:

```text
Quality Metric
      ↓
Historical Measurements
      ↓
Trend
      ↓
Engineering Insight
```

Trends can reveal gradual degradation that individual measurements may not expose.

---

## Quality Risk

Quality management is closely connected to risk management.

Every unresolved quality concern introduces some degree of engineering risk.

The framework must support identification and evaluation of risks related to:

* correctness;
* security;
* reliability;
* maintainability;
* architecture;
* dependencies;
* performance;
* compatibility;
* documentation;
* operations.

Quality controls should become stronger as risk increases.

---

## Technical Debt Context

Technical debt is one of the primary long-term threats to platform sustainability.

Technical debt may originate from:

* temporary implementation shortcuts;
* incomplete refactoring;
* missing tests;
* architecture violations;
* outdated dependencies;
* incomplete documentation;
* duplicated logic;
* deprecated interfaces;
* unresolved defects.

Not all technical debt is inherently unacceptable.

However, invisible and unmanaged debt creates uncontrolled risk.

The Quality Framework must make significant quality debt visible and manageable.

---

## Quality Debt

Quality debt extends the concept of technical debt.

It includes any known deficiency that reduces engineering confidence.

Examples include:

```text
Missing Tests
Documentation Gaps
Known Defects
Architecture Violations
Unresolved Security Findings
Manual Validation Dependencies
Missing Automation
Unstable Tests
Performance Regressions
```

Quality debt should be tracked according to risk and remediation priority.

---

## Architecture Drift

Architecture drift occurs when implementation progressively diverges from intended architecture.

This can happen through:

* inappropriate dependencies;
* layer violations;
* bypassed abstractions;
* duplicated domain logic;
* direct infrastructure coupling;
* plugin boundary violations.

Architecture drift may remain invisible if architecture validation depends exclusively on manual review.

The Quality Framework must therefore encourage automated architecture verification wherever practical.

---

## Regression Risk

Every engineering change introduces the possibility of regression.

Regression risk increases with:

* platform complexity;
* integration count;
* shared dependencies;
* insufficient tests;
* weak contracts;
* hidden coupling.

The Quality Framework must combine multiple verification mechanisms to reduce regression risk.

These mechanisms may include:

```text
Static Verification
        +
Automated Tests
        +
Contract Validation
        +
Architecture Validation
        +
Quality Gates
```

---

## Release Uncertainty

A release should not depend primarily on subjective confidence.

Without structured quality evidence, release decisions may rely on assumptions such as:

```text
The tests passed.

The feature appears to work.

No major issue was noticed.
```

These statements provide limited confidence.

The Quality Framework must enable stronger release reasoning:

```text
Required quality checks passed.

Blocking findings are resolved.

Required evidence is available.

Known exceptions are documented.

Quality gates are satisfied.
```

This transforms release confidence into evidence-based engineering confidence.

---

## Operational Feedback

Quality does not end when software is released.

Runtime behavior provides essential information about actual system quality.

Operational evidence may include:

* failures;
* errors;
* incidents;
* latency;
* resource usage;
* unexpected behavior;
* integration failures;
* user-impacting defects.

This evidence must feed back into engineering processes.

```text
Production
    ↓
Observation
    ↓
Finding
    ↓
Analysis
    ↓
Engineering Improvement
    ↓
Verification
    ↓
Release
```

This feedback loop enables continuous improvement.

---

## Human Factors

Engineering quality depends on both systems and people.

Developers must be able to understand:

* quality expectations;
* failed checks;
* applicable rules;
* required remediation;
* quality gate decisions;
* available exceptions.

Quality systems that are difficult to understand create friction and encourage bypass behavior.

The framework must therefore prioritize clear and actionable feedback.

---

## Automation Context

Manual quality verification does not scale effectively with platform growth.

Repeated manual validation introduces:

* inconsistency;
* human error;
* slower feedback;
* increased maintenance cost;
* reduced traceability.

FamilyOS therefore requires progressive automation of quality controls.

The preferred direction is:

```text
Manual Check
      ↓
Standardized Check
      ↓
Automated Check
      ↓
Continuous Verification
      ↓
Quality Gate
```

Automation should be introduced whenever verification can be performed reliably and deterministically.

---

## Continuous Integration Context

Continuous Integration provides a natural execution environment for quality verification.

CI may execute:

```text
Formatting Validation
Linting
Type Checking
Unit Tests
Integration Tests
Architecture Validation
Security Checks
Documentation Validation
Compliance Validation
Build Verification
```

The Quality Framework defines how these results contribute to the overall quality state.

CI remains an execution mechanism.

Quality governance remains defined by the framework.

---

## Local Quality Feedback

Quality verification should not exist only in CI.

Developers should be able to reproduce important quality checks locally.

The preferred model is:

```text
Local Development
        ↓
Local Quality Checks
        ↓
Commit
        ↓
Continuous Integration
        ↓
Quality Gates
```

This reduces unnecessary CI failures and improves developer feedback speed.

---

## Quality Ownership

Quality is a shared engineering responsibility.

It cannot belong exclusively to a dedicated quality role or testing function.

Responsibility is distributed across:

```text
Architecture
Development
Testing
Documentation
Security
Operations
Governance
```

Each engineering activity contributes to the quality state of FamilyOS.

The framework establishes common expectations across these responsibilities.

---

## Governance Context

Quality rules must themselves be governed.

Rules may need to change because of:

* architecture evolution;
* platform maturity;
* new risks;
* new tools;
* ecosystem growth;
* regulatory requirements;
* engineering experience.

Changes to significant quality requirements must therefore be controlled and traceable.

The Quality Framework must define mechanisms for:

* rule ownership;
* rule lifecycle;
* versioning;
* review;
* approval;
* deprecation;
* exceptions.

---

## Quality Baselines

The framework must support quality baselines.

A baseline defines the accepted quality state at a specific point in time.

Baselines may help distinguish:

```text
Existing Quality Debt
        ↓
New Quality Regression
```

This distinction is particularly important when introducing stronger quality rules into an existing codebase.

The objective should be to prevent new degradation while progressively reducing existing debt.

---

## Incremental Adoption

The Quality Framework must support incremental adoption.

It would be unrealistic to require every quality capability to reach maximum maturity immediately.

Implementation should therefore progress through controlled stages.

For example:

```text
Define
  ↓
Measure
  ↓
Automate
  ↓
Enforce
  ↓
Observe
  ↓
Improve
```

This allows the platform to strengthen quality controls without blocking engineering evolution.

---

## Scalability Context

FamilyOS quality mechanisms must scale with the ecosystem.

A quality process that works for a small repository may become inefficient when applied to:

* hundreds of modules;
* multiple plugins;
* large test suites;
* many specifications;
* multiple release streams;
* numerous integrations.

The framework must therefore consider:

* execution performance;
* parallelization;
* incremental validation;
* selective quality checks;
* caching;
* distributed evidence;
* quality aggregation.

Scalability is an architectural requirement of the quality system.

---

## Traceability Context

As quality systems become more complex, traceability becomes essential.

Engineers must be able to understand relationships such as:

```text
Requirement
    ↓
Rule
    ↓
Check
    ↓
Evidence
    ↓
Finding
    ↓
Gate
    ↓
Decision
```

Without traceability, quality decisions become difficult to explain and audit.

Traceability therefore forms a core requirement of the framework.

---

## Explainability Context

Quality decisions must remain understandable.

An engineer encountering a failed quality gate should not need to reverse-engineer the quality system.

The framework must provide sufficient context to explain:

* what failed;
* which requirement applies;
* why the requirement exists;
* what evidence was evaluated;
* how severe the problem is;
* what remediation is expected;
* whether an exception is possible.

Explainability improves both compliance and developer experience.

---

## Quality Data

Quality mechanisms generate engineering data.

Examples include:

```text
Test Results
Coverage Reports
Static Analysis Findings
Security Findings
Build Results
Performance Measurements
Compliance Reports
Architecture Violations
Documentation Findings
```

The framework must consider how this data is:

* generated;
* represented;
* stored;
* aggregated;
* interpreted;
* retained.

Quality data becomes increasingly important as FamilyOS moves toward continuous quality observability.

---

## Quality Observability Context

A mature engineering platform should provide visibility into its own quality state.

Engineers should eventually be able to determine:

```text
Current Quality State
Quality Trends
Active Risks
Open Findings
Quality Debt
Gate Status
Release Readiness
```

without manually combining information from unrelated systems.

This requires quality observability as a first-class engineering capability.

---

## AI Context

FamilyOS includes an AI-oriented architecture and may progressively use AI to support engineering activities.

AI may assist quality processes through:

* finding classification;
* test gap analysis;
* documentation analysis;
* risk identification;
* architecture analysis;
* defect pattern detection;
* quality summarization.

However, AI-generated conclusions must not silently replace deterministic quality rules.

The authoritative quality model must remain explicit, governed, and explainable.

AI may assist quality engineering.

It must not become an opaque source of quality authority.

---

## Compliance Context

FamilyOS operates with multiple internal engineering requirements.

These may originate from:

* architecture decisions;
* specifications;
* engineering standards;
* plugin requirements;
* security requirements;
* documentation standards;
* testing standards;
* release policies.

The Quality Framework must provide mechanisms capable of incorporating these requirements into measurable compliance processes.

This enables quality and compliance to operate as connected engineering capabilities.

---

## Long-Term Engineering Context

FamilyOS is intended to remain maintainable over long periods of continuous evolution.

This requires more than short-term functional success.

The platform must preserve:

```text
Correctness
Reliability
Security
Maintainability
Testability
Observability
Compatibility
Architectural Integrity
Documentation Integrity
Engineering Knowledge
```

The Quality Framework exists to protect these properties as the ecosystem grows.

---

## Strategic Need

Without a unified Quality Framework, FamilyOS risks accumulating disconnected quality mechanisms.

The resulting model would resemble:

```text
Tests
Linting
Typing
Security
Documentation
Architecture
Build
Release
Compliance

        ↓

Independent Controls
```

The target model is:

```text
Engineering Requirements
          ↓
Quality Model
          ↓
Quality Rules
          ↓
Quality Verification
          ↓
Quality Evidence
          ↓
Quality Assessment
          ↓
Quality Gates
          ↓
Engineering Decisions
          ↓
Continuous Improvement
```

This transformation is the strategic reason for EPIC-QLT-001.

---

## Desired Quality State

The desired FamilyOS quality state is one in which significant engineering changes can be evaluated consistently.

For any relevant change, the engineering platform should eventually be capable of determining:

```text
What changed?

Which quality requirements apply?

Which checks were executed?

What evidence was produced?

Which findings exist?

What risks remain?

Which gates apply?

Can the change proceed?
```

These questions must be answerable through explicit and traceable engineering mechanisms.

---

## Context Summary

FamilyOS has reached a level of architectural and engineering maturity where isolated quality practices are no longer sufficient.

The ecosystem requires a unified framework capable of connecting:

```text
Engineering Principles
Architecture
Specifications
Development
Testing
Documentation
Security
Build
Release
Compliance
Operations
```

into a coherent quality system.

The Quality Framework provides this foundation.

It establishes the context required to move FamilyOS from:

```text
Quality through individual engineering practices
```

toward:

```text
Quality as a measurable, continuous, governed,
evidence-based engineering capability.
```

This context provides the foundation for the quality vision, principles, architecture, metrics, evidence model, risk management, automation, observability, quality gates, governance, and continuous improvement mechanisms defined throughout EPIC-QLT-001.
