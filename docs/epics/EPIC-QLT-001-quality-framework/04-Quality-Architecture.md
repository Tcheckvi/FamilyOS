# Quality Framework

## 04 Quality Architecture

### Overview

The FamilyOS Quality Architecture defines the structural model used to transform quality principles into executable engineering capabilities.

It establishes how quality requirements are represented, evaluated, measured, enforced, reported, and governed across the FamilyOS ecosystem.

The architecture provides a common foundation for:

* quality policies;
* quality requirements;
* quality rules;
* quality checks;
* quality evidence;
* quality findings;
* quality metrics;
* quality profiles;
* quality gates;
* quality reports;
* quality decisions;
* quality governance.

The purpose of this architecture is to prevent quality from becoming a collection of disconnected tools and processes.

Instead, FamilyOS quality must operate as an integrated engineering system.

---

## Architectural Objective

The primary architectural objective is to create a consistent path from engineering expectations to quality decisions.

The target model is:

```text
Quality Principle
        ↓
Quality Policy
        ↓
Quality Requirement
        ↓
Quality Rule
        ↓
Quality Check
        ↓
Quality Evidence
        ↓
Quality Finding
        ↓
Quality Assessment
        ↓
Quality Gate
        ↓
Quality Decision
```

Each stage has a distinct responsibility.

This separation improves:

* modularity;
* traceability;
* automation;
* explainability;
* governance;
* maintainability;
* extensibility.

---

## Architectural Principles

The Quality Architecture must remain consistent with the Quality Principles defined by this EPIC.

It must therefore be:

* explicit;
* modular;
* tool-independent;
* evidence-based;
* reproducible;
* traceable;
* scalable;
* explainable;
* extensible;
* governance-aware.

No quality capability should depend unnecessarily on a specific execution technology.

---

## Quality Architecture Layers

The architecture is divided into several conceptual layers.

```text
Governance Layer
        ↓
Policy Layer
        ↓
Requirement Layer
        ↓
Rule Layer
        ↓
Execution Layer
        ↓
Evidence Layer
        ↓
Assessment Layer
        ↓
Decision Layer
        ↓
Reporting Layer
```

Each layer has a specific responsibility.

---

## Governance Layer

The Governance Layer controls how quality expectations evolve.

It defines:

* ownership;
* approval;
* lifecycle;
* versioning;
* exception management;
* deprecation;
* review requirements.

The Governance Layer does not execute quality checks directly.

It ensures that the rules governing those checks remain controlled and traceable.

---

## Policy Layer

Quality policies define broad engineering expectations.

Examples may include:

```text
All production code must satisfy static analysis requirements.

Official plugins must satisfy defined compliance requirements.

Critical components must provide automated regression protection.

Release candidates must pass required quality gates.
```

Policies establish intent.

They are typically broader than individual technical rules.

---

## Requirement Layer

Quality requirements translate policies into specific expectations.

A requirement should define:

* identifier;
* description;
* applicability;
* severity;
* ownership;
* rationale;
* lifecycle status.

Example:

```text
QLT-REQ-TYP-001

All public Python interfaces must satisfy the configured type validation policy.
```

Requirements create a stable reference for downstream rules and checks.

---

## Rule Layer

Quality rules define how requirements are evaluated.

A requirement may have one or more rules.

Example:

```text
Requirement:
Public Python interfaces must satisfy type validation.

Rule:
Type checking must complete without blocking errors.
```

Rules should be:

* deterministic where possible;
* versioned;
* traceable;
* explicit;
* reusable.

---

## Execution Layer

The Execution Layer contains quality checks.

A quality check executes one or more rules against a defined target.

Examples include:

```text
Static Analysis Check
Type Verification Check
Unit Test Check
Integration Test Check
Architecture Check
Security Check
Documentation Check
Dependency Check
Performance Check
Plugin Compliance Check
```

Checks may run:

* locally;
* in pre-commit workflows;
* in CI;
* during build;
* during release validation;
* during deployment;
* periodically;
* during governance assessments.

---

## Evidence Layer

Every quality check should produce structured evidence.

Evidence represents the observable result of verification.

Examples include:

```text
PASS
FAIL
WARNING
METRIC
REPORT
ARTIFACT
FINDING
```

Evidence should include sufficient context to support later interpretation.

Possible evidence attributes include:

* check identifier;
* execution timestamp;
* target;
* rule version;
* execution environment;
* result;
* measurements;
* output artifact;
* trace identifier.

---

## Assessment Layer

The Assessment Layer interprets evidence.

A single check result may not be sufficient to determine quality status.

Assessment combines evidence according to defined rules.

For example:

```text
Unit Tests
    +
Integration Tests
    +
Static Analysis
    +
Type Checking
    ↓
Implementation Quality Assessment
```

Assessment may evaluate:

* compliance;
* risk;
* completeness;
* severity;
* trend;
* readiness.

---

## Decision Layer

The Decision Layer converts assessments into engineering decisions.

Typical decisions may include:

```text
PASS
FAIL
BLOCK
WARN
APPROVE
REJECT
CONDITIONAL APPROVAL
```

Decisions must be explainable and traceable to their evidence.

---

## Reporting Layer

The Reporting Layer exposes quality state to engineers and governance processes.

Reports may include:

* quality summaries;
* findings reports;
* gate reports;
* trend reports;
* compliance reports;
* release readiness reports;
* technical debt reports.

Reporting must not redefine quality logic.

It presents information produced by lower layers.

---

## Quality Domain Model

The Quality Architecture defines several core domain concepts.

```text
QualityPolicy
QualityRequirement
QualityRule
QualityCheck
QualityEvidence
QualityFinding
QualityMetric
QualityAssessment
QualityGate
QualityProfile
QualityException
QualityDecision
QualityReport
```

These concepts form the vocabulary of the framework.

---

## Quality Policy Model

A Quality Policy represents a broad quality expectation.

Possible attributes include:

```text
id
name
description
owner
scope
status
version
effective_date
```

Policies may reference multiple requirements.

---

## Quality Requirement Model

A Quality Requirement represents a specific expectation.

Possible attributes include:

```text
id
policy_id
title
description
rationale
scope
severity
owner
status
version
```

Requirements must remain stable enough to support traceability across framework evolution.

---

## Quality Rule Model

A Quality Rule defines an evaluable constraint.

Possible attributes include:

```text
id
requirement_id
description
category
severity
execution_type
status
version
```

Rules may be:

* automated;
* manual;
* advisory;
* blocking.

---

## Quality Check Model

A Quality Check represents an executable verification capability.

Possible attributes include:

```text
id
rule_ids
name
executor
configuration
target
timeout
execution_mode
```

A check may evaluate multiple related rules when appropriate.

---

## Quality Evidence Model

Quality Evidence captures verification results.

Possible attributes include:

```text
id
check_id
rule_id
target
result
timestamp
environment
measurements
artifact_reference
details
```

Evidence should be immutable after publication whenever practical.

---

## Quality Finding Model

A Quality Finding represents a quality concern detected from evidence.

Possible attributes include:

```text
id
rule_id
category
severity
target
location
description
evidence_id
status
owner
created_at
resolved_at
```

Findings must be actionable.

---

## Quality Metric Model

A Quality Metric represents a measurable quality signal.

Possible attributes include:

```text
id
name
category
unit
value
target
timestamp
source
scope
```

Metrics may be aggregated over time to produce trends.

---

## Quality Assessment Model

A Quality Assessment interprets a set of evidence.

Possible attributes include:

```text
id
scope
profile
evidence
findings
metrics
risk
result
timestamp
```

Assessments may operate at different scopes.

Examples include:

```text
File
Module
Package
Plugin
Repository
Build
Release
Platform
```

---

## Quality Gate Model

A Quality Gate defines transition criteria.

Possible attributes include:

```text
id
name
scope
profile
requirements
blocking_severities
required_checks
exception_policy
```

A gate evaluates an assessment and produces a decision.

---

## Quality Profile Model

A Quality Profile defines quality expectations for a specific class of component.

Examples may include:

```text
Core
Official Plugin
Internal Component
Infrastructure
Documentation
Experimental
Release Candidate
```

A profile may define:

* required rules;
* required checks;
* severity thresholds;
* minimum metrics;
* required evidence;
* gate behavior.

---

## Quality Exception Model

A Quality Exception represents an approved temporary deviation.

Possible attributes include:

```text
id
requirement_id
scope
reason
risk
owner
approver
created_at
expires_at
remediation_plan
status
```

Exceptions must never silently disable quality controls.

---

## Quality Decision Model

A Quality Decision represents the final outcome of an evaluation.

Possible attributes include:

```text
id
gate_id
assessment_id
result
reason
timestamp
approver
exception_ids
```

The decision must remain traceable to its inputs.

---

## Quality Report Model

A Quality Report presents quality information.

Reports may include:

```text
Summary
Scope
Assessment Result
Gate Status
Findings
Metrics
Trends
Exceptions
Risk
Recommendations
```

Reports should be generated from structured quality data whenever practical.

---

## Quality Scope

Quality checks may operate at different scopes.

The architecture must support hierarchical evaluation.

```text
File
  ↓
Module
  ↓
Package
  ↓
Capability
  ↓
Plugin
  ↓
Repository
  ↓
Build
  ↓
Release
  ↓
Platform
```

Evidence generated at lower levels may contribute to higher-level assessments.

---

## Quality Aggregation

Higher-level quality state should be derived from lower-level evidence.

For example:

```text
File Findings
      ↓
Module Assessment
      ↓
Package Assessment
      ↓
Plugin Assessment
      ↓
Release Assessment
```

Aggregation rules must be explicit.

A high-level PASS must not hide unresolved blocking findings from lower levels.

---

## Quality Categories

The architecture should support standardized quality categories.

Initial categories may include:

```text
Correctness
Architecture
Maintainability
Reliability
Security
Performance
Testing
Documentation
Compatibility
Dependency
Compliance
Observability
Build
Release
Infrastructure
```

Categories enable consistent reporting and ownership.

---

## Severity Model

Findings require a standardized severity model.

A baseline hierarchy may include:

```text
INFO
LOW
MEDIUM
HIGH
CRITICAL
```

Severity should reflect engineering impact rather than tool-specific terminology.

Tool outputs may need normalization into this common model.

---

## Result Model

Quality checks and assessments should use standardized results.

Possible check results:

```text
PASS
FAIL
WARNING
SKIPPED
ERROR
NOT_APPLICABLE
```

Possible gate decisions:

```text
PASS
FAIL
CONDITIONAL_PASS
```

These states must have defined semantics.

---

## Tool Adapters

The Quality Architecture must isolate tool-specific implementations.

The preferred model is:

```text
Quality Capability
       ↓
Tool Adapter
       ↓
External Tool
```

Examples:

```text
Static Analysis
       ↓
Ruff Adapter
       ↓
Ruff

Type Verification
       ↓
MyPy Adapter
       ↓
MyPy

Test Execution
       ↓
Pytest Adapter
       ↓
Pytest
```

Adapters normalize tool-specific outputs into FamilyOS quality evidence.

---

## Tool Independence

The framework must allow tools to be replaced without redefining the conceptual quality architecture.

For example:

```text
Quality Rule
       ↓
Type Verification Capability
       ↓
Current Tool
```

If the current implementation changes, the requirement and rule can remain stable.

This separation is critical for long-term maintainability.

---

## Quality Execution Engine

The architecture may introduce a Quality Execution Engine.

Its responsibility would be to:

* discover applicable checks;
* load quality profiles;
* resolve configuration;
* execute checks;
* collect evidence;
* normalize results;
* publish findings;
* trigger assessments.

Conceptually:

```text
Target
  ↓
Profile Resolution
  ↓
Check Discovery
  ↓
Execution
  ↓
Evidence Collection
```

The engine should orchestrate quality capabilities without embedding tool-specific logic.

---

## Quality Assessment Engine

A Quality Assessment Engine may evaluate collected evidence.

Its responsibilities may include:

* finding normalization;
* severity interpretation;
* metric evaluation;
* risk calculation;
* baseline comparison;
* exception application;
* readiness evaluation.

Conceptually:

```text
Evidence
   ↓
Normalization
   ↓
Assessment Rules
   ↓
Quality State
```

---

## Quality Gate Engine

A Quality Gate Engine may evaluate assessments against transition criteria.

```text
Assessment
    +
Profile
    +
Gate Definition
    +
Exceptions
    ↓
Decision
```

The gate engine must produce explainable outcomes.

---

## Quality Registry

The framework may maintain a registry containing:

* policies;
* requirements;
* rules;
* checks;
* profiles;
* gates;
* adapters.

A registry enables controlled discovery.

Conceptually:

```text
Quality Registry
      ├── Policies
      ├── Requirements
      ├── Rules
      ├── Checks
      ├── Profiles
      └── Gates
```

Registry entries should be versioned.

---

## Quality Configuration

Quality behavior requires configuration.

Configuration may define:

* enabled checks;
* profile assignment;
* thresholds;
* execution options;
* exclusions;
* severity mappings;
* timeout values;
* gate behavior.

Configuration must remain explicit and version-controlled where practical.

Hidden local configuration must not determine authoritative quality state.

---

## Default Quality Configuration

The framework should provide safe defaults.

Default configuration may establish:

* baseline rules;
* standard severity mapping;
* default quality profile;
* standard checks;
* standard quality gates.

Projects may extend these defaults according to documented rules.

---

## Configuration Precedence

If multiple configuration sources exist, precedence must be deterministic.

A possible model is:

```text
Framework Defaults
        ↓
Repository Configuration
        ↓
Component Profile
        ↓
Approved Override
```

Environment-specific configuration must not silently weaken mandatory quality requirements.

---

## Quality Discovery

The architecture should support automatic discovery of applicable quality capabilities.

For example:

```text
Python Source
    ↓
Static Analysis
Type Verification
Testing

Documentation
    ↓
Metadata Validation
Link Validation
Structure Validation

Plugin
    ↓
Plugin Compliance
Architecture Validation
Capability Validation
```

Discovery rules must remain predictable.

---

## Execution Modes

Quality checks may support several execution modes.

Examples include:

```text
FAST
STANDARD
FULL
RELEASE
```

A FAST mode may prioritize development feedback.

A FULL mode may execute broader validation.

A RELEASE mode may include all mandatory release evidence.

Execution modes must not create ambiguity about authoritative results.

---

## Local Execution

Important quality checks should be executable locally.

Local execution supports:

* rapid feedback;
* reproducibility;
* developer autonomy;
* CI troubleshooting.

The local quality environment should approximate authoritative CI behavior as closely as practical.

---

## CI Execution

CI is the primary shared execution environment for automated quality checks.

The architecture should allow CI to execute:

```text
Quality Profile Resolution
          ↓
Required Checks
          ↓
Evidence Collection
          ↓
Assessment
          ↓
Gate Evaluation
```

CI output should remain consistent with local execution.

---

## Release Execution

Release validation may activate stronger quality requirements.

For example:

```text
Development Profile
        ↓
Standard Checks

Release Profile
        ↓
Full Test Suite
Security Validation
Documentation Validation
Compatibility Validation
Build Verification
Release Gate
```

Release controls should build upon normal quality mechanisms rather than create an unrelated validation system.

---

## Incremental Quality Execution

Large systems require efficient validation.

The architecture should support incremental execution where correctness can be preserved.

Possible strategies include:

* changed-file detection;
* dependency impact analysis;
* affected-module execution;
* cached evidence;
* selective test execution.

Incremental execution must not create false confidence.

Full verification must remain available where required.

---

## Parallel Quality Execution

Independent checks should be capable of parallel execution.

Example:

```text
             ┌─ Static Analysis
             ├─ Type Checking
Source ──────┼─ Unit Tests
             ├─ Documentation
             └─ Security Checks
```

Parallelization reduces feedback time while preserving independent evidence.

---

## Quality Evidence Store

The architecture may include a Quality Evidence Store.

Its purpose is to preserve structured evidence.

Possible stored artifacts include:

* check results;
* metrics;
* findings;
* reports;
* gate decisions;
* exceptions.

Evidence retention enables:

* auditing;
* trend analysis;
* debugging;
* release reconstruction;
* quality history.

---

## Evidence Immutability

Published evidence should not be silently modified.

If evidence is corrected or superseded, the change should remain traceable.

The preferred model is:

```text
Evidence v1
     ↓
Superseded by
     ↓
Evidence v2
```

rather than destructive modification.

---

## Evidence Identity

Evidence should have stable identifiers.

This enables relationships such as:

```text
Finding
   ↓
Evidence ID

Assessment
   ↓
Evidence IDs

Decision
   ↓
Assessment ID
```

Stable identity is essential for traceability.

---

## Quality Baselines

The architecture should support baselines.

A baseline represents an accepted quality state.

Baselines may be used to distinguish:

```text
Existing Finding
       ↓
Known Debt
```

from:

```text
New Finding
       ↓
Regression
```

Baselines must be explicit and controlled.

---

## Baseline Evolution

Baselines should improve over time.

The intended direction is:

```text
Baseline N
   ↓
Debt Reduction
   ↓
Baseline N+1
```

A baseline must not become a permanent mechanism for ignoring quality debt.

---

## Quality Risk Integration

Quality assessment should integrate risk information.

Risk may influence:

* severity;
* required checks;
* gate thresholds;
* review requirements;
* exception approval.

Conceptually:

```text
Finding
   +
Context
   +
Criticality
   ↓
Risk Evaluation
```

Risk-based evaluation prevents uniform rules from creating inappropriate outcomes.

---

## Criticality Model

Components may have different criticality levels.

A baseline model might include:

```text
LOW
STANDARD
HIGH
CRITICAL
```

Criticality may depend on:

* security;
* data sensitivity;
* platform importance;
* operational impact;
* compatibility impact.

Quality profiles may inherit criticality-specific requirements.

---

## Quality Profile Inheritance

Profiles should support controlled inheritance.

Example:

```text
Base Profile
     ↓
Production Profile
     ↓
Official Plugin Profile
```

A specialized profile may strengthen requirements.

It must not silently remove mandatory inherited rules.

---

## Profile Composition

Where appropriate, profiles may compose quality domains.

For example:

```text
Official Plugin Profile
        =
Base Engineering Quality
        +
Plugin Compliance
        +
Security Requirements
        +
Documentation Requirements
```

Composition reduces duplication.

---

## Quality Gate Hierarchy

Gates may exist at multiple lifecycle stages.

```text
Developer Gate
      ↓
Merge Gate
      ↓
Integration Gate
      ↓
Build Gate
      ↓
Release Gate
      ↓
Deployment Gate
```

Each gate should evaluate only the evidence relevant to its transition.

---

## Developer Gate

The Developer Gate focuses on fast local feedback.

It may include:

* formatting;
* linting;
* focused tests;
* type checks;
* basic documentation validation.

It should be optimized for speed.

---

## Merge Gate

The Merge Gate protects shared branches.

It may require:

* mandatory tests;
* static analysis;
* type verification;
* architecture checks;
* required documentation;
* blocking finding resolution.

The Merge Gate should prevent predictable regressions from entering the main development line.

---

## Integration Gate

The Integration Gate evaluates interactions between components.

It may include:

* integration tests;
* contract tests;
* compatibility checks;
* dependency validation;
* plugin interaction verification.

---

## Build Gate

The Build Gate verifies artifact creation.

It may evaluate:

* build success;
* reproducibility;
* dependency resolution;
* artifact integrity;
* packaging validation.

---

## Release Gate

The Release Gate determines whether a release candidate satisfies required quality conditions.

It may aggregate evidence from:

```text
Testing
Architecture
Security
Documentation
Build
Compatibility
Compliance
```

Release decisions must remain traceable.

---

## Deployment Gate

Where applicable, deployment may require additional validation.

Possible checks include:

* environment configuration;
* deployment integrity;
* migration readiness;
* operational prerequisites.

Deployment gates must remain aligned with the broader quality model.

---

## Exception Processing

Exceptions must participate explicitly in gate evaluation.

Example:

```text
Blocking Finding
      ↓
Approved Exception?
      ├── No → FAIL
      └── Yes → CONDITIONAL_PASS
```

The decision must reference the exception.

Expired exceptions must no longer apply.

---

## Quality Architecture Boundaries

The Quality Framework must not absorb responsibilities owned by other frameworks.

For example:

The Testing Framework owns testing strategy.

The Quality Framework consumes test evidence.

The Documentation Framework owns documentation lifecycle rules.

The Quality Framework evaluates documentation quality evidence.

The Build Framework owns artifact construction.

The Quality Framework consumes build evidence.

This separation avoids duplication.

---

## Integration With Testing Framework

The integration model is:

```text
Testing Framework
      ↓
Test Execution
      ↓
Test Evidence
      ↓
Quality Assessment
```

The Quality Architecture does not redefine test levels or testing methodology.

---

## Integration With Documentation Framework

The Documentation Framework may provide:

* structural validation;
* metadata validation;
* link validation;
* lifecycle status;
* completeness evidence.

The Quality Framework consumes these outputs as documentation quality evidence.

---

## Integration With Build Framework

The Build Framework provides evidence related to:

* build success;
* build reproducibility;
* artifact generation;
* dependency resolution.

These signals may contribute to quality gates.

---

## Integration With Release Framework

The Release Framework defines release lifecycle mechanics.

The Quality Framework provides release readiness decisions and evidence.

```text
Quality Gate
     ↓
Release Readiness
     ↓
Release Framework
```

---

## Integration With Plugin Compliance Framework

Plugin Compliance is a specialized quality domain.

The Plugin Compliance Framework may define:

* plugin requirements;
* plugin rules;
* plugin evidence;
* plugin findings.

The Quality Framework provides the common assessment and gate architecture.

---

## Integration With Security

Security tools and frameworks may generate findings.

These findings should be normalized into the common quality model.

```text
Security Scanner
      ↓
Security Adapter
      ↓
Quality Evidence
      ↓
Security Finding
      ↓
Quality Assessment
```

---

## Integration With Observability

Runtime observability provides post-release quality evidence.

Operational signals may generate:

* reliability findings;
* performance findings;
* regression findings;
* incident evidence.

These signals should feed continuous quality improvement.

---

## Quality Events

The architecture may emit quality lifecycle events.

Examples include:

```text
quality.check.started
quality.check.completed
quality.finding.created
quality.finding.resolved
quality.assessment.completed
quality.gate.passed
quality.gate.failed
quality.exception.created
quality.exception.expired
```

Events may support integration with reporting, automation, or observability systems.

---

## Quality APIs

The architecture should allow quality capabilities to be exposed through stable APIs.

Possible operations include:

```text
run_checks()
collect_evidence()
evaluate_assessment()
evaluate_gate()
list_findings()
resolve_finding()
get_quality_status()
generate_report()
```

These interfaces should remain independent from individual tools.

---

## CLI Integration

FamilyOS may expose quality operations through the CLI.

Conceptual commands could include:

```text
familyos quality check
familyos quality status
familyos quality report
familyos quality findings
familyos quality gate
familyos quality profile
```

CLI design remains subject to separate implementation decisions.

The architecture only defines the capability boundary.

---

## Quality Automation Interface

Automation systems must be able to invoke quality capabilities consistently.

The preferred relationship is:

```text
CI / Automation
       ↓
Quality API
       ↓
Quality Engine
       ↓
Checks
```

Automation should not require direct knowledge of every underlying tool.

---

## Quality Reporting Architecture

Reports should be generated from structured quality data.

The reporting pipeline may follow:

```text
Evidence
   ↓
Findings
   ↓
Assessment
   ↓
Metrics
   ↓
Report Generator
   ↓
Human / Machine Output
```

Output formats may eventually include:

* terminal;
* Markdown;
* JSON;
* HTML;
* CI annotations;
* dashboards.

---

## Machine-Readable Quality Data

Machine-readable quality data is important for automation.

Structured formats should support:

* CI integration;
* dashboards;
* trend analysis;
* release automation;
* AI-assisted analysis.

Machine-readable output must preserve the same semantic model as human-readable reports.

---

## Human-Readable Quality Data

Human-readable reports must prioritize:

* clarity;
* severity;
* remediation;
* scope;
* evidence;
* decision explanation.

Engineers should not need to inspect raw tool output to understand a quality failure.

---

## Quality Architecture Security

The quality system itself must be protected against manipulation.

Potential risks include:

* disabled checks;
* altered evidence;
* unauthorized exceptions;
* modified thresholds;
* falsified gate results.

Security-sensitive quality configuration should therefore be version-controlled and reviewable.

---

## Quality Architecture Reliability

Quality infrastructure must be reliable.

A failed quality system must not silently produce a PASS.

Execution errors must be distinguishable from successful validation.

For example:

```text
Check Success
    → PASS / FAIL

Check Infrastructure Failure
    → ERROR
```

An ERROR must not automatically become PASS.

---

## Fail-Safe Behavior

Critical quality mechanisms should prefer fail-safe behavior.

For blocking checks:

```text
Unable to Verify
      ↓
Do Not Assume Compliance
```

The exact behavior may depend on risk and gate policy.

---

## Quality Architecture Performance

Quality validation must remain operationally practical.

The architecture should support:

* parallel execution;
* caching;
* incremental checks;
* execution profiles;
* timeout control;
* prioritization.

Performance optimization must not weaken required assurance.

---

## Quality Architecture Extensibility

New quality domains must be addable without redesigning the complete framework.

For example:

```text
Existing Domains
     +
New Accessibility Quality Domain
```

should integrate through existing concepts:

```text
Requirements
Rules
Checks
Evidence
Findings
Assessments
Gates
```

This extensibility is a primary architectural goal.

---

## Plugin-Based Quality Capabilities

FamilyOS may eventually allow quality capabilities to be implemented as plugins.

Possible quality plugin categories include:

```text
Check Provider
Evidence Provider
Metric Provider
Report Provider
Gate Provider
```

Such extensibility must remain controlled by the Plugin Architecture and Plugin Compliance Framework.

---

## Quality Architecture Versioning

The Quality Architecture itself must evolve through controlled versions.

Significant changes to:

* evidence models;
* severity semantics;
* gate behavior;
* profile inheritance;
* quality APIs;

must consider compatibility.

Versioned contracts may be required.

---

## Compatibility Requirements

Quality automation may depend on stable output formats and APIs.

Therefore, breaking changes must be explicit.

Potentially affected consumers include:

* CI pipelines;
* release automation;
* dashboards;
* plugins;
* reporting systems;
* external integrations.

Compatibility must be considered as part of framework evolution.

---

## Quality Architecture Testing

The quality system itself must be tested.

Testing should cover:

* rule evaluation;
* check orchestration;
* evidence normalization;
* severity mapping;
* gate decisions;
* exception handling;
* profile inheritance;
* reporting.

Quality infrastructure must not be exempt from the quality standards it enforces.

---

## Quality Architecture Observability

The quality system should expose its own operational state.

Useful signals may include:

* check execution duration;
* check failure rate;
* infrastructure errors;
* flaky checks;
* gate frequency;
* finding volume;
* false-positive rate.

This helps improve the Quality Framework itself.

---

## Quality Architecture Maturity

The architecture should support progressive implementation.

A possible maturity sequence is:

```text
Stage 1
Independent Quality Tools

        ↓

Stage 2
Standardized Quality Rules

        ↓

Stage 3
Structured Evidence

        ↓

Stage 4
Unified Assessments

        ↓

Stage 5
Automated Quality Gates

        ↓

Stage 6
Central Quality Observability

        ↓

Stage 7
Continuous Quality Intelligence
```

The framework must allow this evolution without requiring all capabilities immediately.

---

## Initial Implementation Boundary

The first implementation of the Quality Architecture does not need to implement every conceptual component.

Initial capabilities may focus on:

* standardized checks;
* structured results;
* quality findings;
* basic profiles;
* quality gate evaluation;
* CI integration.

More advanced capabilities may follow progressively.

---

## Future Quality Intelligence

As the architecture matures, structured quality data may support advanced analysis.

Examples include:

* quality trend prediction;
* defect risk estimation;
* architecture degradation detection;
* technical debt prioritization;
* test gap analysis;
* release risk assessment.

These capabilities depend on reliable foundational quality data.

---

## AI Integration Boundary

AI-assisted quality capabilities must operate above authoritative deterministic evidence.

The preferred architecture is:

```text
Quality Evidence
      ↓
Deterministic Assessment
      ↓
Authoritative Quality State
      ↓
AI-Assisted Interpretation
```

AI must not silently modify authoritative results.

---

## Architectural Anti-Patterns

The Quality Architecture explicitly rejects several patterns.

### Tool-Centric Architecture

Quality must not be structured around individual tools.

### Hidden Quality Logic

Mandatory requirements must not exist only inside CI scripts.

### Unstructured Evidence

Raw command output alone is insufficient as a long-term evidence model.

### Silent Exceptions

Bypasses must be explicit and traceable.

### Inconsistent Severity

Tool-specific severity must be normalized.

### Non-Reproducible Gates

Gate decisions must be reproducible from defined evidence and rules.

### Monolithic Quality Engine

Quality capabilities should remain modular and extensible.

## Reference Architecture

The target conceptual architecture is:

```

This architecture provides the structural foundation for the complete Quality Framework.

---

## Architectural Outcome

The Quality Architecture transforms FamilyOS quality from:

```text
Independent Tools
       +
Manual Interpretation
       +
Implicit Decisions
```

into:

```text
Explicit Requirements
        ↓
Standardized Verification
        ↓
Structured Evidence
        ↓
Consistent Assessment
        ↓
Controlled Quality Gates
        ↓
Traceable Decisions
```

This transition is essential for quality management at platform scale.

---

## Final Architecture Principle

The Quality Architecture must make quality executable without making quality opaque.

The framework must preserve a clear relationship between:

```text
Engineering Intent
        ↓
Quality Requirement
        ↓
Verification
        ↓
Evidence
        ↓
Decision
```

Every significant quality decision should remain understandable, reproducible, and traceable.

This architecture establishes the structural foundation required for FamilyOS to operate quality as a continuous, automated, measurable, governed, and extensible engineering capability.
