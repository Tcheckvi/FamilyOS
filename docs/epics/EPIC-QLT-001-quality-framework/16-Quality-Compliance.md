# Quality Framework

## 16 Quality Compliance

### Overview

The FamilyOS Quality Compliance model defines how engineering artifacts, components, plugins, documentation, processes, builds, releases, and other governed targets demonstrate conformity with applicable FamilyOS quality requirements.

Quality Compliance establishes a structured relationship between:

```text
Quality Policy
      ↓
Quality Requirements
      ↓
Compliance Rules
      ↓
Verification
      ↓
Evidence
      ↓
Compliance Assessment
      ↓
Compliance State
      ↓
Engineering Decision
```

Compliance is not treated as a separate administrative activity performed after engineering work is complete.

Within FamilyOS, compliance is an integrated engineering capability.

It ensures that required quality expectations are:

* explicit;
* testable where practical;
* traceable;
* evidence-based;
* versioned;
* reviewable;
* enforceable;
* auditable.

The central question answered by Quality Compliance is:

```text
Does this target satisfy every applicable mandatory
quality requirement defined by FamilyOS governance?
```

---

## Purpose

The purpose of Quality Compliance is to provide a consistent mechanism for demonstrating that FamilyOS engineering work conforms to established requirements.

Without a compliance model, requirements may exist across:

```text
Architecture Documentation
Engineering Standards
Testing Framework
Quality Framework
Security Policies
Plugin Specifications
Documentation Standards
Release Policies
ADRs
RFCs
```

but remain difficult to evaluate consistently.

The desired model is:

```text
Distributed Requirements
      ↓
Normalized Compliance Requirements
      ↓
Compliance Profiles
      ↓
Automated and Manual Verification
      ↓
Compliance Evidence
      ↓
Compliance Assessment
      ↓
Compliance Decision
```

This converts distributed engineering expectations into governed, verifiable conformity.

---

## Foundational Principle

The foundational principle is:

> Every mandatory FamilyOS engineering requirement must have a clear path from authoritative definition to verifiable compliance evidence.

A requirement that cannot be traced to its authority or evaluated consistently creates governance ambiguity.

Compliance therefore depends on:

```text
Authority
+
Requirement
+
Applicability
+
Verification
+
Evidence
+
Decision
```

---

## Compliance Definition

Quality Compliance is the demonstrated conformity of a governed target with applicable FamilyOS quality requirements.

Conceptually:

```text
Compliance
=
Applicable Requirements
+
Satisfactory Evidence
+
Valid Assessment
```

Compliance is always relative to a defined requirement set.

A target cannot meaningfully be described as simply:

```text
COMPLIANT
```

without understanding:

```text
Compliant with what?
Under which profile?
At which revision?
Using which evidence?
```

---

## Compliance Target

A Compliance Target is the engineering entity being evaluated.

Targets may include:

```text
Repository
Component
Module
Plugin
Service
Package
Documentation Set
Build
Artifact
Release Candidate
Release
Configuration
Engineering Process
```

Every compliance assessment must identify its target explicitly.

---

## Target Identity

A target should have sufficient identity to support reproducible assessment.

Conceptually:

```text
target_type
target_id
revision
version
context
```

For source-controlled targets, the revision should normally be included.

---

## Compliance Scope

Compliance scope defines which part of the target is being evaluated.

Examples include:

```text
Complete Repository
Official Plugin
Documentation Package
Release Artifact
Architecture Boundary
Security-Sensitive Component
```

Scope must be explicit.

Partial compliance must not be represented as complete compliance.

---

## Compliance Authority

Every compliance requirement must originate from an authoritative source.

Potential authorities include:

```text
Engineering Constitution
Architecture Foundation
Quality Framework
Testing Framework
Documentation Framework
Security Architecture
Plugin Compliance Framework
ADRs
RFCs
Specifications
Release Governance
```

The source determines why the requirement exists.

---

## Requirement Provenance

A compliance requirement should preserve provenance.

Example:

```text
Requirement:
Official plugins must expose valid plugin metadata.

Authority:
ADR-0007

Derived Rule:
PLUGIN-METADATA-001
```

This creates traceability from implementation rule to architectural decision.

---

## Compliance Requirement

A Compliance Requirement defines a condition that a target must satisfy.

A requirement should answer:

```text
What is required?

Why is it required?

Where does it apply?

How can conformity be demonstrated?
```

---

## Requirement Identity

Formal requirements should have stable identifiers.

A conceptual format may be:

```text
QLT-REQ-<DOMAIN>-<NUMBER>
```

Examples:

```text
QLT-REQ-ARCH-001
QLT-REQ-TEST-004
QLT-REQ-DOC-003
QLT-REQ-REL-002
```

Stable identifiers support:

* automation;
* traceability;
* findings;
* reporting;
* versioning;
* governance.

---

## Requirement Metadata

A compliance requirement may contain:

```text
id
title
description
authority
domain
severity
applicability
verification_method
evidence_requirements
profile_membership
version
status
```

---

## Requirement Language

Requirements should use precise normative language.

Typical terms include:

```text
MUST
MUST NOT
SHOULD
SHOULD NOT
MAY
```

Mandatory compliance rules generally derive from:

```text
MUST
MUST NOT
```

Recommendations may participate in quality assessments without necessarily blocking compliance.

---

## Mandatory Requirement

A Mandatory Requirement must be satisfied unless an authorized exception explicitly applies.

Conceptually:

```text
Mandatory Requirement
      ↓
Satisfied?
      ├── Yes → COMPLIANT
      └── No  → NON_COMPLIANT
```

---

## Recommended Requirement

A Recommended Requirement represents an expected engineering practice whose absence may not automatically create non-compliance.

Possible outcomes include:

```text
WARNING
ADVISORY
QUALITY_DEBT
```

depending on policy.

---

## Optional Requirement

Optional requirements provide supported capabilities or guidance without affecting compliance when not adopted.

---

## Compliance Rule

A Compliance Rule is an executable or reviewable interpretation of a requirement.

Conceptually:

```text
Requirement
      ↓
Compliance Rule
      ↓
Verification
```

One requirement may produce several rules.

---

## Requirement vs Rule

The distinction is:

```text
Requirement:
Official plugins MUST declare a unique identifier.

Rule:
Validate plugin metadata and verify that the identifier
exists, follows naming rules, and is unique.
```

Requirements define expectations.

Rules define verification logic.

---

## Rule Identity

Compliance rules should have stable identifiers.

A conceptual format may be:

```text
QLT-COMP-<DOMAIN>-<NUMBER>
```

or reuse governed domain-specific rule identities where appropriate.

The identifier model should remain consistent across the FamilyOS quality ecosystem.

---

## Rule Metadata

A compliance rule may contain:

```text
id
requirement
description
domain
severity
applicability
verification
evidence_type
automation
version
```

---

## Compliance Domain

Requirements should be organized into meaningful domains.

Potential domains include:

```text
Engineering
Architecture
Code
Testing
Security
Documentation
Dependencies
Build
Release
Plugin
Configuration
Observability
Governance
```

Domains support modular assessment.

---

## Engineering Compliance

Engineering compliance may verify:

* repository conventions;
* coding standards;
* development workflow;
* required tooling;
* engineering metadata.

---

## Architecture Compliance

Architecture compliance may verify:

```text
Dependency Direction
Layer Boundaries
Domain Isolation
Public Contracts
Plugin Boundaries
Architecture Decisions
```

Architecture compliance protects structural integrity.

---

## Code Compliance

Code compliance may include:

```text
Formatting
Linting
Typing
Naming
Complexity Rules
Forbidden Patterns
```

Code compliance should rely heavily on deterministic automation.

---

## Testing Compliance

Testing compliance may verify:

```text
Required Test Levels
Required Test Locations
Test Execution
Required Test Success
Regression Protection
Test Evidence
```

The Testing Framework remains authoritative for testing semantics.

---

## Security Compliance

Security compliance may verify:

```text
Security Requirements
Dependency Security
Secret Handling
Authorization Boundaries
Security-Sensitive Configuration
Security Evidence
```

Security requirements may use stricter enforcement than general quality requirements.

---

## Documentation Compliance

Documentation compliance may verify:

```text
Required Documents
Document Structure
Metadata
Naming
References
Versioning
Traceability
```

The Documentation Framework remains authoritative for documentation-specific requirements.

---

## Dependency Compliance

Dependency compliance may verify:

* approved dependency policy;
* supported versions;
* licensing requirements where applicable;
* vulnerability policy;
* dependency declarations.

---

## Build Compliance

Build compliance may verify:

```text
Reproducibility
Artifact Structure
Version Metadata
Dependency Resolution
Build Configuration
```

---

## Release Compliance

Release compliance may verify:

```text
Versioning
Release Evidence
Required Assessments
Documentation
Artifact Integrity
Quality Gates
Release Metadata
```

---

## Plugin Compliance

Plugin compliance is a specialized compliance domain.

Official FamilyOS plugins may require:

```text
Architecture Compliance
Metadata Compliance
Capability Compliance
Testing Compliance
Documentation Compliance
Quality Compliance
```

The Plugin Compliance Framework provides the authoritative detailed model for plugin conformity.

---

## Governance Compliance

Governance compliance may verify:

* required approvals;
* decision records;
* exceptions;
* risk acceptance;
* release authority.

Some governance requirements require human evidence.

---

## Compliance Profile

A Compliance Profile defines the set of requirements applicable to a class of targets.

Conceptually:

```text
Compliance Profile
=
Requirement Set
+
Applicability Rules
+
Severity Policy
+
Evidence Requirements
```

Profiles prevent every target from being evaluated against every possible requirement.

---

## Profile Identity

Profiles should have stable identities.

Examples:

```text
familyos-core
official-plugin
documentation
release
critical-release
```

Versioning may be applied where profile evolution affects interpretation.

---

## Base Profile

A Base Profile may define requirements common to most FamilyOS engineering targets.

Example:

```text
Base Engineering Profile

Formatting
Linting
Typing
Required Tests
Repository Structure
Documentation Metadata
```

---

## Specialized Profiles

Specialized profiles may extend base requirements.

Example:

```text
Base Engineering Profile
      +
Official Plugin Profile
      +
Security-Sensitive Profile
```

---

## Profile Composition

Profiles should support controlled composition.

Conceptually:

```text
Base
  ↓
Plugin
  ↓
Official Plugin
  ↓
Security-Sensitive Official Plugin
```

Composition should avoid duplicated or contradictory requirements.

---

## Profile Resolution

The applicable profile may be determined by:

```text
Target Type
Target Classification
Criticality
Lifecycle Stage
Domain
Release Context
```

Profile resolution should be deterministic where possible.

---

## Applicability

Not every requirement applies to every target.

A requirement should define applicability conditions.

Example:

```text
Requirement:
Plugin manifest must exist.

Applies To:
Plugin targets only.
```

---

## Applicability Evaluation

Applicability may produce:

```text
APPLICABLE
NOT_APPLICABLE
UNKNOWN
```

Unknown applicability should be resolved before authoritative compliance is declared.

---

## Conditional Applicability

Some requirements apply only when a condition exists.

Example:

```text
If external network communication is implemented,
network security requirements apply.
```

Conditional applicability should be explicit.

---

## Applicability Evidence

Where applicability is non-trivial, the reason should be recorded.

Example:

```text
Requirement:
External API authentication policy

State:
NOT_APPLICABLE

Reason:
Target exposes no external API.
```

---

## Compliance Verification

Verification determines whether an applicable requirement is satisfied.

Verification methods may include:

```text
Static Analysis
Test Execution
Schema Validation
Repository Inspection
Architecture Analysis
Dependency Analysis
Document Validation
Human Review
Artifact Inspection
Runtime Verification
```

---

## Automated Verification

Automated verification should be preferred when a requirement is:

* deterministic;
* repeatable;
* machine-readable;
* frequently evaluated.

Examples include:

```text
File Exists
Metadata Valid
Tests Pass
No Forbidden Dependency
Naming Convention Valid
```

---

## Manual Verification

Manual verification remains appropriate for requirements involving:

```text
Architecture Intent
Risk Acceptance
Documentation Meaning
Design Quality
Governance Approval
```

Manual verification must still produce structured evidence.

---

## Hybrid Verification

Some requirements require both automation and human review.

Example:

```text
Architecture Change
      ↓
Automated Dependency Validation
      +
Architecture Review
```

Both forms of evidence may be required.

---

## Verification Method Authority

The requirement definition should identify acceptable verification methods.

A team should not replace a required security review with an unrelated successful test suite.

---

## Compliance Evidence

Compliance Evidence demonstrates whether a requirement is satisfied.

Examples include:

```text
Test Result
Static Analysis Result
Validated Metadata
Architecture Report
Review Approval
Artifact Inspection
Dependency Report
Document Validation Result
```

Evidence should integrate with the broader Quality Evidence model.

---

## Evidence Identity

Formal compliance evidence should be traceable.

Conceptually:

```text
QLT-EVID-<IDENTIFIER>
```

The same evidence may support multiple requirements where appropriate.

---

## Evidence Freshness

Compliance evidence must correspond to the relevant target state.

Example:

```text
Evidence Revision:
abc123

Target Revision:
def456

Compliance:
Cannot be assumed.
```

---

## Evidence Completeness

Compliance cannot be declared when mandatory evidence is missing.

Conceptually:

```text
Mandatory Requirements:
10

Verified:
9

Missing Evidence:
1

Overall Compliance:
INCOMPLETE
```

A simple percentage must not hide missing mandatory evidence.

---

## Evidence Validity

Evidence must be:

* authentic;
* relevant;
* sufficiently current;
* generated by an acceptable verification method.

Invalid evidence should not contribute to compliance.

---

## Evidence Reuse

Evidence may be reused when:

```text
Target Unchanged
Requirement Unchanged
Verification Still Applicable
Evidence Still Fresh
```

Evidence reuse should reduce unnecessary repeated work.

---

## Evidence Invalidation

Evidence should be invalidated when relevant conditions change.

Examples include:

* target revision changed;
* requirement changed;
* verification method changed;
* dependency state changed;
* evidence expired.

---

## Compliance Finding

A Compliance Finding represents detected non-conformity or uncertainty related to a compliance requirement.

A finding should reference:

```text
Target
Requirement
Rule
Evidence
Severity
Status
```

---

## Finding Types

Compliance findings may include:

```text
NON_CONFORMITY
MISSING_EVIDENCE
INVALID_EVIDENCE
APPLICABILITY_ERROR
POLICY_VIOLATION
```

---

## Non-Conformity

A Non-Conformity occurs when an applicable mandatory requirement is demonstrably not satisfied.

Example:

```text
Requirement:
Official plugin MUST include required metadata.

Observed:
Metadata missing.

State:
NON_CONFORMITY
```

---

## Missing Evidence

Missing evidence is different from confirmed non-conformity.

Example:

```text
Requirement:
Security review required.

Evidence:
Unavailable.

State:
UNKNOWN / INCOMPLETE
```

The system must preserve this distinction.

---

## Compliance Severity

Compliance findings should use the governed FamilyOS severity model.

Conceptually:

```text
CRITICAL
HIGH
MEDIUM
LOW
INFO
```

Severity should reflect risk and governance significance.

---

## Compliance State

A baseline Compliance State model may include:

```text
COMPLIANT
COMPLIANT_WITH_EXCEPTIONS
NON_COMPLIANT
INCOMPLETE
ERROR
NOT_APPLICABLE
```

These states must remain distinct.

---

## COMPLIANT

`COMPLIANT` means:

* all applicable mandatory requirements were evaluated;
* required evidence is valid;
* no unresolved blocking non-conformity exists.

---

## COMPLIANT_WITH_EXCEPTIONS

`COMPLIANT_WITH_EXCEPTIONS` means one or more requirements are covered by valid authorized exceptions.

The underlying non-conformity must remain visible.

---

## NON_COMPLIANT

`NON_COMPLIANT` means at least one applicable mandatory requirement is not satisfied and no valid exception permits conformity.

---

## INCOMPLETE

`INCOMPLETE` means compliance cannot yet be determined because required verification or evidence is missing.

---

## ERROR

`ERROR` means the compliance process itself could not be completed reliably.

Examples include:

```text
Invalid Profile
Broken Rule Configuration
Verification Engine Failure
Corrupted Evidence
```

---

## NOT_APPLICABLE

`NOT_APPLICABLE` applies when a compliance profile or requirement does not apply to the target.

---

## Unknown Is Not Compliant

A central compliance rule is:

> Absence of evidence is not evidence of compliance.

Conceptually:

```text
UNKNOWN
      ≠
COMPLIANT
```

This prevents false confidence.

---

## Compliance Assessment

A Compliance Assessment aggregates requirement-level results into a target-level compliance state.

Conceptually:

```text
Target
      ↓
Applicable Profile
      ↓
Requirements
      ↓
Verification
      ↓
Evidence
      ↓
Requirement Results
      ↓
Compliance Assessment
```

---

## Assessment Identity

A formal assessment should have a stable identity.

Conceptually:

```text
QLT-COMP-ASSESS-<IDENTIFIER>
```

---

## Assessment Metadata

A compliance assessment may contain:

```text
assessment_id
target
revision
profile
profile_version
requirements_evaluated
evidence
findings
exceptions
state
timestamp
```

---

## Requirement Result

Each requirement should produce a structured result.

Example:

```text
Requirement:
QLT-REQ-TEST-004

Applicability:
APPLICABLE

Verification:
PASS

Evidence:
QLT-EVID-723A

Compliance:
COMPLIANT
```

---

## Assessment Aggregation

Compliance aggregation must preserve mandatory semantics.

Example:

```text
Requirement A    COMPLIANT
Requirement B    COMPLIANT
Requirement C    NON_COMPLIANT
Requirement D    COMPLIANT
```

Overall:

```text
NON_COMPLIANT
```

if Requirement C is mandatory and blocking.

---

## No Blind Compliance Score

Compliance must not be represented solely as:

```text
97% compliant
```

because the missing 3% may contain a Critical mandatory requirement.

Percentages may supplement but never replace authoritative compliance state.

---

## Domain Compliance State

Compliance may be summarized by domain.

Example:

```text
Architecture      COMPLIANT
Testing           COMPLIANT
Security          NON_COMPLIANT
Documentation     COMPLIANT
```

Overall compliance must preserve blocking domain failures.

---

## Compliance Matrix

A compliance matrix provides structured traceability.

Example:

| Requirement      | Domain        | Applicable | Evidence     | State         |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ---------: | ------------ | ------------- |
| QLT-REQ-ARCH-001 | Architecture  |        Yes | QLT-EVID-A01 | COMPLIANT     |
| QLT-REQ-TEST-004 | Testing       |        Yes | QLT-EVID-T14 | COMPLIANT     |
| QLT-REQ-DOC-003  | Documentation |        Yes | QLT-EVID-D09 | COMPLIANT     |
| QLT-REQ-SEC-002  | Security      |        Yes | QLT-EVID-S03 | NON_COMPLIANT |

The matrix provides direct requirement-to-evidence traceability.

---

## Compliance Traceability

The complete traceability chain should be:

```text
Authority
      ↓
Requirement
      ↓
Rule
      ↓
Verification
      ↓
Evidence
      ↓
Finding
      ↓
Assessment
      ↓
Compliance State
      ↓
Gate Decision
```

This is one of the most important properties of the Quality Compliance model.

---

## Bidirectional Traceability

Traceability should work in both directions.

From requirement:

```text
Requirement
      ↓
Which rules verify it?
Which evidence supports it?
Which targets comply?
```

From finding:

```text
Finding
      ↓
Which requirement failed?
Which authority defined it?
```

---

## Compliance Exceptions

A Compliance Exception temporarily authorizes deviation from a requirement under controlled conditions.

An exception should include:

```text
Requirement
Target
Scope
Reason
Risk
Authority
Conditions
Expiration
Owner
```

---

## Exception Principle

An exception does not mean the requirement is satisfied.

Conceptually:

```text
Requirement:
NOT SATISFIED

Exception:
VALID

Compliance State:
COMPLIANT_WITH_EXCEPTIONS
```

The underlying condition remains visible.

---

## Exception Scope

Exceptions must be narrowly scoped.

Poor:

```text
Ignore architecture rules.
```

Better:

```text
QLT-REQ-ARCH-004
may be temporarily violated by component X
until migration Y is completed.
```

---

## Exception Expiration

Exceptions should normally expire.

Example:

```text
Valid Until:
v5.2.0
```

or:

```text
Valid Until:
2026-12-31
```

Expired exceptions must no longer affect compliance state.

---

## Exception Renewal

Renewal should require explicit reassessment.

Automatic indefinite renewal undermines governance.

---

## Exception Ownership

Every active exception should have an accountable owner.

Unowned exceptions should trigger governance review.

---

## Exception Risk

The exception should identify accepted residual risk.

Example:

```text
Requirement:
Dependency isolation

Deviation:
Temporary direct dependency

Risk:
MEDIUM

Mitigation:
Migration scheduled before v5.2
```

---

## Compliance Baseline

Legacy systems may require a compliance baseline.

A baseline records known existing non-conformities.

Conceptually:

```text
Existing Non-Conformities
      ↓
Baseline
      ↓
New Non-Conformities Blocked
```

This supports incremental migration.

---

## Baseline Principle

A baseline is not compliance.

It is controlled recognition of existing debt.

---

## Baseline Growth

New non-conformities must not silently enter the baseline.

Example:

```text
Baseline:
12 known violations

Current:
13 violations

New:
1

Result:
Regression
```

The new violation should be evaluated independently.

---

## Baseline Reduction

Compliance improvement should progressively reduce baseline violations.

Example:

```text
Release 1    12
Release 2     9
Release 3     6
Release 4     2
Release 5     0
```

---

## Compliance Debt

Long-lived non-conformity may become Quality Debt.

Examples include:

* legacy architecture violation;
* missing documentation;
* outdated dependency;
* incomplete automated verification.

Compliance Debt should remain visible and governed.

---

## Compliance Regression

A Compliance Regression occurs when a previously satisfied requirement becomes unsatisfied.

Conceptually:

```text
Previous:
COMPLIANT

Current:
NON_COMPLIANT
```

Regression should be detected automatically where possible.

---

## New Requirement vs Regression

A target may become non-compliant because:

```text
Implementation Regressed
```

or because:

```text
Compliance Requirements Changed
```

These causes must remain distinguishable.

---

## Compliance Versioning

Compliance depends on versioned requirements and profiles.

A historical statement should identify:

```text
Target Revision
Compliance Profile
Profile Version
Requirement Versions
Assessment Time
```

---

## Requirement Evolution

Requirements may evolve because of:

* architecture changes;
* new security expectations;
* framework maturity;
* tooling changes;
* regulatory needs;
* operational lessons.

Changes should follow controlled governance.

---

## Requirement Lifecycle

A requirement may move through:

```text
PROPOSED
      ↓
APPROVED
      ↓
ACTIVE
      ↓
DEPRECATED
      ↓
RETIRED
```

Historical assessments should preserve the requirement state applicable at the time.

---

## Compliance Profile Evolution

Profile changes may add or remove requirements.

A new profile version should not silently rewrite historical compliance results.

---

## Compliance Migration

When stricter requirements are introduced, migration may use:

```text
Observe
      ↓
Warn
      ↓
Enforce
```

This mirrors controlled Quality Gate rollout.

---

## Observe Phase

During observation:

* requirements are evaluated;
* findings are recorded;
* progression is not yet blocked.

This allows impact analysis.

---

## Warning Phase

During warning:

* non-conformity is visible;
* remediation is expected;
* enforcement date may be announced.

---

## Enforcement Phase

During enforcement:

* mandatory requirements affect authoritative compliance;
* blocking non-conformity may prevent progression.

---

## Compliance Automation

Compliance should be automated wherever practical.

A conceptual flow is:

```text
Target
      ↓
Resolve Profile
      ↓
Resolve Requirements
      ↓
Determine Applicability
      ↓
Execute Rules
      ↓
Collect Evidence
      ↓
Create Findings
      ↓
Aggregate Compliance
      ↓
Generate Report
```

---

## Compliance Engine

A future Quality Compliance Engine may conceptually provide:

```text
evaluate(target, profile)
      ↓
ComplianceAssessment
```

The engine should remain independent from individual CI providers.

---

## Deterministic Compliance

Where rules are deterministic:

```text
Same Target
+
Same Profile
+
Same Rules
+
Same Evidence
      ↓
Same Compliance State
```

This supports reproducibility.

---

## Compliance Caching

Compliance results may be cached when:

```text
Target Revision Unchanged
Profile Unchanged
Rules Unchanged
Evidence Valid
```

---

## Compliance Invalidation

Cached compliance should be invalidated when:

* target changes;
* profile changes;
* requirement changes;
* rule changes;
* relevant evidence expires;
* exception expires.

---

## Incremental Compliance

Large repositories may support incremental compliance verification.

Example:

```text
Changed Plugin
      ↓
Plugin-Specific Rules
      +
Affected Architecture Rules
      +
Required Repository Rules
```

Incremental evaluation must not omit affected cross-cutting requirements.

---

## Full Compliance Assessment

Full assessment should remain available for important boundaries such as:

* release;
* major architecture change;
* compliance audit;
* official plugin certification.

---

## Compliance Reporting

Every formal assessment should produce a Compliance Report.

A report may contain:

```text
Target
Revision
Profile
Profile Version
Compliance State
Requirements Evaluated
Compliant Requirements
Non-Compliant Requirements
Missing Evidence
Exceptions
Findings
Timestamp
```

---

## Human-Readable Report

A human-readable report should answer:

```text
What was evaluated?

Which requirements apply?

Which requirements failed?

Why?

Which evidence supports the decision?

Which exceptions exist?

What must be remediated?
```

---

## Machine-Readable Report

A machine-readable report should support:

* CI;
* dashboards;
* Quality Gates;
* automation;
* historical analysis.

---

## Compliance Summary

Example:

```text
FamilyOS Compliance Assessment

Target:
Communication Plugin

Profile:
official-plugin

Revision:
abc123

Requirements:
48

Compliant:
46

Non-Compliant:
1

Exception:
1

Missing Evidence:
0

Overall:
COMPLIANT_WITH_EXCEPTIONS
```

---

## Detailed Finding Report

Example:

```text
Requirement:
QLT-REQ-ARCH-009

State:
NON_COMPLIANT

Severity:
HIGH

Evidence:
QLT-EVID-18BC

Finding:
Direct dependency on internal core implementation.

Exception:
QLT-EXC-004

Exception Valid Until:
v5.1.0
```

---

## Compliance Observability

Quality Observability should expose:

```text
Compliance State
Compliance Trend
Non-Conformities
Exceptions
Missing Evidence
Requirement Coverage
Compliance Regressions
```

---

## Compliance Trend

A trend may show:

```text
Release 4.0    NON_COMPLIANT
Release 4.1    COMPLIANT_WITH_EXCEPTIONS
Release 4.2    COMPLIANT_WITH_EXCEPTIONS
Release 4.3    COMPLIANT
```

This demonstrates progress.

---

## Requirement Coverage

Requirement Coverage may measure how many applicable requirements have valid verification.

Conceptually:

```text
Verified Applicable Requirements
/
Applicable Requirements
```

Coverage is useful only when critical missing requirements remain individually visible.

---

## Compliance Dashboard

A dashboard may display:

```text
FamilyOS Compliance

Overall:
COMPLIANT_WITH_EXCEPTIONS

Architecture:
COMPLIANT

Testing:
COMPLIANT

Security:
COMPLIANT

Documentation:
COMPLIANT

Plugin:
COMPLIANT_WITH_EXCEPTIONS

Active Exceptions:
1

Expired Exceptions:
0

Missing Evidence:
0
```

---

## Compliance Alerts

Alerts may be appropriate for:

```text
Critical Non-Conformity
Compliance Regression
Expired Exception
Missing Critical Evidence
Compliance Engine Failure
```

Alerting should remain actionable.

---

## Compliance Metrics

Potential metrics include:

```text
Compliance Assessments
Non-Conformity Count
Compliance Regression Count
Exception Count
Exception Age
Missing Evidence Count
Assessment Duration
Automation Error Rate
```

---

## Compliance Rate

A compliance rate may supplement reporting:

```text
Compliant Requirements
/
Applicable Requirements
```

It must never replace authoritative compliance state.

---

## Exception Rate

A growing exception rate may indicate:

* unrealistic requirements;
* excessive technical debt;
* governance weakness;
* insufficient migration planning.

This should trigger review.

---

## Compliance Failure Rate

Repeated failure of the same requirement may indicate systemic problems.

Example:

```text
QLT-REQ-DOC-004
failed across 17 plugins.
```

The solution may require framework-level improvement rather than individual remediation.

---

## Compliance Ownership

Every compliance domain should have clear ownership.

Ownership may include responsibility for:

```text
Requirements
Rules
Profiles
Verification Methods
Exceptions
Governance
Evolution
```

---

## Requirement Ownership

Each requirement should have an accountable authority or domain owner.

Orphaned requirements should not remain permanently authoritative.

---

## Compliance Review

Compliance requirements and profiles should be reviewed periodically.

Review questions include:

```text
Are requirements still necessary?

Are requirements clear?

Can more requirements be automated?

Are rules producing false positives?

Are exceptions increasing?

Are requirements aligned with architecture?

Are important quality risks uncovered?
```

---

## Compliance Audit

A Compliance Audit verifies both target conformity and the integrity of the compliance process.

Potential audit scope includes:

```text
Requirement Authority
Profile Resolution
Rule Execution
Evidence Integrity
Exception Validity
Assessment Accuracy
Gate Integration
Historical Traceability
```

---

## Internal Compliance Audit

FamilyOS may perform periodic internal audits of:

* official plugins;
* release processes;
* normative documentation;
* engineering frameworks.

The objective is continuous assurance, not bureaucratic certification.

---

## External Compliance

Future FamilyOS deployments may need to satisfy external standards or regulations.

The internal compliance model should therefore support mapping external requirements into FamilyOS requirements without making the core framework dependent on one external standard.

Conceptually:

```text
External Requirement
      ↓
FamilyOS Requirement Mapping
      ↓
Compliance Rule
      ↓
Evidence
```

---

## External Requirement Mapping

An external requirement may map to:

```text
One FamilyOS Requirement
Multiple FamilyOS Requirements
Existing Evidence
Additional Verification
```

Mappings should be explicit.

---

## Regulatory Compliance

If regulatory requirements become applicable, they should be handled through dedicated compliance profiles.

Regulatory interpretation should remain under appropriate legal and governance authority.

---

## Compliance Certification

A future FamilyOS capability may produce formal internal certification records for specific target/profile combinations.

Example:

```text
Target:
Official Communication Plugin

Profile:
official-plugin-v3

Assessment:
COMPLIANT

Revision:
abc123
```

Certification should always remain revision-bound.

---

## Certification Expiration

Certification may become invalid when:

* target changes;
* profile changes materially;
* required evidence expires;
* a significant new finding appears.

---

## Compliance and Quality Gates

Compliance State may become a Quality Gate input.

Example:

```text
Official Plugin Compliance:
NON_COMPLIANT
      ↓
Plugin Gate:
FAIL
```

The gate remains responsible for progression policy.

---

## Compliance and Risk

Compliance and risk are related but not identical.

A target may be:

```text
COMPLIANT
```

while still containing accepted operational risk.

A target may also be:

```text
NON_COMPLIANT
```

for a lower-risk governance requirement.

Both dimensions should remain visible.

---

## Risk-Based Compliance

Risk may influence:

* requirement severity;
* verification depth;
* evidence requirements;
* profile selection;
* remediation urgency.

Risk should not silently redefine mandatory requirements.

---

## Compliance and Quality Debt

Known non-conformity may create Quality Debt when temporarily tolerated.

The relationship is:

```text
Non-Conformity
      ↓
Authorized Temporary Acceptance
      ↓
Quality Debt
      ↓
Remediation
```

---

## Compliance and Defects

A compliance failure may reveal a defect.

Example:

```text
Requirement:
Public API must preserve compatibility.

Compliance Check:
FAIL

Result:
Compatibility Defect
```

Not every compliance finding is necessarily a software defect.

---

## Compliance and Architecture

Architecture compliance converts architectural decisions into enforceable quality expectations.

This prevents architecture documentation from becoming purely descriptive.

---

## Compliance and Documentation

Documentation itself is both:

```text
A Compliance Target
```

and:

```text
A Source of Compliance Authority
```

This dual role requires strong versioning and traceability.

---

## Compliance and Testing

Tests may provide evidence for compliance requirements.

However:

```text
Tests PASS
      ≠
Complete Compliance
```

unless the compliance profile consists exclusively of requirements demonstrated by those tests.

---

## Compliance and Security

Security compliance should integrate with security-specific requirements while preserving the Quality Framework's common evidence, assessment, severity, and gate concepts.

---

## Compliance and Build

Build compliance ensures artifacts are produced according to governed engineering requirements.

Build success alone is not sufficient evidence of complete build compliance.

---

## Compliance and Release

Release compliance ensures all release-specific mandatory requirements have been demonstrated before official publication.

Release compliance may be one of the strongest inputs to the Release Gate.

---

## Compliance and Official Plugins

Official plugins require particularly strong compliance because they represent supported FamilyOS capabilities.

A conceptual model is:

```text
Official Plugin
      ↓
Plugin Compliance Profile
      ↓
Architecture Requirements
Capability Requirements
Testing Requirements
Documentation Requirements
Quality Requirements
      ↓
Compliance Assessment
      ↓
Plugin Quality Gate
```

---

## Compliance and Governance

Quality Governance determines:

```text
Which Requirements Are Mandatory
Which Profiles Exist
Who Owns Requirements
Who Approves Exceptions
How Requirements Change
How Compliance Is Audited
```

Compliance operationalizes these governance decisions.

---

## Compliance and Continuous Improvement

Compliance data provides important feedback.

A continuous improvement loop is:

```text
Requirements
      ↓
Compliance Assessment
      ↓
Non-Conformities
      ↓
Trend Analysis
      ↓
Root Cause Analysis
      ↓
Framework Improvement
      ↓
Improved Requirements and Automation
```

---

## Requirement Effectiveness

A requirement should be reviewed when it:

* repeatedly produces false positives;
* creates no meaningful quality benefit;
* cannot be interpreted consistently;
* duplicates another requirement;
* fails to prevent known problems.

Requirements themselves are subject to quality improvement.

---

## Compliance Automation Effectiveness

Automation should be evaluated for:

```text
Reliability
Accuracy
Execution Cost
False Positive Rate
False Negative Risk
Feedback Latency
```

---

## Compliance Anti-Patterns

The FamilyOS Quality Framework rejects several compliance anti-patterns.

### Checkbox Compliance

Passing a checklist without meaningful evidence does not establish compliance.

### Compliance by Declaration

Statements such as:

```text
This component follows FamilyOS standards.
```

are not sufficient evidence.

### Percentage-Only Compliance

A high percentage must not hide critical mandatory failures.

### Unknown Equals Compliant

Missing evidence must not become approval.

### Permanent Exceptions

Exceptions must not become invisible permanent policy.

### Untraceable Requirements

Requirements must identify their authority.

### Manual Everything

Deterministic requirements should be automated where practical.

### Automation Without Governance

Automated rules must still derive from governed requirements.

### Compliance After Development

Compliance should be integrated into engineering workflows rather than performed only before release.

### Compliance Without Versioning

Historical conformity must be interpretable against the requirements that existed at the time.

---

## Initial Compliance Model

An initial FamilyOS implementation may use:

```text
ComplianceProfile
ComplianceRequirement
ComplianceRule
ComplianceResult
ComplianceAssessment
```

with basic states:

```text
COMPLIANT
NON_COMPLIANT
INCOMPLETE
ERROR
```

---

## Initial Requirements

Initial compliance requirements should focus on existing deterministic engineering expectations.

Examples include:

```text
Ruff PASS
MyPy PASS
Pytest PASS
Required Files Present
Required Metadata Valid
Repository Structure Valid
Plugin Metadata Valid
Documentation Structure Valid
```

---

## Initial Profile

A first general engineering profile may conceptually contain:

```text
familyos-engineering-v1

Code Quality
Testing
Repository Structure
Documentation
Basic Architecture Validation
```

---

## Initial Compliance Flow

```text
Target
      ↓
Resolve Compliance Profile
      ↓
Load Requirements
      ↓
Evaluate Applicability
      ↓
Run Automated Rules
      ↓
Collect Evidence
      ↓
Generate Findings
      ↓
Aggregate Requirement Results
      ↓
Generate Compliance Assessment
      ↓
Quality Gate
```

---

## Initial CLI

A future CLI may conceptually support:

```text
familyos quality compliance check

familyos quality compliance status

familyos quality compliance report
```

Example:

```text
$ familyos quality compliance check

Profile:
familyos-engineering-v1

Requirements:
24

Compliant:
24

Non-Compliant:
0

Missing Evidence:
0

Result:
COMPLIANT
```

---

## Initial Machine-Readable Result

A machine-readable result may conceptually contain:

```text
target
revision
profile
requirements
findings
evidence
state
```

This enables CI integration.

---

## Compliance Maturity Model

Quality Compliance may mature through:

```text
Level 1
Informal Engineering Expectations

    ↓

Level 2
Documented Requirements

    ↓

Level 3
Structured Compliance Profiles

    ↓

Level 4
Automated Compliance Verification

    ↓

Level 5
Evidence-Based Compliance Assessments

    ↓

Level 6
Gate-Integrated Compliance Governance

    ↓

Level 7
Continuous Compliance Intelligence
```

---

## Continuous Compliance

At higher maturity, compliance becomes continuous.

Conceptually:

```text
Engineering Change
      ↓
Automatic Compliance Evaluation
      ↓
Immediate Findings
      ↓
Remediation
      ↓
Updated Compliance State
```

This is preferable to periodic large-scale compliance exercises.

---

## Compliance as Code

Deterministic compliance requirements should increasingly be represented as version-controlled policy and executable rules.

Conceptually:

```text
Requirement
      ↓
Version-Controlled Rule
      ↓
Automated Evaluation
```

This approach may be described as Compliance as Code.

---

## Compliance as Code Principle

Compliance as Code does not mean every compliance decision must be automated.

It means machine-verifiable requirements should be:

* explicit;
* version-controlled;
* reproducible;
* testable.

Human judgment remains necessary where appropriate.

---

## Policy Testing

Compliance rules and profiles should themselves be tested.

Examples include:

```text
Known Compliant Target
      → COMPLIANT

Known Invalid Target
      → NON_COMPLIANT

Missing Evidence
      → INCOMPLETE

Expired Exception
      → NON_COMPLIANT
```

---

## Compliance Framework Testing

The compliance engine should have:

* unit tests;
* integration tests;
* rule tests;
* profile resolution tests;
* evidence validation tests;
* exception tests;
* regression tests.

---

## Rule False Positive Testing

Rules should include fixtures demonstrating legitimate patterns that must pass.

This reduces unnecessary developer friction.

---

## Rule False Negative Testing

Rules should include known invalid fixtures that must fail.

This ensures enforcement remains effective.

---

## Compliance Observability Integration

Every compliance assessment should contribute structured telemetry.

Potential events include:

```text
quality.compliance.completed
quality.compliance.failed
quality.compliance.regression
quality.compliance.exception.expired
```

---

## Compliance Event

A compliance event may include:

```text
target
revision
profile
state
findings
timestamp
```

---

## Compliance History

Historical compliance should support questions such as:

```text
When did this component become compliant?

Which requirement caused the last regression?

How long has this exception existed?

Which requirements fail most often?
```

---

## Compliance Query Model

Future tooling may support:

```text
Show all non-compliant official plugins.

Show requirements with active exceptions.

Show compliance regressions this release.

Show requirements missing evidence.

Show expired exceptions.

Show requirements failing across multiple targets.
```

---

## Compliance Intelligence

At advanced maturity, FamilyOS may derive insights from compliance history.

Examples include:

```text
Requirements frequently violated together
Domains with growing compliance debt
Rules producing excessive false positives
Requirements correlated with escaped defects
```

These insights may improve the framework.

---

## AI-Assisted Compliance

AI may assist with:

* explaining requirements;
* summarizing compliance reports;
* mapping findings to likely remediation;
* identifying related requirements;
* analyzing historical compliance trends.

---

## AI Compliance Restrictions

AI must not independently:

```text
Declare Mandatory Compliance
Approve Exceptions
Change Requirement Authority
Override Compliance Gates
Accept Critical Risk
```

unless future governance explicitly establishes an authoritative mechanism.

AI-generated conclusions must remain distinguishable from authoritative compliance results.

---

## Compliance Security

Compliance infrastructure is part of the FamilyOS Quality Control Plane.

It must be protected against:

* unauthorized rule modification;
* evidence tampering;
* profile manipulation;
* exception forgery;
* assessment alteration.

---

## Compliance Integrity

Authoritative compliance results should bind:

```text
Target
Revision
Profile
Profile Version
Requirement Set
Evidence
Assessment
```

This protects interpretation.

---

## Compliance Provenance

A compliance result should answer:

```text
What was evaluated?

Against which requirements?

Which versions?

Using which evidence?

Who or what verified it?

Which exceptions were active?

When was the assessment produced?
```

---

## Compliance Immutability

Published formal assessments should remain immutable where practical.

A changed target should produce a new assessment rather than rewriting historical results.

---

## Compliance Retention

Retention should be proportional to lifecycle significance.

Examples:

```text
Developer Compliance Check
      → short-lived

Official Plugin Certification
      → longer-lived

Release Compliance Assessment
      → release-history retention
```

---

## Compliance Scalability

The model must scale as FamilyOS grows across:

```text
More Requirements
More Plugins
More Repositories
More Profiles
More Releases
More Evidence
```

Profiles and reusable rules are essential for scalability.

---

## Requirement Reuse

Common requirements should be reusable across profiles.

Example:

```text
Python Quality Requirements
      ↓
Core Profile
Plugin Profile
CLI Profile
```

This prevents duplicated policy.

---

## Domain Ownership Scalability

Different domain authorities may maintain their own requirements while sharing the common compliance model.

Example:

```text
Security
      ↓
Security Requirements

Documentation
      ↓
Documentation Requirements

Testing
      ↓
Testing Requirements

All
      ↓
Common Compliance Engine
```

---

## Federated Compliance Model

FamilyOS may eventually use a federated model where domain frameworks define their own requirements while the Quality Framework provides:

```text
Common Requirement Model
Common Evidence Model
Common Assessment Model
Common Severity Model
Common Reporting Model
Common Gate Integration
```

This avoids centralizing every domain rule inside one framework.

---

## Relationship With Plugin Compliance Framework

The Plugin Compliance Framework is a specialized implementation of compliance concepts for FamilyOS plugins.

The Quality Compliance model provides common platform-level semantics.

The Plugin Compliance Framework provides plugin-specific:

* domains;
* requirements;
* profiles;
* rules;
* evidence;
* findings;
* reporting.

---

## Relationship With Quality Metrics

Compliance metrics provide quantitative visibility into conformity.

Metrics do not replace requirement-level evidence.

---

## Relationship With Quality Evidence

Quality Evidence is the factual basis for compliance.

The relationship is:

```text
Requirement
      ↓
Verification
      ↓
Evidence
      ↓
Compliance Result
```

---

## Relationship With Quality Risk

Risk determines the significance of compliance failures and may influence enforcement policy.

Compliance state and risk state must remain separate.

---

## Relationship With Defect and Quality Debt Management

Non-conformities may produce:

```text
Defects
Quality Debt
Risks
```

depending on their nature and lifecycle.

---

## Relationship With Quality Reviews and Assessments

Compliance Assessment is a specialized assessment focused on conformity with explicit requirements.

Broader Quality Assessments may include compliance state as one dimension.

---

## Relationship With Quality Automation

Quality Automation executes machine-verifiable compliance rules and collects evidence.

---

## Relationship With Quality Observability

Quality Observability exposes compliance state, trends, exceptions, regressions, and infrastructure health.

---

## Relationship With Quality Gates

Quality Gates consume compliance state when policy requires conformity before progression.

The relationship is:

```text
Compliance Assessment
      ↓
Compliance State
      ↓
Gate Policy
      ↓
Progression Decision
```

---

## Relationship With Quality Governance

Quality Governance determines:

```text
Requirement Authority
Profile Authority
Exception Authority
Compliance Ownership
Audit Policy
Evolution Policy
```

Compliance operationalizes these decisions.

---

## Reference Compliance Flow

The complete FamilyOS Quality Compliance flow can be represented as:

```text
Authoritative Engineering Decisions
      ↓
Normative Requirements
      ↓
Compliance Requirement Registry
      ↓

```

---

## Strategic Outcome

Quality Compliance enables FamilyOS to move from:

```text
We believe this component follows the standards.

The tests pass.

The architecture looks correct.

The documentation seems complete.
```

toward:

```text
This target has been evaluated against a defined,
versioned FamilyOS Compliance Profile.

Every applicable mandatory requirement is traceable
to an authoritative source.

Required verification has been performed.

Evidence is complete, valid, and revision-bound.

Any non-conformity, exception, or missing evidence
is explicitly represented.

The resulting compliance state is reproducible,
auditable, observable, and enforceable through
Quality Gates.
```

This provides substantially stronger engineering assurance.

---

## Final Quality Compliance Principle

Quality standards become meaningful only when conformity can be demonstrated consistently.

FamilyOS therefore requires a compliance model that connects normative engineering expectations with explicit requirements, executable rules, valid evidence, structured assessments, controlled exceptions, and enforceable progression decisions.

The Quality Compliance model establishes the relationship:

```text
Authority
      ↓
Requirement
      ↓
Applicability
      ↓
Verification
      ↓
Evidence
      ↓
Compliance Assessment
      ↓
Compliance State
      ↓
Quality Gate
      ↓
Engineering Progression
```

Through requirement provenance, compliance profiles, deterministic verification, structured evidence, multidimensional assessment, exception governance, baseline management, continuous compliance, observability, automation, versioning, and traceability, Quality Compliance ensures that FamilyOS quality expectations evolve from documented intentions into demonstrable and governable engineering reality.
