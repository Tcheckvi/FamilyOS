# Quality Framework

## 23 Summary

### Overview

EPIC-QLT-001 — Quality Framework establishes the quality engineering foundation of FamilyOS.

The framework defines how quality is understood, structured, measured, verified, evidenced, assessed, automated, observed, governed, enforced, and continuously improved across the complete FamilyOS engineering lifecycle.

It transforms quality from a collection of independent engineering practices into an integrated platform capability.

The complete model is:

```text
Engineering Intent
      ↓
Quality Requirements
      ↓
Quality Rules
      ↓
Verification
      ↓
Quality Evidence
      ↓
Quality Findings
      ↓
Quality Metrics
      ↓
Quality Risk
      ↓
Quality Assessment
      ↓
Quality Gates
      ↓
Engineering Decisions
      ↓
Quality Observability
      ↓
Continuous Improvement
      ↓
Quality Governance
```

The framework is designed to support both present engineering needs and the long-term evolution of the FamilyOS platform.

---

## Framework Purpose

The primary purpose of EPIC-QLT-001 is to ensure that FamilyOS quality becomes:

* explicit;
* measurable;
* verifiable;
* traceable;
* repeatable;
* automatable;
* observable;
* risk-aware;
* governable;
* continuously improvable.

The framework does not define quality as a final inspection phase.

Quality is treated as a permanent engineering responsibility.

---

## Quality Philosophy

FamilyOS quality is based on the principle that engineering confidence must be justified by evidence.

The framework rejects the idea that quality can be established through statements such as:

```text
The code looks good.

The tests passed.

The architecture seems correct.

The release should be safe.
```

Instead, FamilyOS moves toward:

```text
The applicable quality requirements are known.

Required verification has executed.

Evidence is available.

Findings are understood.

Risks are evaluated.

The quality state is explicit.

Progression policy has been applied.
```

This creates explainable engineering confidence.

---

## Quality as an Engineering Capability

The Quality Framework treats quality as a cross-cutting engineering capability spanning:

```text
Architecture
Code
Testing
Documentation
Dependencies
Build
Release
Security
Plugins
Configuration
Infrastructure
Governance
Operations
```

Quality therefore cannot be owned by one tool or one lifecycle phase.

---

## Quality Architecture

The framework establishes a layered quality architecture.

Conceptually:

```text
Quality Governance
      ↓
Quality Policy
      ↓
Quality Requirements
      ↓
Quality Profiles
      ↓
Quality Rules
      ↓
Quality Checks
      ↓
Quality Evidence
      ↓
Quality Findings
      ↓
Quality Assessments
      ↓
Quality Gates
```

Supporting capabilities include:

```text
Metrics
Risk
Quality Debt
Automation
Observability
Compliance
Continuous Improvement
```

---

## Quality Requirements

Quality Requirements define the authoritative expectations that FamilyOS engineering targets must satisfy.

Requirements should identify:

```text
Identity
Authority
Applicability
Expectation
Verification
Evidence
Severity
Lifecycle
```

Requirements create the bridge between engineering intent and enforceable quality behavior.

---

## Quality Rules

Quality Rules operationalize requirements.

A rule translates a quality expectation into a form that can be:

* automatically verified;
* manually reviewed;
* assessed;
* reported;
* enforced.

The relationship is:

```text
Requirement
      ↓
Rule
      ↓
Check
      ↓
Evidence
```

Rules remain subordinate to authoritative requirements.

---

## Quality Profiles

Quality Profiles define which requirements apply to specific target categories.

Profiles enable differentiated assurance.

Examples may include:

```text
Repository
Official Plugin
Documentation
Release
Critical Component
Security-Sensitive Component
```

Profiles avoid applying every possible requirement to every engineering target.

---

## Quality Metrics

Quality Metrics provide quantitative visibility into engineering quality.

Metrics may describe:

```text
Defects
Findings
Testing
Quality Debt
Risk
Automation
Gate Behavior
Compliance
Performance
```

Metrics are intended to support decisions.

They are not themselves proof of quality.

---

## Quality Evidence

Quality Evidence provides the factual foundation of the framework.

Evidence records what was evaluated, how it was evaluated, and what was observed.

Conceptually:

```text
Target
+
Rule
+
Verification
+
Result
+
Context
+
Revision
+
Timestamp
=
Quality Evidence
```

Evidence enables reproducibility, traceability, assessments, governance, and historical reconstruction.

---

## Quality Findings

Quality Findings represent observed quality conditions requiring attention or interpretation.

Findings should remain structured and traceable to:

```text
Target
Rule
Evidence
Severity
Domain
```

Findings may become:

* defects;
* risks;
* Quality Debt;
* warnings;
* gate-blocking conditions.

---

## Quality Risk

Quality Risk evaluates the potential consequences associated with quality conditions.

Risk considers:

```text
Likelihood
+
Impact
+
Context
+
Target Criticality
```

This enables FamilyOS to apply quality assurance proportionally.

Higher-risk engineering changes require stronger confidence.

---

## Defect Management

Defect management provides a structured lifecycle for confirmed quality problems.

The expected lifecycle is:

```text
Finding
      ↓
Triage
      ↓
Defect
      ↓
Ownership
      ↓
Remediation
      ↓
Verification
      ↓
Closure
```

Significant defects should contribute to future prevention.

---

## Quality Debt

Quality Debt represents known unresolved quality deficiencies.

It may include:

```text
Architecture Debt
Testing Debt
Security Debt
Documentation Debt
Dependency Debt
Automation Debt
Observability Debt
Governance Debt
```

Debt must remain:

* visible;
* owned;
* risk-assessed;
* prioritized;
* reviewable.

The framework rejects invisible or permanently forgotten debt.

---

## Quality Reviews

Quality Reviews provide structured human evaluation where deterministic automation is insufficient.

Review types may include:

```text
Peer Review
Architecture Review
Security Review
Documentation Review
Risk Review
Release Review
Post-Incident Review
```

Human review complements automation.

It does not replace deterministic verification where automation is possible.

---

## Quality Assessments

Quality Assessments combine distributed quality information into an interpretable target-level state.

An assessment may consume:

```text
Evidence
Findings
Metrics
Risk
Debt
Exceptions
Reviews
Compliance
```

and produce states such as:

```text
PASS
PASS_WITH_WARNINGS
CONDITIONAL
FAIL
UNKNOWN
```

Assessments answer:

```text
What is the current quality state?
```

---

## Quality Automation

Quality Automation converts repeatable quality requirements into executable controls.

The automation model is:

```text
Requirement
      ↓
Rule
      ↓
Executor
      ↓
Raw Result
      ↓
Normalization
      ↓
Evidence
      ↓
Assessment
```

Automation should prioritize:

```text
Determinism
Reliability
Speed
Reproducibility
Actionable Feedback
```

---

## Automation Integration

Quality automation may operate across:

```text
Local Development
Pre-Commit
Pull Request
Continuous Integration
Build
Release
```

The long-term objective is a consistent local and CI quality experience.

---

## Quality Observability

Quality Observability provides continuous visibility into quality state and evolution.

It combines:

```text
Evidence
Findings
Metrics
Risks
Debt
Assessments
Gate Decisions
Automation Health
Operational Signals
```

Observability enables FamilyOS to understand:

```text
Current State
Historical State
Trend
Regression
Risk
Improvement
```

---

## Quality Gates

Quality Gates transform quality state into controlled lifecycle progression decisions.

The relationship is:

```text
Evidence
      ↓
Assessment
      ↓
Quality State
      ↓
Gate Policy
      ↓
Progression Decision
```

Gate outcomes may include:

```text
PASS
FAIL
CONDITIONAL
ERROR
NOT_APPLICABLE
```

Unknown quality state must never silently become PASS.

---

## Compliance

Quality Compliance evaluates whether targets satisfy applicable mandatory FamilyOS requirements.

The compliance chain is:

```text
Authority
      ↓
Requirement
      ↓
Applicability
      ↓
Verification
      ↓
Evidence
      ↓
Compliance Assessment
```

Possible states include:

```text
COMPLIANT
COMPLIANT_WITH_EXCEPTIONS
NON_COMPLIANT
INCOMPLETE
ERROR
```

---

## Compliance Profiles

Compliance Profiles enable different requirements for different target categories.

Examples include:

```text
Base Engineering
Official Plugin
Documentation
Release
Critical Release
```

Domain frameworks may provide specialized compliance semantics.

---

## Exceptions

Exceptions permit controlled temporary deviations from requirements.

An exception must remain:

```text
Explicit
Scoped
Owned
Authorized
Risk-Assessed
Time-Bounded where practical
Traceable
```

An exception does not erase the underlying quality condition.

---

## Overrides

Overrides alter a progression decision under exceptional governance.

An override does not change the underlying quality state.

Conceptually:

```text
Assessment:
FAIL

Gate:
FAIL

Authorized Override:
Progression Allowed

Quality State:
Still FAIL
```

This distinction preserves engineering truth.

---

## Continuous Improvement

Continuous Improvement transforms quality outcomes into engineering learning.

The cycle is:

```text
Observe
      ↓
Measure
      ↓
Analyze
      ↓
Prioritize
      ↓
Improve
      ↓
Validate
      ↓
Standardize
      ↓
Observe Again
```

The objective is not merely to fix defects.

It is to reduce the probability of entire defect classes recurring.

---

## Learning Loop

A mature quality learning loop is:

```text
Defect
      ↓
Root Cause
      ↓
Control Gap
      ↓
New Test / Rule / Architecture / Automation
      ↓
Future Prevention
```

FamilyOS should continuously convert engineering experience into institutional capability.

---

## Quality Governance

Quality Governance defines:

```text
Authority
Ownership
Policy
Decision Rights
Risk Acceptance
Exception Authority
Gate Authority
Lifecycle
Evolution
```

Governance ensures quality decisions remain consistent and traceable.

---

## Governance Model

The governance chain is:

```text
FamilyOS Vision
      ↓
Engineering Constitution
      ↓
Architecture and Engineering Governance
      ↓
Quality Governance
      ↓
Quality Policy
      ↓
Requirements
      ↓
Rules
      ↓
Verification
      ↓
Decisions
```

Lower-level automation must not silently redefine higher-level policy.

---

## Federated Governance

The Quality Framework favors federated governance.

Domain frameworks remain authoritative for their own semantics.

Examples:

```text
Testing Framework
      → Testing Semantics

Documentation Framework
      → Documentation Semantics

Plugin Compliance Framework
      → Plugin Compliance Semantics

Quality Framework
      → Common Quality Integration
```

This prevents semantic duplication.

---

## Quality Framework Lifecycle

The Quality Framework itself has a lifecycle.

The complete model is:

```text
Need
  ↓
Design
  ↓
Review
  ↓
Approval
  ↓
Pilot
  ↓
Observation
  ↓
Warning
  ↓
Enforcement
  ↓
Operation
  ↓
Improvement
  ↓
Evolution
  ↓
Migration
  ↓
Deprecation
  ↓
Retirement
```

Framework capabilities must not remain permanently authoritative without lifecycle governance.

---

## Rule Lifecycle

Quality Rules may evolve through:

```text
PROPOSED
   ↓
EXPERIMENTAL
   ↓
OBSERVE
   ↓
WARN
   ↓
ENFORCE
   ↓
DEPRECATED
   ↓
RETIRED
```

This enables evidence-based enforcement.

---

## Framework Versioning

Framework versions preserve semantic history.

Important quality records should eventually identify:

```text
Framework Version
Profile Version
Rule Version
Target Revision
```

This allows historical assessments and gate decisions to remain interpretable.

---

## Roadmap

The implementation roadmap progresses through:

```text
Framework Foundation
      ↓
Quality Model
      ↓
Deterministic Verification
      ↓
Quality Evidence
      ↓
Quality Assessment
      ↓
Quality Automation
      ↓
Quality Gates
      ↓
Quality Observability
      ↓
Governance Integration
      ↓
Continuous Improvement
      ↓
Quality Intelligence
```

This order intentionally prioritizes deterministic engineering foundations before advanced analytical capabilities.

---

## Initial Implementation Direction

The first implementation should remain small and practical.

Priority capabilities include:

```text
Common Severity Model
Quality Finding Model
Quality Evidence Model
Quality Requirement Model
Quality Assessment Model
Ruff Integration
MyPy Integration
Pytest Integration
Documentation Validation
Plugin Compliance Integration
```

The Quality Framework should normalize existing tools rather than replace them.

---

## Future Quality CLI

A future quality CLI may evolve toward:

```text
familyos quality check
familyos quality assess
familyos quality report
familyos quality findings
familyos quality evidence
familyos quality compliance
familyos quality risk
familyos quality debt
familyos quality gate
```

The exact command model should follow the FamilyOS CLI Architecture.

---

## Future Quality Platform

At greater maturity, the Quality Framework may evolve into an internal Quality Platform.

Conceptually:

```text
                 FamilyOS Quality Platform

┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Quality Domain Model                             │
│ Requirement Registry                             │
│ Rule Engine                                      │
│ Verification Adapters                            │
│ Evidence Model                                   │
│ Finding Management                               │
│ Assessment Engine                                │
│ Compliance Engine                                │
│ Gate Engine                                      │
│ Risk Management                                  │
│ Quality Debt Management                          │
│ Observability                                    │
│ Governance                                       │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                         ↓
                 FamilyOS Engineering
```

This platform should emerge incrementally from proven capabilities.

---

## Quality Intelligence

Advanced quality intelligence should only be introduced after sufficient deterministic evidence and historical data exist.

Potential future capabilities include:

```text
Trend Interpretation
Finding Clustering
Risk Prediction
Regression Detection
Root Cause Assistance
Improvement Recommendations
```

AI should remain explainable and evidence-grounded.

---

## AI Role

AI may assist with:

* summarization;
* investigation;
* correlation;
* explanations;
* recommendations.

AI should not autonomously become the authoritative mechanism for:

```text
Critical Risk Acceptance
Quality Exception Approval
Gate Override
Release Authorization
Mandatory Policy Definition
```

unless future FamilyOS governance explicitly defines such authority.

---

## Validation

The Quality Framework must itself be validated.

Validation includes:

```text
Structural Validation
Content Validation
Semantic Validation
Architecture Validation
Cross-Framework Validation
Reference Validation
Traceability Validation
Implementation Feasibility
Governance Validation
Lifecycle Validation
Roadmap Validation
```

The framework should satisfy the same expectations of evidence and traceability that it introduces for the rest of FamilyOS.

---

## Validation Principle

The authority of the Quality Framework depends on the credibility of the framework itself.

Therefore:

```text
Framework Written
      ≠
Framework Validated
```

and:

```text
Framework Documentation Complete
      ≠
Framework Implementation Complete
```

These states must remain separate.

---

## Cross-Framework Integration

The Quality Framework integrates with major FamilyOS foundations.

Primary relationships include:

```text
Engineering Foundation
Testing Framework
Documentation Framework
Build Framework
Release Framework
Plugin Compliance Framework
Architecture Foundation
Security Architecture
```

The Quality Framework consumes their domain-specific outputs and combines them into broader quality state.

---

## Engineering Foundation Relationship

The Engineering Foundation defines the general FamilyOS engineering philosophy.

The Quality Framework operationalizes quality assurance across that engineering lifecycle.

---

## Testing Framework Relationship

The Testing Framework defines how testing works.

The Quality Framework consumes testing evidence.

```text
Testing Framework
      ↓
Test Evidence
      ↓
Quality Assessment
```

---

## Documentation Framework Relationship

The Documentation Framework defines documentation quality semantics.

The Quality Framework integrates documentation results into broader assessments and gates.

---

## Build Framework Relationship

The Build Framework defines build semantics.

The Quality Framework consumes build evidence and determines quality impact.

---

## Release Framework Relationship

The Release Framework governs release lifecycle.

The Quality Framework provides release quality state and Quality Gates.

---

## Plugin Compliance Framework Relationship

The Plugin Compliance Framework provides specialized compliance for plugins.

The Quality Framework integrates its compliance evidence into broader platform quality.

---

## Architecture Relationship

Architecture decisions may become:

```text
Architecture Principle
      ↓
Quality Requirement
      ↓
Architecture Rule
      ↓
Evidence
      ↓
Assessment
```

This converts architecture from documentation into enforceable engineering structure.

---

## Quality Traceability

One of the framework's most important strategic capabilities is end-to-end quality traceability.

Conceptually:

```text
Engineering Decision
      ↓
Requirement
      ↓
Rule
      ↓
Verification
      ↓
Evidence
      ↓
Finding
      ↓
Risk
      ↓
Assessment
      ↓
Gate
      ↓
Engineering Decision
```

This creates explainable governance.

---

## Quality Control Plane

The Quality Framework forms part of the FamilyOS engineering control plane.

Conceptually:

```text
Quality Governance
      ↓
Quality Policy
      ↓
Rules and Profiles
      ↓
Automation
      ↓
Evidence
      ↓
Assessment
      ↓
Gates
```

The integrity of this control plane is itself a quality and security concern.

---

## Quality and Developer Experience

Quality controls should support engineers rather than create unnecessary friction.

A good quality system provides:

```text
Fast Feedback
Clear Failures
Reproducibility
Actionable Guidance
Consistent Semantics
```

Poor quality tooling encourages bypass behavior and reduces trust.

---

## Quality and Sustainability

The long-term objective is not maximum strictness.

The objective is sustainable engineering confidence.

The framework therefore balances:

```text
Quality Assurance
+
Developer Productivity
+
Risk
+
Maintenance Cost
+
Evolution
```

---

## No Zero-Defect Dogma

FamilyOS does not assume that every quality deficiency must be eliminated immediately.

The more important requirement is:

```text
No Invisible High-Risk Defects

No Unmanaged Critical Risk

No Silent Quality Debt

No Unknown State Presented as PASS
```

This creates realistic but disciplined quality engineering.

---

## No Quality Theatre

The framework rejects quality activities that create appearances without meaningful engineering confidence.

Examples include:

```text
Metrics without decisions.
Reviews without criteria.
Tests without relevant assertions.
Compliance without evidence.
Gates without policy.
Documentation without maintenance.
```

Every quality mechanism should serve an explicit engineering purpose.

---

## Core Quality Principles

The framework can be summarized through several core principles.

```text
Quality is continuous.

Quality is evidence-based.

Quality is multidimensional.

Quality is risk-aware.

Quality should be automated where deterministic.

Quality should remain explainable.

Quality controls must be proportional.

Unknown is not PASS.

Exceptions must remain explicit.

Quality Debt must remain visible.

Quality decisions must be traceable.

Quality policy must be governed.

Quality systems must improve continuously.
```

---

## Current Framework Outcome

At the completion of EPIC-QLT-001 documentation, FamilyOS gains an authoritative conceptual foundation for:

```text
Quality Requirements
Quality Metrics
Quality Evidence
Quality Risk
Defect Management
Quality Debt
Quality Reviews
Quality Assessments
Quality Automation
Quality Observability
Quality Gates
Quality Compliance
Continuous Improvement
Quality Governance
Quality Framework Lifecycle
Quality Roadmap
```

This provides the architecture necessary for future implementation.

---

## Documentation Completion vs Implementation

Completion of the EPIC documentation should be interpreted as:

```text
Quality Architecture Defined
      ↓
Normative Model Established
      ↓
Implementation Direction Established
```

not:

```text
Complete Quality Platform Implemented
```

Implementation follows the roadmap.

---

## Near-Term Engineering Outcome

The near-term target is to establish:

```text
One Quality Vocabulary
One Severity Model
One Finding Model
One Evidence Model
One Assessment Model
One Quality CLI Entry Point
```

integrating existing FamilyOS quality tools.

---

## Medium-Term Engineering Outcome

The medium-term target is:

```text
Automated Quality Assessments
Quality Profiles
CI Integration
Quality Gates
Historical Quality State
Risk and Debt Visibility
Structured Compliance
Governed Exceptions
```

---

## Long-Term Engineering Outcome

The long-term target is:

```text
Continuous Quality Assessment
Integrated Quality Governance
Cross-Framework Quality Observability
Systemic Continuous Improvement
Predictive Quality Intelligence
Explainable AI Assistance
```

---

## Framework Maturity

The full maturity progression can be summarized as:

```text
Level 1
Quality Principles

    ↓

Level 2
Quality Verification

    ↓

Level 3
Quality Evidence

    ↓

Level 4
Quality Assessment

    ↓

Level 5
Quality Automation and Gates

    ↓

Level 6
Quality Observability and Governance

    ↓

Level 7
Continuous Quality Improvement

    ↓

Level 8
Quality Intelligence
```

---

## Strategic Value

EPIC-QLT-001 creates value beyond defect detection.

It provides the foundation for:

* safer architectural evolution;
* stronger plugin governance;
* more reliable releases;
* measurable engineering quality;
* reduced Quality Debt;
* faster feedback;
* improved traceability;
* evidence-based decisions;
* scalable engineering governance.

---

## FamilyOS Quality Vision

The strategic quality vision is:

```text
Every important FamilyOS engineering decision
should eventually be supported by sufficient,
current, explainable quality evidence.
```

This does not mean every decision becomes automated.

It means engineering confidence should become increasingly demonstrable.

---

## Reference Quality System

The complete reference model is:

```text
FamilyOS Vision
      ↓
Engineering Constitution
      ↓
Engineering and Architecture Foundations
      ↓
Quality Governance
      ↓
Quality Policy
      ↓
Quality Requirements
      ↓
Quality Profiles
      ↓
Quality Rules
      ↓
Quality Automation / Reviews
      ↓
Quality Evidence
      ↓
Quality Findings
      ↓
Metrics + Risk + Defects + Quality Debt
      ↓
Quality Assessments
      ↓
Compliance
      ↓
Quality Gates
      ↓
Engineering Progression
      ↓
Operational Outcomes
      ↓
Quality Observability
      ↓
Continuous Improvement
      ↓
Framework Evolution
      ↓
Quality Governance
```

This forms a closed quality engineering system.

---

## Strategic Outcome

The Quality Framework enables FamilyOS to move from:

```text
Quality is something engineers try to maintain
through testing, review, discipline, and experience.
```

toward:

```text
Quality is an explicit FamilyOS engineering capability.

Requirements are defined.

Verification is reproducible.

Evidence is structured.

Findings are traceable.

Risk is explicit.

Quality Debt is visible.

Assessments explain engineering state.

Compliance demonstrates conformity.

Quality Gates protect progression.

Observability reveals trends.

Governance establishes authority.

Continuous Improvement converts experience
into stronger future engineering controls.
```

This is the fundamental transformation introduced by EPIC-QLT-001.

---

## Final Summary Principle

FamilyOS quality must not depend on optimism, memory, isolated tools, or informal approval.

It must progressively become an integrated engineering capability based on:

```text
Intent
   ↓
Requirements
   ↓
Verification
   ↓
Evidence
   ↓
Understanding
   ↓
Decision
   ↓
Learning
```

EPIC-QLT-001 establishes the architecture required to make that progression possible.

The framework provides FamilyOS with a durable foundation for building, evaluating, releasing, governing, and continuously improving an engineering platform whose quality remains explainable as its architecture, capabilities, ecosystem, and lifetime expand.
