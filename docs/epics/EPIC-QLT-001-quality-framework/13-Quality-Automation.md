# Quality Framework

# 13 Quality Automation

## Overview

The FamilyOS Quality Automation model defines how repeatable quality activities are automated across development, testing, integration, build, release, documentation, compliance, and governance workflows.

Quality automation transforms quality requirements from manually remembered engineering expectations into executable, reproducible, and continuously enforceable controls.

The model establishes the relationship:

```text
Quality Requirement
      ↓
Automatable Rule
      ↓
Quality Check
      ↓
Execution
      ↓
Evidence
      ↓
Finding
      ↓
Assessment
      ↓
Quality Gate
```

Automation is not intended to replace engineering judgment.

Its purpose is to automate deterministic and repeatable verification so that engineers can focus human attention on architecture, design, risk, ambiguity, and strategic decisions.

---

# Purpose

The purpose of Quality Automation is to make FamilyOS quality assurance:

* repeatable;
* scalable;
* fast;
* consistent;
* observable;
* evidence-producing;
* enforceable;
* maintainable.

Without automation, quality practices depend excessively on individual memory and manual discipline.

A manual model tends toward:

```text
Engineer
   ↓
Remember Quality Requirement
   ↓
Perform Manual Check
   ↓
Interpret Result
   ↓
Record Evidence
   ↓
Decide
```

This introduces variability.

The target model is:

```text
Engineering Change
      ↓
Automated Quality Pipeline
      ↓
Deterministic Checks
      ↓
Structured Evidence
      ↓
Assessment
      ↓
Engineering Feedback
```

---

# Foundational Principle

The foundational principle is:

> Every deterministic, repeatable, and economically automatable quality requirement should eventually become executable quality control.

This does not imply that every quality decision can be automated.

Human judgment remains essential where evaluation requires:

* architectural reasoning;
* strategic trade-offs;
* contextual risk analysis;
* ambiguous requirements;
* governance authority.

---

# Automation Scope

Quality Automation may apply to:

```text
Source Code
Tests
Architecture
Documentation
Dependencies
Configuration
Build
Packaging
Security
Compliance
Release
Quality Governance
```

Automation should span the complete engineering lifecycle.

---

# Automation Layers

FamilyOS Quality Automation may operate through several layers:

```text
Developer Environment
      ↓
Local Validation
      ↓
Pre-Commit Validation
      ↓
Pull Request Validation
      ↓
Continuous Integration
      ↓
Build Validation
      ↓
Release Validation
      ↓
Post-Release Validation
```

Different layers optimize for different feedback requirements.

---

# Automation Architecture

A conceptual architecture is:

```text
Quality Requirements
        ↓
Quality Rules
        ↓
Automation Adapters
        ↓
Quality Tools
        ↓
Raw Results
        ↓
Evidence Normalization
        ↓
Quality Evidence
        ↓
Findings
        ↓
Assessment Engine
        ↓
Quality Gates
```

This separates policy from tooling.

---

# Policy and Tool Separation

Quality policy must not depend directly on a specific tool.

For example:

```text
Policy:
Python source must satisfy configured linting requirements.

Implementation:
Ruff
```

The tool may change.

The requirement remains.

Therefore:

```text
Quality Requirement
      ≠
Tool Configuration
```

Tools implement policy.

They do not define the complete Quality Framework.

---

# Automation Rule

An Automation Rule represents an executable quality expectation.

A conceptual rule may contain:

```text
id
domain
description
severity
profile
executor
configuration
evidence_type
failure_behavior
```

Example:

```text
id:
QLT-RULE-CODE-001

description:
Python source must satisfy configured linting rules.

executor:
ruff
```

---

# Automation Identity

Automated checks should have stable identities independent of temporary command names.

For example:

```text
QLT-CHECK-LINT
QLT-CHECK-TYPE
QLT-CHECK-UNIT
QLT-CHECK-ARCH
QLT-CHECK-DOC
```

Stable identity enables:

* reporting;
* historical comparison;
* evidence correlation;
* observability;
* governance.

---

# Automation Executor

An executor performs a quality check.

Examples include:

```text
Ruff
MyPy
Pytest
Documentation Validator
Architecture Validator
Compliance Validator
Dependency Scanner
Build Validator
```

The Quality Framework should interact with executors through normalized interfaces where practical.

---

# Executor Contract

A conceptual executor contract may be:

```text
QualityExecutor
      ↓
prepare()
execute()
collect()
normalize()
```

The exact implementation may differ.

The important principle is separation between execution and quality interpretation.

---

# Executor Input

An executor may receive:

```text
Target
Quality Profile
Rule Configuration
Execution Context
Repository Revision
Environment Information
```

Inputs should be explicit enough to reproduce execution.

---

# Executor Output

Raw executor output may contain:

```text
Exit Code
Standard Output
Standard Error
Reports
Metrics
Artifacts
Timing
```

Raw output should not automatically become authoritative Quality Evidence.

---

# Result Normalization

Different tools produce different result formats.

The Quality Automation layer should normalize them.

Conceptually:

```text
Ruff JSON
MyPy Output
Pytest XML
Custom Validator JSON
      ↓
Normalization
      ↓
FamilyOS Quality Evidence Model
```

Normalization enables unified assessment.

---

# Normalized Result

A normalized result may contain:

```text
check_id
status
target
started_at
completed_at
duration
findings
metrics
artifacts
tool
tool_version
configuration
```

This creates a common automation language.

---

# Check Status

A baseline check status model may include:

```text
PASS
FAIL
WARNING
ERROR
SKIPPED
NOT_APPLICABLE
```

These states must remain semantically distinct.

---

# PASS

`PASS` means the check executed successfully and its required condition was satisfied.

---

# FAIL

`FAIL` means the check executed correctly but detected a quality violation.

---

# WARNING

`WARNING` means the check identified a non-blocking condition.

---

# ERROR

`ERROR` means the check itself could not reliably execute or produce a valid conclusion.

For example:

```text
Tool Crash
Invalid Configuration
Missing Dependency
Corrupt Result
```

`ERROR` must never silently become `PASS`.

---

# SKIPPED

`SKIPPED` means the check was intentionally not executed.

The reason should be recorded.

---

# NOT_APPLICABLE

`NOT_APPLICABLE` means the check does not apply to the evaluated target.

This is different from skipping a required check.

---

# Automation Evidence

Every significant automated check should generate Quality Evidence.

Evidence may include:

```text
Check Identity
Target
Revision
Result
Tool
Tool Version
Configuration
Timestamp
Duration
Findings
Artifacts
```

This supports reproducibility and auditability.

---

# Evidence Generation

The automation pipeline should automatically convert successful execution into structured evidence.

Conceptually:

```text
Check Execution
      ↓
Raw Result
      ↓
Normalization
      ↓
Evidence Record
```

Manual transcription should be avoided.

---

# Evidence Integrity

Automation evidence should preserve enough information to detect invalid or stale results.

Potential integrity information includes:

```text
Source Revision
Configuration Fingerprint
Tool Version
Profile Version
Artifact Digest
```

This prevents inappropriate evidence reuse.

---

# Evidence Freshness

Automated evidence is valid only for the relevant target state.

Example:

```text
Commit A
      ↓
Tests PASS
      ↓
Commit B modifies tested code
      ↓
Previous test evidence may be stale
```

Automation should support evidence invalidation.

---

# Phase 5 Ruff Runtime Contract

The initial canonical Ruff integration SHALL implement the existing
`QualityExecutorPort` through the Quality infrastructure layer. It SHALL remain
independent of the Plugin Compliance `QualityRuffValidator`; that validator is
an existing bounded-context workflow whose behavior SHALL remain functional,
but its class and compliance-specific models SHALL NOT become dependencies of
the canonical Quality runtime.

## Canonical Ruff Invocation

The initial Quality Ruff adapter SHALL execute Ruff through the active FamilyOS
Python interpreter rather than relying on a separately resolved `ruff` binary:

```text
<python executable> -m ruff check <target path> --output-format=json
```

The Python executable SHALL default to the active interpreter represented by
`sys.executable`. Execution SHALL occur without shell interpretation.

The target path SHALL come from the governed `QualityTarget` path contract.
Phase 5 SHALL NOT introduce Quality Profiles, generic execution-context models,
or tool-specific configuration domain models merely to invoke Ruff.

## Ruff Execution Semantics

Ruff exit status and structured output SHALL be normalized as follows:

```text
exit 0 + valid JSON     -> PASS
exit 1 + valid JSON     -> FAIL
other exit status       -> ERROR
timeout                 -> ERROR
process / OS failure    -> ERROR
invalid Ruff JSON       -> ERROR
```

`FAIL` means Ruff executed reliably and reported governed lint violations.
`ERROR` means the check could not reliably execute or conclude. `ERROR` SHALL
NOT silently become `PASS`.

## Ruff Finding Mapping

Each Ruff violation SHALL become a `QualityFinding`.

The governed FamilyOS rule remains authoritative for Quality semantics:

```text
QualityFinding.rule_id  = QualityRule.id
QualityFinding.domain   = QualityRule.domain
QualityFinding.severity = QualityRule.severity
QualityFinding.status   = FAIL
QualityFinding.target   = supplied QualityTarget
```

The native Ruff rule code, such as `F401`, SHALL NOT be promoted or rewritten
as a `QLT-RULE-*` identifier. It SHALL be preserved as tool-native information.

The Ruff message SHALL map to the finding message. File path, line, and column
SHALL be preserved where Ruff supplies them. The initial adapter MAY represent
that source position through the existing optional finding `location` string;
Phase 5 SHALL NOT introduce a new source-location domain model.

## Finding and Evidence Identity

Phase 5 SHALL preserve the existing `QLT-FIND-*` and `QLT-EVID-*` identity
contracts. The initial Ruff adapter SHALL NOT embed random identity generation
inside Ruff parsing.

Finding and evidence identity creation SHALL be supplied to the adapter through
small injected factories/callables that return valid `QualityFindingId` and
`QualityEvidenceId` values. This keeps identity generation testable and avoids
introducing a generic Quality identity framework before such a framework is
canonically required.

## Ruff Evidence

The initial Ruff adapter SHALL produce one `QualityEvidence` record for one
governed Ruff execution. It SHALL NOT require one evidence record per Ruff
violation.

The evidence SHALL:

* use `STATIC_ANALYSIS` as its Quality evidence type;
* bind to the supplied `QualityTarget`;
* bind `rule_id` to the supplied `QualityRule.id`;
* identify Ruff as the tool;
* preserve the captured Ruff version when available;
* preserve machine-readable native execution information in the existing
  immutable metadata boundary where practical;
* use the injected timezone-aware clock for `created_at`;
* use the injected evidence identity factory;
* remain revision-optional for this initial Phase 5 slice.

Each produced finding SHALL reference the execution evidence identifier through
its existing `evidence_ids` boundary.

Phase 5 does not close the deferred Quality Evidence freshness or full
revision-awareness contract. The initial Ruff adapter SHALL NOT depend on Build
or Testing source-state models merely to populate `revision`.

## Ruff Tool Version

The adapter SHALL attempt to collect the Ruff version using the same active
Python interpreter:

```text
<python executable> -m ruff --version
```

A successful version probe SHALL populate `QualityEvidence.tool_version`.

Failure of the version probe alone SHALL be handled gracefully: the evidence
MAY use `tool_version=None`, and the normalized check result SHALL retain a
diagnostic explaining that the Ruff version was unavailable. A version-probe
failure SHALL NOT erase an otherwise trustworthy Ruff `PASS` or `FAIL`.

Failure to execute the governed Ruff check itself remains `ERROR`.

## Phase 5 Infrastructure Boundary

The initial Ruff implementation MAY introduce a Ruff-specific infrastructure
adapter and its focused tests.

It SHALL NOT:

* introduce a generic `CommandExecutor` or `ProcessExecutor` abstraction solely
  for Phase 5;
* depend on Plugin Compliance runtime models;
* rewrite or relocate the existing Plugin Compliance Ruff validator;
* depend on Build or Testing source-state contracts;
* introduce MyPy, Pytest, Quality Profile, Quality Assessment, Quality Gate,
  Quality CLI, or CI integration behavior;
* authorize Phase 6 or any later Quality implementation phase.

The existing Ruff workflow SHALL remain functional after the canonical Quality
Ruff adapter is introduced.


# Phase 6 MyPy Runtime Contract

The initial canonical MyPy integration SHALL implement the existing
`QualityExecutorPort` through the Quality infrastructure layer. It SHALL remain
independent of the Plugin Compliance `QualityMypyValidator`; that validator is
a behavioral precedent only and SHALL NOT become a dependency of the canonical
Quality runtime.

## Canonical MyPy Invocation

The initial Quality MyPy adapter SHALL execute MyPy through the active FamilyOS
Python interpreter rather than relying on a separately resolved `mypy` binary:

```text
<python executable> -m mypy <target path> --output=json
```

The Python executable SHALL default to `sys.executable`. The governed target
path SHALL come from `QualityTarget.path`. Execution SHALL not use a shell.

## MyPy Execution Semantics

MyPy newline-delimited JSON output SHALL be normalized as follows:

```text
exit 0                       -> PASS
exit 1 with valid findings   -> FAIL
other exit status            -> ERROR
timeout                      -> ERROR
process / OS failure         -> ERROR
invalid JSON                 -> ERROR
invalid diagnostic payload   -> ERROR
protocol inconsistency       -> ERROR
```

`FAIL` means MyPy executed reliably and reported governed type-checking
violations. `ERROR` means the execution or protocol result itself is not
trustworthy.

Exit status `0` SHALL produce no failure findings. Exit status `1` SHALL be
accepted as `FAIL` only when the diagnostic payload is valid and provides the
expected type-checking findings.

## Empty Python Target Compatibility

A governed target path that contains no Python source files SHALL preserve the
existing FamilyOS MyPy behavior rather than invoking MyPy and interpreting its
fatal no-source exit status as an infrastructure failure.

For this initial Phase 6 adapter only, when the governed target contains no
`.py` or `.pyi` source files:

* the main MyPy check SHALL NOT be executed;
* `QualityCheckResult.status` SHALL be `PASS`;
* no findings SHALL be produced;
* one `QualityEvidence` record SHALL be produced with result `PASS`;
* the evidence SHALL retain the canonical `TYPE_VERIFICATION`,
  `source="quality.mypy"`, and `tool="mypy"` identity;
* the result SHALL include the diagnostic
  `No Python source files found; nothing to type-check.`;
* a MyPy version probe is not required because no governed MyPy execution
  occurs.

This is a compatibility normalization required to preserve existing MyPy
behavior. It SHALL NOT establish a general rule that non-applicable Quality
checks are `PASS`.

The broader Quality model distinguishes `NOT_APPLICABLE` from `SKIPPED`.
`SKIPPED` is not the semantic for an empty Python target. The initial
`QualityCheckResult` status model does not expose `NOT_APPLICABLE`, and Phase 6
SHALL NOT expand that model or implement generic applicability resolution.

Generic applicability and authoritative `NOT_APPLICABLE` result propagation
remain outside the Phase 6 MyPy adapter boundary.

## MyPy Finding Mapping

Each reliable MyPy diagnostic SHALL become a `QualityFinding`.

FamilyOS finding authority SHALL remain governed by the supplied
`QualityRule`:

```text
rule_id   = rule.id
domain    = rule.domain
severity  = rule.severity
status    = FAIL
message   = MyPy message
location  = <file>:<line>:<column>
```

The native MyPy `severity` field SHALL NOT be converted into
`QualitySeverity`. The governed FamilyOS severity is `rule.severity`.

Native MyPy diagnostic codes such as `return-value` SHALL remain tool-native
data. They MAY be preserved in Quality Evidence metadata, but SHALL NOT be
promoted into FamilyOS rule identifiers or independent severity policy.

## MyPy Evidence

One actual governed MyPy execution attempt SHALL produce one
`QualityEvidence` record.

The evidence SHALL:

* use canonical `TYPE_VERIFICATION` as the evidence type;
* use `quality.mypy` as the source;
* identify `mypy` as the tool;
* retain the supplied Quality rule and optional requirement authority;
* retain the captured MyPy version when available;
* preserve exit status, diagnostic count, and native MyPy codes where
  available as normalized metadata;
* use `revision=None` initially unless later Quality revision authority is
  explicitly introduced.

`TYPE_CHECK` SHALL NOT be introduced as a second spelling for the same
evidence category.

Execution failures that occur after an actual MyPy execution attempt SHALL
produce `QualityEvidenceResult.ERROR` evidence when enough governed execution
context exists to do so. A missing `QualityTarget.path` remains a pre-execution
contract failure and MAY return an `ERROR` result without execution evidence.

## MyPy Tool Version

The adapter SHALL attempt to collect the MyPy version through the same active
Python interpreter:

```text
<python executable> -m mypy --version
```

An available version SHALL be stored in `QualityEvidence.tool_version`.
Version-probe failure SHALL be non-fatal when the actual MyPy quality result
remains trustworthy. In that case `tool_version` SHALL be `None` and a
diagnostic SHALL record that the MyPy version is unavailable.

Failure to execute the governed MyPy check itself remains `ERROR`.

## Phase 6 Infrastructure Boundary

The initial MyPy adapter SHALL follow the established Quality adapter
construction pattern:

* injected `QualityFindingId` factory;
* injected `QualityEvidenceId` factory;
* injected timezone-aware evidence clock;
* injected monotonic execution clock;
* configurable Python executable;
* configurable timeout.

Phase 6 SHALL NOT introduce a generic `CommandExecutor`, `ProcessExecutor`, or
other generic process framework merely for MyPy.

The current FamilyOS architecture contains no canonical reusable generic
process abstraction that this slice is required to adopt. Existing bounded
contexts MAY continue to own their tool-specific subprocess behavior.

Phase 6 SHALL NOT:

* rewrite or relocate the existing Plugin Compliance MyPy validator;
* create a Quality-to-Plugin dependency;
* create a Plugin-to-Quality dependency merely for this adapter;
* authorize Pytest integration or any later Quality runtime phase.

The existing MyPy workflow SHALL remain functional after the canonical Quality
MyPy adapter is introduced.

---

# Local Quality Automation

Local automation provides rapid developer feedback before remote CI.

Examples include:

```text
ruff check
mypy
pytest
documentation validation
```

Local automation should be easy to execute.

---

# Local Quality Command

FamilyOS may eventually expose a unified command such as:

```text
familyos quality check
```

Conceptually:

```text
familyos quality check
      ↓
Resolve Profile
      ↓
Execute Applicable Checks
      ↓
Generate Evidence
      ↓
Produce Assessment
```

The exact CLI design belongs to implementation planning.

---

# Fast Local Validation

Local validation should optimize for feedback speed.

A fast profile may execute:

```text
Formatting
Linting
Type Checking
Affected Unit Tests
Basic Architecture Checks
```

Expensive validation may remain in CI.

---

# Full Local Validation

Developers should also be able to execute a comprehensive profile locally where practical.

Example:

```text
familyos quality check --profile full
```

A local full run should approximate CI behavior closely.

---

# Environment Consistency

Local and CI automation should minimize environmental differences.

Conceptually:

```text
Local Rules
      =
CI Rules
```

where practical.

Different execution environments may exist, but quality policy should remain consistent.

---

# Pre-Commit Automation

Pre-commit validation may execute very fast checks.

Suitable examples include:

* formatting;
* linting;
* lightweight static validation;
* metadata validation.

Pre-commit hooks should not become so slow that developers routinely bypass them.

---

# Commit-Time Automation

Some checks may validate:

* commit metadata;
* generated files;
* documentation references;
* repository structure.

Commit-time automation should remain deterministic.

---

# Pull Request Automation

Pull requests are a major Quality Automation boundary.

A conceptual PR pipeline is:

```text
Pull Request
      ↓
Change Analysis
      ↓
Profile Resolution
      ↓
Automated Checks
      ↓
Evidence
      ↓
Assessment
      ↓
Quality Gate
      ↓
Merge Decision
```

---

# Pull Request Feedback

Automation should provide actionable feedback.

Instead of:

```text
Quality failed.
```

the system should provide:

```text
Architecture Check FAILED

Rule:
QLT-RULE-ARCH-004

Target:
src/familyos_cli/plugins/example/plugin.py

Reason:
Plugin implementation imports an internal core module.

Required Action:
Use the public capability contract.
```

---

# Fast Failure

When a deterministic blocking failure is discovered, automation may stop expensive downstream work where appropriate.

Example:

```text
Syntax Failure
      ↓
No reason to execute full integration suite
```

This reduces CI cost.

---

# Parallel Execution

Independent quality checks may execute in parallel.

Example:

```text
              ┌─ Lint
              ├─ Type Check
Change ───────┼─ Unit Tests
              ├─ Documentation
              └─ Architecture
```

Parallelization can reduce feedback time significantly.

---

# Dependency-Aware Execution

Some checks depend on others.

Example:

```text
Build
  ↓
Integration Tests
  ↓
Packaging Validation
```

The automation engine should model these dependencies explicitly.

---

# Quality Automation Graph

The complete automation pipeline can be modeled as a directed graph.

Example:

```text
Source Validation
      ↓
Static Analysis
      ↓
Unit Tests
      ↓
Build
      ↓
Integration Tests
      ↓
Packaging
      ↓
Release Validation
```

Independent nodes may execute concurrently.

---

# Check Dependency

A quality check may define:

```text
requires
provides
```

For example:

```text
Integration Test Check

requires:
build-artifact

provides:
integration-test-evidence
```

This enables composable automation.

---

# Incremental Automation

Not every change requires every quality check.

Incremental automation may determine affected scope.

Example:

```text
Documentation-Only Change
      ↓
Documentation Validation
Metadata Validation
Reference Validation
```

without executing unrelated expensive runtime tests when policy permits.

---

# Impact Analysis

Incremental execution requires reliable impact analysis.

Impact analysis may consider:

```text
Changed Files
Dependency Graph
Affected Modules
Affected Plugins
Public Contracts
Configuration
```

Incorrect impact analysis may create false confidence.

---

# Conservative Impact Analysis

When impact cannot be determined reliably, the system should prefer broader validation.

Conceptually:

```text
Impact Unknown
      ↓
Expand Validation Scope
```

rather than skipping potentially relevant checks.

---

# Change Classification

Automation may classify changes such as:

```text
Documentation
Code
Architecture
Dependency
Configuration
Security
Build
Release
```

Classification may influence Quality Profile resolution.

---

# Risk-Based Automation

Automation depth should reflect risk.

Example:

```text
Low-Risk Change
      ↓
Fast Quality Profile

High-Risk Change
      ↓
Full Quality Profile
      +
Additional Security Checks
      +
Compatibility Validation
```

Risk-based execution should remain policy-driven.

---

# Profile-Based Automation

Quality Profiles determine applicable checks.

Conceptually:

```text
Target
      ↓
Quality Profile
      ↓
Required Checks
```

Example:

```text
Official Plugin Profile
      ↓
Lint
Type Check
Unit Tests
Integration Tests
Architecture Validation
Plugin Compliance
Documentation Validation
```

---

# Automation Composition

Profiles should compose reusable checks rather than duplicate pipelines.

Example:

```text
Python Base Profile
      +
Plugin Profile
      +
Official Plugin Profile
      +
Security-Sensitive Profile
```

This supports scalable quality policy.

---

# Static Analysis Automation

Static analysis should be fully automated where possible.

FamilyOS currently uses tools such as:

```text
Ruff
MyPy
```

These checks provide fast deterministic feedback.

---

# Lint Automation

Lint automation may validate:

* coding errors;
* style rules;
* import issues;
* unsafe patterns.

Lint failures should produce structured findings.

---

# Type Checking Automation

Type checking verifies static type expectations.

Conceptually:

```text
Python Source
      ↓
MyPy
      ↓
Type Evidence
```

Type checking is one quality signal, not proof of correctness.

---

# Test Automation

Testing is one of the primary Quality Automation domains.

The Testing Framework defines test strategy.

The Quality Framework consumes test evidence.

Automation may execute:

```text
Unit Tests
Integration Tests
Functional Tests
System Tests
Contract Tests
Regression Tests
```

---

# Unit Test Automation

Unit tests should provide rapid feedback and are strong candidates for local and PR execution.

---

# Integration Test Automation

Integration tests validate collaboration between components.

They may require:

* fixtures;
* temporary infrastructure;
* test repositories;
* external service simulation.

Automation should make required environments reproducible.

---

# Regression Automation

Every corrected significant defect should be evaluated for regression automation.

Conceptually:

```text
Defect
      ↓
Fix
      ↓
Regression Test
      ↓
Automated Protection
```

---

# Flaky Test Automation

Automation should identify flaky tests rather than repeatedly hiding them through retries.

Retries may provide diagnostic value.

They must not convert instability into false PASS results.

---

# Flaky Test Detection

Potential signals include:

```text
Same Revision
Same Configuration
Different Test Result
```

Repeated inconsistency should create a Quality Finding or Quality Debt item.

---

# Architecture Automation

Architecture rules should be automated where deterministic.

Examples include:

* forbidden dependency direction;
* layer violations;
* plugin boundary violations;
* reserved namespace rules.

Architecture automation converts architectural principles into executable controls.

---

# Architecture Rule Example

Conceptually:

```text
RULE:
Core domain must not depend on plugin implementations.

CHECK:
Analyze import graph.

FAILURE:
Create Architecture Finding.
```

---

# Documentation Automation

Documentation quality should also participate in automation.

Potential checks include:

```text
Required Files
Naming
Metadata
Internal Links
Structure
References
Document Status
Version Information
```

Automation supports the Documentation Framework.

---

# Documentation Structure Validation

An EPIC may require files such as:

```text
00-EPIC.md
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
```

Automated validation can detect missing required artifacts.

---

# Documentation Link Validation

Broken internal documentation references should be detected automatically where practical.

This prevents documentation architecture from degrading silently.

---

# Documentation Metadata Validation

Automation may verify:

* identifiers;
* status values;
* versions;
* references;
* required metadata.

Metadata validation improves documentation traceability.

---

# Dependency Automation

Dependency quality automation may include:

```text
Dependency Resolution
Version Validation
Vulnerability Scanning
License Validation
Support Status
Lock Consistency
```

Domain-specific policy may be provided by security or dependency frameworks.

---

# Dependency Drift

Automation should detect unexpected dependency drift.

Example:

```text
Declared Dependency State
      ≠
Resolved Dependency State
      ↓
Finding
```

---

# Security Automation

Security automation may include:

* vulnerability scanning;
* secret detection;
* configuration validation;
* dependency analysis;
* security tests.

Security automation supplements, but does not replace, security review.

---

# Secret Detection

Secret detection should prevent accidental credentials from entering the repository.

Detected secrets should be treated carefully because reports may themselves contain sensitive information.

---

# Compliance Automation

Compliance rules should be automated where deterministic.

For FamilyOS official plugins, this may integrate with the Plugin Compliance Framework.

Conceptually:

```text
Plugin
      ↓
Compliance Validator
      ↓
Compliance Evidence
      ↓
Quality Assessment
```

---

# Build Automation

Build automation should verify that FamilyOS can produce expected artifacts reliably.

Checks may include:

```text
Build Success
Artifact Presence
Artifact Structure
Dependency Resolution
Reproducibility
```

---

# Build Reproducibility

Where reproducibility is required, automation should verify that equivalent inputs produce equivalent artifacts or equivalent normalized outputs.

---

# Packaging Automation

Packaging checks may validate:

* required metadata;
* package contents;
* version;
* installability;
* importability.

Packaging failures should be detected before release.

---

# Release Automation

Release automation should consume existing quality evidence rather than independently reinvent quality verification.

Conceptually:

```text
Validated Revision
      ↓
Release Candidate
      ↓
Release Quality Assessment
      ↓
Release Gate
      ↓
Release Automation
```

---

# Release Automation Principle

A release pipeline must not manufacture confidence.

It should prove that the candidate satisfies already-defined quality expectations.

---

# Configuration Automation

Configuration validation may verify:

* schema;
* required values;
* forbidden combinations;
* environment compatibility.

Configuration failures can create significant runtime risk despite correct code.

---

# Repository Automation

Repository-level validation may check:

```text
Directory Structure
Required Files
Naming Conventions
Reserved Paths
Generated Artifact Policy
```

This protects repository architecture.

---

# Generated Artifact Validation

Generated files should be validated for consistency with their source definitions where appropriate.

Conceptually:

```text
Source Definition
      ↓
Generator
      ↓
Generated Artifact
      ↓
Consistency Validation
```

---

# Drift Detection

Automation may detect drift between:

* code and documentation;
* schemas and generated artifacts;
* configuration and implementation;
* specifications and registered identifiers.

Drift detection is an important long-term quality capability.

---

# Quality Gate Automation

Quality Gates should be automatically evaluated when their required evidence is available.

Conceptually:

```text
Assessment
      ↓
Gate Policy
      ↓
PASS / FAIL / CONDITIONAL
```

Gate logic should remain deterministic wherever policy permits.

---

# Merge Gate Automation

A merge gate may require:

```text
Required Checks PASS
No Blocking Findings
No Invalid Exceptions
Required Reviews Complete
```

The exact requirements depend on branch and profile policy.

---

# Release Gate Automation

Release gates may require stronger conditions:

```text
Full Assessment Complete
No Critical Findings
No Unaccepted High Risks
Build Evidence Valid
Release Documentation Complete
```

---

# Gate Failure Explanation

Automated gate failures must be explainable.

Example:

```text
Release Gate FAILED

Reason:
QLT-RULE-SEC-004 failed.

Finding:
QLT-FIND-9812

Severity:
CRITICAL

Exception:
None

Evidence:
QLT-EVID-71A4
```

---

# Automation Orchestration

Quality automation requires orchestration.

The orchestrator may be responsible for:

```text
Profile Resolution
Check Scheduling
Dependency Resolution
Parallel Execution
Evidence Collection
Failure Handling
Assessment Triggering
Reporting
```

---

# Orchestrator Principle

The orchestrator coordinates quality execution.

It should not silently redefine quality policy.

Policy remains defined through Quality Requirements, Rules, Profiles, and Gates.

---

# Automation Configuration

Automation configuration should be version-controlled.

Examples include:

* tool configuration;
* profile definitions;
* thresholds;
* rule activation;
* exclusions.

Configuration changes are quality changes and should be reviewed accordingly.

---

# Configuration Validation

Invalid quality automation configuration must fail visibly.

Example:

```text
Unknown Rule ID
      ↓
Configuration ERROR
```

It must not silently disable the rule.

---

# Configuration Drift

Local and CI configuration should be compared where practical.

Unexpected differences may invalidate reproducibility.

---

# Automation Versioning

Quality automation components should be versioned.

This includes:

```text
Rules
Profiles
Adapters
Evidence Schemas
Assessment Logic
```

Historical evidence must remain interpretable relative to the versions that produced it.

---

# Tool Versioning

Tool versions can affect results.

Therefore evidence should capture relevant tool versions.

Example:

```text
tool:
mypy

version:
1.x
```

This supports reproducibility and troubleshooting.

---

# Automation Upgrade

Tool upgrades should be treated as controlled quality changes.

A new tool version may:

* add findings;
* remove findings;
* change semantics;
* change output format;
* change performance.

Upgrade impact should be evaluated.

---

# Automation Failure

Automation infrastructure can fail independently of the code under evaluation.

Examples include:

```text
CI Worker Failure
Network Failure
Tool Crash
Artifact Storage Failure
Configuration Error
```

These must remain distinguishable from quality failures.

---

# Infrastructure Failure vs Quality Failure

Conceptually:

```text
Test Assertion Failure
      → Quality FAIL

CI Worker Lost
      → Automation ERROR
```

Conflating these states produces incorrect engineering conclusions.

---

# Retry Policy

Retries may be appropriate for transient infrastructure failures.

They should not automatically hide deterministic quality failures.

---

# Timeout Policy

Checks should have explicit timeout behavior where appropriate.

A timeout should generally produce:

```text
ERROR
```

unless the quality rule explicitly defines timeout as a failure condition.

---

# Cancellation

Superseded CI runs may be cancelled to conserve resources.

Cancellation should produce a distinct state rather than incomplete PASS evidence.

---

# Automation Performance

Quality automation must itself satisfy performance expectations.

Important dimensions include:

```text
Feedback Latency
Execution Duration
Resource Consumption
Queue Time
Parallelism
Cache Efficiency
```

Slow automation encourages bypass behavior.

---

# Feedback Latency

The time between engineering change and quality feedback should be minimized.

Conceptually:

```text
Change
      ↓
Short Delay
      ↓
Useful Feedback
```

Fast feedback reduces remediation cost.

---

# Quality Automation Budget

Automation may use execution budgets.

For example:

```text
Local Fast Checks
      → seconds

PR Checks
      → minutes

Full Release Validation
      → longer comprehensive execution
```

Exact targets belong to operational policy.

---

# Check Tiering

Checks may be grouped into execution tiers.

Example:

```text
Tier 1
Fast deterministic checks

Tier 2
Unit and targeted integration tests

Tier 3
Full integration and system validation

Tier 4
Release validation
```

This balances speed and assurance.

---

# Quality Feedback Pyramid

A useful model is:

```text
              Release Validation
                    /\
                   /  \
              System Tests
                 /      \
           Integration Tests
              /          \
         Unit + Static Checks
        /__________________\
```

Fast checks should provide the majority of routine feedback.

---

# Caching

Quality automation may cache valid results.

Examples include:

* dependency environments;
* static analysis state;
* unchanged test results;
* build intermediates.

Caching must not compromise correctness.

---

# Evidence-Aware Caching

Cached quality results should only be reused when relevant inputs are unchanged.

Potential cache keys include:

```text
Source Fingerprint
Dependency Fingerprint
Configuration Fingerprint
Tool Version
Rule Version
```

---

# Cache Invalidation

When correctness is uncertain:

```text
Cache Validity Unknown
      ↓
Recompute
```

Quality confidence takes priority over optimization.

---

# Selective Test Execution

Automation may eventually select tests based on change impact.

Example:

```text
Changed Capability
      ↓
Dependency Analysis
      ↓
Affected Tests
```

This can improve performance substantially.

---

# Full Test Safety Net

Selective testing should be complemented by periodic or milestone-based full execution.

This protects against imperfect dependency analysis.

---

# Parallel Quality Jobs

Independent checks may execute in separate CI jobs.

Example:

```text
quality-lint
quality-type
quality-unit
quality-docs
quality-architecture
```

Their results can later be aggregated into one assessment.

---

# Aggregation

An automation aggregator may collect distributed results.

Conceptually:

```text
Lint Evidence
Type Evidence
Test Evidence
Architecture Evidence
Documentation Evidence
      ↓
Quality Assessment
```

The aggregator should verify completeness before producing an authoritative assessment.

---

# Partial Automation Results

If required jobs are missing, the assessment should be:

```text
INCOMPLETE
```

or:

```text
UNKNOWN
```

according to the assessment model.

Missing jobs must not be interpreted as successful checks.

---

# Automation Observability

The automation system must itself be observable.

Potential telemetry includes:

```text
Check Duration
Check Failure Rate
Infrastructure Error Rate
Queue Duration
Cache Hit Rate
Flaky Result Rate
Evidence Generation Failure
```

This connects Quality Automation with Quality Observability.

---

# Automation Health

The framework may define automation health states such as:

```text
HEALTHY
DEGRADED
UNRELIABLE
UNAVAILABLE
```

An unreliable quality system should reduce confidence in generated assessments.

---

# Automation Reliability

Quality automation is part of the quality control plane.

Its reliability therefore matters directly to engineering confidence.

A pipeline that frequently fails for unrelated infrastructure reasons creates:

* delayed feedback;
* ignored failures;
* bypass pressure;
* reduced trust.

---

# Automation Trust

Engineers should trust that:

```text
PASS
```

means the required check actually executed successfully.

Trust is destroyed when:

* checks silently skip;
* errors become warnings;
* stale results are reused;
* flaky tests are hidden;
* configuration failures disable validation.

---

# Fail-Open vs Fail-Closed

Automation policy should explicitly define failure behavior.

For critical gates:

```text
Unknown State
      ↓
Fail Closed
```

may be appropriate.

For non-critical developer assistance:

```text
Tool Temporarily Unavailable
      ↓
Continue With Warning
```

may sometimes be acceptable.

Behavior must be governed by risk.

---

# Quality Automation Security

Quality automation itself requires security controls.

Potential risks include:

* malicious CI configuration;
* untrusted pull request execution;
* secret exposure;
* artifact tampering;
* unauthorized gate modification.

Automation infrastructure must be treated as trusted engineering infrastructure.

---

# Least Privilege

Quality automation jobs should receive only required permissions.

For example:

```text
Lint Job
      ↓
No Release Credentials Required
```

This reduces automation risk.

---

# Secret Management

Secrets required by automation should not be stored directly in repository configuration.

Secret access should be:

* controlled;
* scoped;
* auditable;
* minimized.

---

# Untrusted Code

Automation executing untrusted changes should not automatically receive privileged credentials.

This is particularly important for external contribution workflows.

---

# Artifact Integrity

Quality and build artifacts should be protected from unauthorized modification.

Evidence should correspond to the actual artifact evaluated.

---

# Automation Audit Trail

Significant automation decisions should be reconstructable.

An audit should answer:

```text
Which checks executed?

Which versions were used?

Which configuration applied?

Which evidence was generated?

Which checks failed?

Why did the gate pass?
```

---

# Automation Reporting

Automation should provide both machine-readable and human-readable results.

Machine-readable output supports:

* assessment;
* dashboards;
* trend analysis;
* API integrations.

Human-readable output supports engineers.

---

# Console Reporting

Console output should prioritize actionable information.

Example:

```text
QUALITY CHECK FAILED

1 blocking finding

QLT-RULE-ARCH-004
src/.../plugin.py

Plugin implementation may not depend on internal core module.
```

---

# Structured Reporting

Structured formats may include:

```text
JSON
JUnit XML
SARIF
FamilyOS Quality Evidence Format
```

External formats may be adapted into the FamilyOS model.

---

# Report Stability

Machine-readable report schemas should be versioned.

Automation consumers should not depend on unstable output formats.

---

# Automation Metrics

Possible Quality Automation metrics include:

```text
Automation Coverage
Check Execution Time
Failure Rate
Error Rate
Flaky Check Rate
Cache Hit Rate
Gate Failure Rate
Manual Check Count
```

---

# Automation Coverage

Automation Coverage measures how much of the defined quality control surface is automated.

Conceptually:

```text
Automation Coverage
=
Automated Applicable Controls
/
Automatable Applicable Controls
```

This should not be confused with test coverage.

---

# Manual Quality Burden

A useful metric may track the number of recurring manual quality checks.

The desired long-term direction is generally:

```text
Repeated Manual Deterministic Checks
      ↓
Automation
```

---

# Automation Debt

Missing or inadequate quality automation may create Quality Debt.

Examples include:

* manual architecture checks;
* manual documentation validation;
* manual release verification;
* unautomated compliance rules.

Automation debt should be prioritized according to risk and repetition cost.

---

# Automation Candidate Identification

A recurring manual activity is a strong automation candidate when it is:

```text
Frequent
Deterministic
Time-Consuming
Error-Prone
Important
```

Not every manual activity should be automated.

---

# Automation ROI

Automation should provide meaningful engineering value.

Potential benefits include:

```text
Reduced Defect Escape
Faster Feedback
Lower Manual Effort
Greater Consistency
Better Evidence
Improved Governance
```

Automation should not exist merely because it is technically possible.

---

# Automation Maintenance Cost

Every automated control introduces maintenance cost.

Costs may include:

* tool upgrades;
* configuration changes;
* false positives;
* performance;
* infrastructure;
* debugging.

Automation design should therefore favor simplicity and composability.

---

# Automation Duplication

Different tools should not repeatedly verify the same condition without justification.

Duplicate checks may create:

* wasted execution;
* inconsistent findings;
* maintenance burden.

Overlap may still be appropriate for critical defense-in-depth scenarios.

---

# Automation Ownership

Every significant automated quality capability should have an owner.

Ownership includes:

* maintenance;
* reliability;
* configuration;
* upgrades;
* documentation;
* incident response.

Unowned automation eventually becomes unreliable automation.

---

# Rule Ownership

Quality rules should also have clear ownership.

The automation tool executes the rule.

The rule owner governs its meaning.

---

# Tool Ownership

Tool integration ownership includes responsibility for:

```text
Adapter
Configuration
Version
Output Normalization
Failure Handling
```

This separates tool maintenance from quality policy ownership.

---

# Automation Change Management

Changes to automation can alter engineering acceptance criteria.

Therefore changes such as:

```text
Disable Check
Change Severity
Modify Threshold
Add Exclusion
Change Gate Behavior
```

must be treated as quality policy changes where applicable.

---

# Automation Review

Significant automation changes should receive review.

Review should ask:

```text
Does this preserve the intended quality requirement?

Could this create false PASS results?

Does it affect historical comparability?

Does it alter gate behavior?
```

---

# Rule Rollout

New automated rules may require controlled rollout.

A possible lifecycle is:

```text
OBSERVE
      ↓
WARN
      ↓
ENFORCE
```

This is particularly useful when introducing rules into legacy areas.

---

# Observe Mode

In `OBSERVE` mode, the rule collects data without affecting progression.

This helps estimate:

* finding volume;
* false positives;
* remediation cost.

---

# Warning Mode

In `WARN` mode, findings are visible but non-blocking.

This allows teams to begin remediation before enforcement.

---

# Enforcement Mode

In `ENFORCE` mode, applicable failures affect assessments or gates according to policy.

---

# Baseline-Aware Automation

Legacy violations may be baselined while new violations are blocked.

Example:

```text
Known Violations:
42

New Violations:
0 required
```

Automation should detect baseline growth.

---

# Baseline Fingerprinting

Baseline entries should use stable fingerprints where possible.

This allows the system to distinguish:

```text
Existing Violation
```

from:

```text
New Violation
```

---

# Baseline Retirement

When a baselined issue is fixed, its baseline entry should be removed.

Baselines should shrink over time.

---

# Suppression Automation

Rule suppressions should be machine-readable and traceable where practical.

A suppression may require:

```text
Rule ID
Reason
Scope
Owner
Expiration
```

This prevents invisible permanent suppression.

---

# Expired Suppression

Automation should detect expired suppressions.

Conceptually:

```text
Suppression Expired
      ↓
Original Rule Active
```

---

# Quality Exception Integration

Formal Quality Exceptions should integrate with automation.

The automation system should validate:

* exception identity;
* scope;
* expiration;
* applicable rule;
* authority.

Invalid exceptions must not suppress findings.

---

# Exception-Aware Automation

Conceptually:

```text
Rule Failure
      ↓
Matching Valid Exception?
      ├── No → Finding
      └── Yes → Exception-Aware Result
```

The underlying deviation must remain visible.

---

# Automation and Risk

Automation should consume risk context where policy requires.

For example:

```text
Same Finding
      ↓
Standard Target
      → Warning

Critical Target
      → Blocking
```

The automation check detects the condition.

Assessment and gate policy determine contextual consequence.

---

# Automation and Defects

Repeated automation findings may create managed defects.

Conceptually:

```text
Automated Finding
      ↓
Triage
      ↓
Persistent Significant Issue
      ↓
Defect
```

Not every transient failure should become a permanent defect record.

---

# Automation and Quality Debt

Persistent accepted automation failures may become Quality Debt.

Example:

```text
Architecture Rule Violation
      ↓
Temporary Exception
      ↓
Quality Debt
      ↓
Planned Remediation
```

---

# Automation and Reviews

Automation should support human review by removing repetitive deterministic checks.

Conceptually:

```text
Machine
      ↓
Syntax
Lint
Types
Tests
Rules

Human
      ↓
Design
Architecture
Risk
Intent
Trade-offs
```

This division improves review quality.

---

# Automation and Assessments

Automation provides structured inputs to Quality Assessments.

```text
Automated Checks
      ↓
Evidence
      ↓
Assessment
```

Automation should not bypass assessment semantics.

---

# Automation and Governance

Governance defines:

* required automation;
* mandatory checks;
* enforcement policy;
* exceptions;
* ownership;
* change control.

Automation operationalizes governance.

---

# Automation and Compliance

Compliance automation should expose rule-level results.

Example:

```text
Plugin Compliance

Rules Evaluated: 42
PASS: 42
FAIL: 0
```

The result may then become Quality Evidence.

---

# Automation and Documentation

Documentation should describe:

* how checks run;
* how failures are interpreted;
* how to reproduce them locally;
* how exceptions work;
* who owns the automation.

Automation without understandable documentation creates operational friction.

---

# Automation Discoverability

Engineers should be able to determine:

```text
Which checks apply to my change?

Why does this check exist?

How do I run it locally?

How do I fix the failure?
```

This information should be easy to discover.

---

# Automation Developer Experience

Quality automation should support developers rather than surprise them.

Good automation is:

```text
Fast
Predictable
Actionable
Reproducible
Explainable
```

Poor automation creates resistance to quality controls.

---

# Actionable Failures

Every automated failure should ideally answer:

```text
What failed?

Where?

Why?

Which rule?

How can I reproduce it?

What should I do next?
```

---

# Noise Reduction

Automation should minimize low-value noise.

Excessive warnings lead to warning fatigue.

A mature system prefers:

```text
Fewer
Higher-Quality
Actionable
Findings
```

over large volumes of irrelevant output.

---

# False Positive Management

Automated rules producing frequent false positives should be reviewed.

Potential actions include:

* improve rule;
* narrow scope;
* change severity;
* temporarily disable with governance.

Repeated manual suppression is not a sustainable solution.

---

# False Negative Management

False negatives are particularly dangerous because they create false confidence.

Incidents and escaped defects should evaluate whether automation should have detected the condition.

---

# Automation Effectiveness

Automation effectiveness can be evaluated through:

```text
Defects Prevented
Defects Detected Earlier
Manual Effort Reduced
False Positive Rate
False Negative Evidence
Feedback Time
```

---

# Automation Calibration

Rules and checks should evolve based on actual engineering outcomes.

Example:

```text
Repeated Escaped Defect
      ↓
Missing Automated Control
      ↓
New Quality Rule
      ↓
Automated Prevention
```

---

# Automation Learning Loop

The desired loop is:

```text
Defect / Incident
      ↓
Root Cause
      ↓
Can This Be Detected Automatically?
      ↓
New or Improved Rule
      ↓
Automation
      ↓
Earlier Future Detection
```

This is a central mechanism of continuous quality improvement.

---

# Automation Resilience

Quality automation should tolerate expected infrastructure variability without compromising correctness.

Resilience mechanisms may include:

* controlled retry;
* isolated jobs;
* caching;
* artifact recovery;
* deterministic re-execution.

---

# Automation Recovery

When quality infrastructure fails, engineers should be able to:

```text
Identify Failure
      ↓
Reproduce
      ↓
Recover
      ↓
Regenerate Evidence
```

Recovery must not require manual fabrication of PASS evidence.

---

# Automation Disaster Scenario

If central quality infrastructure is unavailable, governance should define fallback behavior.

For critical releases, the default may be:

```text
Required Evidence Unavailable
      ↓
Release Blocked
```

unless an authorized emergency process exists.

---

# Emergency Quality Process

Emergency processes may allow manual verification under exceptional conditions.

Such processes should require:

* explicit authority;
* recorded evidence;
* risk assessment;
* retrospective automation restoration.

Emergency processes must not become normal workflow.

---

# Quality Automation API

A future Quality Platform may expose an automation API.

Conceptually:

```text
run_check(target, profile)
get_result(check_id)
get_evidence(execution_id)
get_findings(execution_id)
```

The exact API belongs to future implementation design.

---

# Quality Automation Events

Automation may emit events such as:

```text
quality.check.started
quality.check.completed
quality.check.failed
quality.evidence.created
quality.assessment.completed
quality.gate.failed
```

These events may support observability and integrations.

---

# Event Integrity

Quality events should reference stable identities.

Example:

```text
event:
quality.check.failed

check:
QLT-CHECK-ARCH

rule:
QLT-RULE-ARCH-004

target:
communication-plugin
```

---

# Automation Storage

Automation may require storage for:

* evidence;
* reports;
* logs;
* artifacts;
* historical metrics.

Storage should support retention and traceability requirements.

---

# Automation Retention

Retention may vary by artifact.

For example:

```text
Temporary Raw Logs
      → short retention

Release Evidence
      → long retention
```

Governance should define authoritative retention policy.

---

# Automation Data Volume

Quality automation can generate substantial data.

The framework should distinguish between:

```text
Authoritative Evidence
Diagnostic Logs
Temporary Artifacts
Metrics
```

Not all data requires permanent retention.

---

# Automation Scalability

As FamilyOS grows, automation should scale across:

```text
More Plugins
More Tests
More Rules
More Repositories
More Contributors
More Releases
```

Scalability must be considered in architecture.

---

# Distributed Automation

Future FamilyOS development may require distributed execution.

The quality model should remain stable regardless of whether checks execute:

```text
Locally
CI Worker
Container
Remote Runner
Specialized Service
```

Execution location must not redefine quality semantics.

---

# Automation Determinism

Where practical, identical inputs should produce equivalent quality conclusions.

Conceptually:

```text
Same Source
Same Configuration
Same Tool Version
Same Environment Contract
      ↓
Same Result
```

Non-determinism should be treated as a quality concern.

---

# Reproducibility

A developer should ideally be able to reproduce a CI quality failure locally or in an equivalent controlled environment.

Reproducibility reduces remediation time.

---

# Environment Capture

Evidence may capture relevant environment information such as:

```text
Python Version
Operating System
Architecture
Dependency State
```

Only information relevant to reproducibility should be retained.

---

# Cross-Platform Automation

If FamilyOS supports multiple platforms, quality automation should verify relevant platform combinations.

The required matrix should remain proportional to actual support policy.

---

# Matrix Testing

Automation may execute combinations such as:

```text
Python 3.12
Python 3.13

Linux
macOS
```

The exact matrix belongs to compatibility and release policy.

---

# Matrix Explosion

Combinatorial test matrices can become expensive.

Automation should use:

* risk-based selection;
* representative combinations;
* milestone-based full matrices.

Coverage strategy must remain explicit.

---

# Automation Governance Model

Quality Automation governance should define:

```text
Rule Authority
Profile Authority
Tool Ownership
Configuration Ownership
Gate Authority
Exception Authority
```

This prevents uncontrolled changes to quality enforcement.

---

# Automation Policy Change

A change that weakens enforcement should receive particular scrutiny.

Examples include:

```text
Disable Security Check
Lower Coverage Threshold
Exclude Architecture Path
Convert Failure to Warning
```

Such changes should require explicit justification.

---

# Automation Audit

Periodic automation audits may verify:

* required checks still execute;
* configuration matches policy;
* evidence is complete;
* exceptions are valid;
* tools are maintained;
* gates cannot be bypassed unintentionally.

---

# Quality Control Plane

The automation system forms part of the FamilyOS Quality Control Plane.

Conceptually:

```text
Quality Policy
      ↓
Rules
      ↓
Automation
      ↓
Evidence
      ↓
Assessment
      ↓
Gates
```

Compromise of this control plane can compromise engineering confidence.

---

# Automation Anti-Patterns

The Quality Automation model rejects several anti-patterns.

## Automation Without Requirement

A tool should not be added merely because it exists.

Every significant check should serve a quality objective.

## Tool Defines Policy

Tool configuration must implement policy, not replace architectural quality reasoning.

## Silent Skip

Required checks must never disappear silently.

## Error Equals Pass

Infrastructure failure is not quality success.

## Retry Until Green

Repeated execution must not hide deterministic or flaky failures.

## Permanent Suppression

Suppressions require governance and should be minimized.

## Stale Evidence Reuse

Evidence must correspond to relevant target state.

## CI-Only Reproducibility

Developers should be able to reproduce important failures where practical.

## Automation Without Ownership

Unowned quality automation becomes unreliable.

## Maximum Automation at Any Cost

Automation must remain economically justified and maintainable.

---

# Initial Automation Model

An initial FamilyOS Quality Automation implementation may begin with:

```text
Quality Check
      ↓
Command Executor
      ↓
Exit Status
      ↓
Normalized Result
      ↓
Evidence Record
```

Initial checks may include:

```text
Ruff
MyPy
Pytest
Documentation Validation
Repository Validation
```

This is sufficient to establish a strong automation foundation.

---

# Initial Quality Command

A future initial interface may conceptually provide:

```text
familyos quality check
```

with output similar to:

```text
FamilyOS Quality Check

Lint                 PASS
Type Check           PASS
Unit Tests           PASS
Architecture         PASS
Documentation        PASS

Overall              PASS
```

The exact command and output format should be defined during implementation.

---

# Initial CI Pipeline

A practical first CI model may be:

```text
Checkout
   ↓
Environment Setup
   ↓
Lint
   ↓
Type Check
   ↓
Tests
   ↓
Documentation Validation
   ↓
Quality Evidence
   ↓
Assessment
```

As the Quality Framework matures, additional checks can be integrated.

---

# Automation Evolution

Quality Automation should evolve incrementally.

The sequence should generally be:

```text
Manual Practice
      ↓
Stable Requirement
      ↓
Repeatable Check
      ↓
Automation
      ↓
Evidence
      ↓
Gate Integration
```

Automating unstable policy too early can create unnecessary maintenance.

---

# Automation Maturity Model

Quality Automation may mature through:

```text
Level 1
Manual Quality Checks

    ↓

Level 2
Independent Automated Tools

    ↓

Level 3
Standardized Quality Commands

    ↓

Level 4
Structured Evidence Generation

    ↓

Level 5
Profile-Based Automation

    ↓

Level 6
Risk-Based Incremental Automation

    ↓

Level 7
Continuous Quality Control Plane
```

---

# Continuous Quality Automation

At high maturity, FamilyOS quality automation becomes continuously integrated into engineering work.

Conceptually:

```text
Developer Change
      ↓
Automatic Impact Analysis
      ↓
Applicable Quality Profile
      ↓
Optimized Quality Checks
      ↓
Structured Evidence
      ↓
Quality Assessment
      ↓
Gate Decision
      ↓
Immediate Feedback
```

Quality becomes part of the engineering runtime rather than an external verification phase.

---

# Relationship With Testing Framework

The Testing Framework defines:

```text
What should be tested
How tests are structured
Which testing levels exist
How test quality is governed
```

Quality Automation defines:

```text
How applicable tests are executed
How their results become evidence
How execution integrates with assessment and gates
```

The frameworks therefore complement each other.

---

# Relationship With Documentation Framework

The Documentation Framework defines documentation standards and lifecycle.

Quality Automation executes deterministic documentation validation and converts results into Quality Evidence.

---

# Relationship With Build Framework

The Build Framework defines build behavior.

Quality Automation verifies build quality and collects build evidence.

---

# Relationship With Release Framework

The Release Framework defines release lifecycle.

Quality Automation supplies the evidence and gate evaluation required for controlled releases.

---

# Relationship With Plugin Compliance Framework

The Plugin Compliance Framework defines plugin compliance rules.

Quality Automation executes or integrates compliance validation and provides normalized results to the broader Quality Framework.

---

# Relationship With Quality Evidence

Automation is a primary producer of Quality Evidence.

```text
Automation
      ↓
Evidence
```

Evidence must remain traceable to the execution that produced it.

---

# Relationship With Quality Metrics

Automation produces measurable operational information.

Examples include:

```text
Execution Duration
Failure Rate
Flaky Rate
Automation Coverage
```

These metrics support Quality Metrics and Observability.

---

# Relationship With Quality Risk

Risk determines automation depth and enforcement strength.

```text
Risk
      ↓
Profile
      ↓
Automation Depth
```

Higher-risk targets may require stronger automated assurance.

---

# Relationship With Quality Debt

Missing automation may become Quality Debt.

Repeated automation failures may also reveal existing quality debt.

---

# Relationship With Quality Reviews

Automation handles deterministic verification.

Reviews handle contextual judgment.

Together they form:

```text
Automated Verification
      +
Human Review
      ↓
Quality Assessment
```

---

# Relationship With Quality Gates

Automation provides gate inputs.

Quality Gates remain the authoritative progression mechanism.

```text
Automated Checks
      ↓
Evidence
      ↓
Assessment
      ↓
Gate
```

---

# Relationship With Quality Governance

Governance defines which automated controls are authoritative, mandatory, optional, or informational.

Automation must enforce governance without silently redefining it.

---

# Reference Automation Flow

# Strategic Outcome

Quality Automation enables FamilyOS to move from:

```text
Before merging, remember to run all the important checks.
```

toward:

```text
The applicable FamilyOS Quality Profile automatically
determines which controls are required.

Those controls execute consistently.

Their results are normalized into traceable evidence.

Failures produce actionable findings.

Assessments interpret the complete quality state.

Quality Gates enforce the required engineering policy.
```

This creates a scalable quality system.

---

# Final Automation Principle

Automation is not the objective of the Quality Framework.

Reliable engineering confidence is the objective.

Automation is the mechanism that makes repeatable quality controls fast, consistent, scalable, traceable, and enforceable.

The FamilyOS Quality Automation model therefore establishes the relationship:

```text
Quality Requirement
      ↓
Executable Control
      ↓
Automated Verification
      ↓
Quality Evidence
      ↓
Assessment
      ↓
Quality Gate
      ↓
Engineering Decision
```

Through deterministic execution, normalized evidence, profile-based orchestration, risk-aware validation, CI integration, reliable failure semantics, observability, governance, and continuous improvement, Quality Automation transforms FamilyOS quality assurance from a collection of individual engineering practices into an integrated engineering capability.

# Phase 4 Runtime Contract Reconciliation

The initial executable Phase 4 runtime SHALL establish a stable,
tool-independent verification-adapter boundary without prematurely implementing
the Ruff, MyPy, Pytest, documentation-validation, Plugin Compliance, or other
tool adapters governed by later phases.

## Quality Check Identity

Phase 4 SHALL introduce `QualityCheckId` as the stable runtime identity of a
Quality check.

`QualityCheckId` SHALL:

- be an immutable validated value object;
- use the governed `QLT-CHECK-*` namespace;
- follow the same `SPEC-0002`-compatible stable-boundary strategy used by the
  existing Quality runtime identifiers;
- require a canonical non-empty suffix;
- preserve supplied canonical identifiers without inferring semantics from the
  suffix; and
- avoid a narrower suffix taxonomy that would reject existing identifiers such
  as `QLT-CHECK-LINT`, `QLT-CHECK-TYPE`, `QLT-CHECK-UNIT`,
  `QLT-CHECK-ARCH`, or `QLT-CHECK-DOC`.

The temporary executable or command name SHALL NOT define check identity.

## Normalized Quality Check Result

The initial normalized execution result SHALL be an immutable application-layer
model named `QualityCheckResult`.

Its initial runtime fields SHALL be:

```text
check_id
status
findings
evidence
duration_seconds
diagnostics
```

- `check_id` is a `QualityCheckId`;
- `status` is the existing `QualityStatus`;
- `findings` is an immutable tuple of `QualityFinding` values;
- `evidence` is an immutable tuple of `QualityEvidence` values;
- `duration_seconds` is a non-negative floating-point number of seconds; and
- `diagnostics` is an immutable tuple of non-empty strings.

A `PASS` result MAY contain zero findings. Phase 4 SHALL NOT invent assessment
policy that forbids every finding on a `PASS` result.

The normalized check result is an application execution contract. It SHALL NOT
be promoted into a new Quality domain entity merely because it references
domain values.

## Check Status Semantics

The initial Phase 4 normalized check result SHALL reuse the established
`QualityStatus` runtime vocabulary:

```text
PASS
WARNING
FAIL
ERROR
SKIPPED
UNKNOWN
```

`FAIL` means the check executed reliably and detected a Quality violation.
`ERROR` means the check could not reliably execute or could not produce a valid
conclusion. Tool crashes, missing executables, invalid or corrupt native
results, and timeouts SHALL normally normalize to `ERROR` unless a later
governed rule explicitly establishes different semantics. `ERROR` SHALL NOT
silently become `PASS`.

The broader automation documentation also discusses `NOT_APPLICABLE`.
Phase 4 SHALL NOT silently mutate the established `QualityStatus` vocabulary to
add that state. `NOT_APPLICABLE` remains available in the distinct
`QualityEvidenceResult` vocabulary and any future check-status reconciliation
MUST be explicit.

## Quality Executor Application Port

Phase 4 SHALL introduce a tool-independent Quality Executor application port.

The initial port SHALL use a simple `execute(...) -> QualityCheckResult`
boundary appropriate to the current FamilyOS application architecture.

The conceptual `prepare()`, `execute()`, `collect()`, and `normalize()` stages
remain explanatory decomposition only. They SHALL NOT require four public port
methods.

The initial executor contract SHALL operate only on Quality runtime concepts
already authorized for the slice. It SHALL NOT introduce a dependency on
`QualityProfile`, Quality Gate policy, CI-provider configuration, or
tool-specific configuration merely because those concepts appear in broader
automation examples.

`QualityRule.executor` remains an opaque logical reference. It SHALL NOT become
the executor object, callable, subprocess runner, or adapter instance.

## Execution and Normalization Boundary

Tool-specific execution details SHALL remain outside the Quality domain.

Native exit codes, stdout, stderr, reports, metrics, artifacts, timing, and
other tool representations SHALL not automatically become authoritative
Quality Evidence.

Later tool adapters SHALL translate native execution state into the normalized
Quality application contract and canonical Quality Evidence without leaking
tool or subprocess semantics into the Quality domain.

Phase 4 SHALL define error-normalization behavior at the contract boundary, but
it SHALL NOT implement a later-phase tool merely to demonstrate the contract.

## Subprocess Boundary

No reusable canonical FamilyOS command/process abstraction has been established
as a prerequisite for this initial Quality slice.

The Phase 4 subprocess checklist remains conditional on an actual reusable
command executor being required.

Phase 4 SHALL NOT introduce a generic `CommandExecutor`, `ProcessExecutor`, or
equivalent abstraction solely to close conditional checklist items.

Concrete adapters introduced by later phases remain responsible for proving
stdout, stderr, exit-code, duration, timeout, and executable-not-found behavior
where applicable.

## Tool Version Boundary

`QualityEvidence` already supports descriptive `tool` and `tool_version`
metadata.

Actual tool-version collection, storage from real adapter execution, and
graceful unavailable-version handling SHALL remain open until concrete Quality
tool adapters exist.

## Initial Phase 4 Implementation Boundary

The initial executable Phase 4 slice MAY implement:

- `QualityCheckId`;
- immutable `QualityCheckResult`;
- the tool-independent Quality Executor application port;
- validation and contract tests;
- architecture-test evolution required to authorize the Phase 4 contract.

The initial executable Phase 4 slice SHALL NOT implement:

- Ruff integration;
- MyPy integration;
- Pytest integration;
- documentation-validator integration;
- Plugin Compliance integration;
- Quality Profiles;
- Quality Assessment;
- Quality Gates;
- Quality CLI;
- CI integration;
- a generic subprocess framework without demonstrated need;
- tool-version probing without a concrete adapter; or
- tool-specific behavior in the Quality domain.
