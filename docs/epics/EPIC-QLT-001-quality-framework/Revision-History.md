# EPIC-QLT-001 — Quality Framework Revision History

## Document Purpose

This document records the evolution of **EPIC-QLT-001 — Quality Framework**.

It preserves the historical development, normalization, validation, governance, publication, and post-publication revalidation context of the FamilyOS Quality Framework.

The revision history distinguishes between:

* framework document versioning;
* repository-wide publication tagging;
* historical immutable release states;
* canonical structure normalization;
* validation evidence;
* post-publication corrections;
* future framework evolution.

## Revision Principles

The Quality Framework revision history follows several principles.

### Historical Integrity

Published repository states SHALL remain historically identifiable.

A historical publication tag SHALL NOT be silently moved to a later commit merely because documentation is corrected or revalidated after publication.

---

### Explicit Evolution

Material framework changes should be recorded explicitly.

Changes affecting:

* architecture;
* semantics;
* governance;
* canonical structure;
* quality rules;
* quality evidence;
* quality gates;
* compliance;
* lifecycle requirements;

should be traceable to an identifiable framework revision.

---

### Evidence-Based Validation

Validation state SHALL reflect actual evidence.

A validation result SHALL NOT be recorded as `PASS` merely because a document expects or requires that validation.

Only actual execution, review, or other accepted evidence may convert a pending validation requirement into a successful validation result.

---

### Structural Consistency

The canonical documentation inventory SHALL remain synchronized across:

* `EPIC.yaml`;
* `MANIFEST.md`;
* `README.md`;
* `VALIDATION.md`;
* `CHANGELOG.md`;
* `Revision-History.md`;
* `EPIC-QLT-001.md`.

---

## Versioning Model

The Quality Framework uses semantic versioning principles for framework evolution.

```text
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
```

The interpretation is:

| Change                                  | Expected Version Impact             |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Breaking framework semantics            | MAJOR                               |
| Compatible framework capability         | MINOR                               |
| Correction or clarification             | PATCH                               |
| Post-publication metadata normalization | Usually no framework version change |
| Validation evidence refresh             | Usually no framework version change |

Version impact remains subject to FamilyOS release governance.

---

## Framework Version vs Repository Tag

The Quality Framework version and repository publication tag serve different purposes.

The framework version identifies the semantic version of the Quality Framework:

```text
1.0.0
```

The historical repository publication tag identifies the repository state under which that framework version was published:

```text
v4.6.0-quality-framework
```

These values SHALL NOT be assumed to use the same numbering scheme.

---

## Canonical Structure History

The current canonical Quality Framework structure consists of:

```text
26 numbered documents
+
7 control documents
=
33 canonical files
```

The canonical numbered sequence is:

```text
00 → 25
```

The seven control documents are:

```text
EPIC-QLT-001.md
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

This structure represents the authoritative current documentation organization for EPIC-QLT-001.

---

## Canonical Numbered Documents

The current numbered document sequence is:

```text
00-EPIC.md
01-Context.md
02-Vision.md
03-Quality-Principles.md
04-Quality-Architecture.md
05-Quality-Domains.md

## Revision Timeline

### Version 1.0.0 — Quality Framework Foundation

**Status:** Completed
**Historical Publication:** Published
**Historical Tag:** `v4.6.0-quality-framework`

Version `1.0.0` establishes the first complete canonical FamilyOS Quality Framework.

The framework defines:

* Quality Principles;
* Quality Architecture;
* Quality Domains;
* Quality Rule Model;
* Quality Profiles;
* Quality Metrics;
* Quality Evidence;
* Quality Risk Management;
* Defect and Quality Debt Management;
* Quality Reviews and Assessments;
* Quality Automation;
* Quality Observability;
* Quality Gates;
* Quality Compliance;
* Continuous Improvement;
* Quality Governance;
* Framework Lifecycle;
* Roadmap;
* Validation;
* Release;
* Implementation Planning.

The framework establishes quality as a continuous, evidence-based, explainable, measurable, risk-aware, and governed engineering capability.

---

## Version 1.0.0 Structural Baseline

The final canonical structural baseline for version `1.0.0` is:

| Category           |     Count |
| ------------------ | --------: |
| Numbered Documents |        26 |
| Control Documents  |         7 |
| Canonical Files    |        33 |
| Canonical Range    | `00 → 25` |

The canonical structure SHALL be treated as authoritative unless a future governed framework revision explicitly changes it.

---

## Historical Publication

Version `1.0.0` was historically published under:

```text
v4.6.0-quality-framework
```

The tag represents a historical repository state.

It is not a mutable pointer to the latest documentation corrections.

The publication relationship is therefore:

```text
Quality Framework 1.0.0
        ↓
Historical Repository Publication
        ↓
v4.6.0-quality-framework
```

---

## Historical Tag Immutability

The historical publication tag:

```text
v4.6.0-quality-framework
```

SHALL remain immutable.

Post-publication changes SHALL NOT:

* move the historical tag;
* delete and recreate the historical tag to reference a newer commit;
* reinterpret the tag as the current repository state;
* silently rewrite historical publication evidence.

Corrections after publication SHALL instead be represented by ordinary repository commits and, where required, a future governed release.

---

## Post-Publication Normalization

Following historical publication, the Quality Framework documentation may receive normalization changes that improve consistency without redefining the semantic identity of version `1.0.0`.

Examples include:

* canonical inventory synchronization;
* metadata normalization;
* validation evidence correction;
* formatting normalization;
* control-document synchronization;
* terminology corrections;
* stale-state removal;
* reference corrections;
* historical-state clarification.

Such changes do not automatically require modification of the historical publication tag.

---

## Post-Publication Revalidation

A post-publication revalidation is being performed against the current repository state.

The purpose of this revalidation is to confirm that the current Quality Framework documentation remains consistent with:

* the physical repository inventory;
* the canonical `00 → 25` structure;
* the seven control documents;
* current repository quality gates;
* framework boundaries;
* governance expectations;
* current validation evidence.

The revalidation does not rewrite historical publication history.

---

## Revalidation Scope

The post-publication revalidation includes:

```text
YAML Contract
Canonical Inventory
Filesystem Inventory
Numbering Integrity
Control Document Integrity
Empty File Detection
Reference Integrity
Semantic Consistency
Framework Boundary Review
Governance Consistency
Placeholder Review
Documentation Review
Ruff
MyPy
Pytest
Repository Diff Validation
Repository State Validation
```

Only checks supported by actual evidence SHALL be marked as passed.

---

## Current Structural Evidence

The current canonical inventory is:

```text
Numbered Documents: 26
Control Documents:  7
Canonical Files:    33
Canonical Range:    00 → 25
```

The authoritative machine-readable structure is maintained in:

```text
EPIC.yaml
```

The authoritative human-readable inventory is maintained in:

```text
MANIFEST.md
```

---

## Current Repository Quality Evidence

During the current post-publication revalidation, repository quality gates were executed against the current repository state.

The recorded execution produced:

```text
Ruff:
All checks passed!

MyPy:
Success: no issues found in 527 source files

Pytest:
1243 passed

git diff --check:
PASS
```

These results represent actual execution evidence from the current revalidation sequence.

They SHALL NOT be interpreted as evidence for unrelated repository revisions.

---

## Current Quality Gate State

| Quality Gate              | Current Evidence        |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Ruff                      | PASS                    |
| MyPy                      | PASS — 527 source files |
| Pytest                    | PASS — 1243 tests       |
| Repository Diff Check     | PASS                    |
| YAML Parse                | PASS                    |
| Canonical Inventory       | PASS                    |
| Filesystem Contract       | PASS                    |
| Numbering Integrity       | PASS                    |
| Control Document Presence | PASS                    |

Additional documentation and control-document synchronization work may still be required before the post-publication revalidation is formally closed.

---

## EPIC.yaml Normalization

During post-publication revalidation, `EPIC.yaml` was normalized to represent the current canonical Quality Framework contract.

The normalized contract defines:

```text
id: EPIC-QLT-001
version: 1.0.0
status: completed

numbered_documents: 26
canonical_document_range: 00-25
control_documents: 7
canonical_files: 33
```

The metadata also preserves the historical publication relationship:

```text
historical_tag: v4.6.0-quality-framework
publication_status: published
historical_tag_immutable: true
```

---

## MANIFEST.md Normalization

`MANIFEST.md` was synchronized with the canonical Quality Framework structure.

The manifest now records:

```text
26 numbered documents
7 control documents
33 canonical files
```

Its EPIC state is:

```text
Status: Completed
Version: 1.0.0
```

The manifest remains the authoritative human-readable inventory contract for the EPIC.

---

## EPIC-QLT-001.md Normalization

`EPIC-QLT-001.md` was synchronized with the completed framework state.

The document records:

* version `1.0.0`;
* status `Completed`;
* 26 numbered documents;
* seven control documents;
* 33 canonical files;
* historical publication under `v4.6.0-quality-framework`;
* historical tag immutability;
* the distinction between historical publication and current post-publication revalidation.

---

## Validation Evidence Policy

Validation evidence SHALL be revision-aware.

A quality gate result applies to the repository state against which it was executed.

For example:

```text
Repository Revision A
        ↓
Ruff PASS
MyPy PASS
Pytest PASS
```

does not automatically prove:

```text
Repository Revision B
        ↓
Ruff PASS
MyPy PASS
Pytest PASS
```

when revision B contains relevant changes.

Required validation SHALL be rerun when repository changes invalidate previous evidence.

---

## Validation State Semantics

The following state semantics apply.

### PASS

A required validation has been executed successfully and acceptable evidence exists.

### FAIL

A required validation has been executed and did not satisfy its acceptance criteria.

### PENDING

The validation has not yet been executed, completed, or formally evaluated.

### NOT APPLICABLE

The validation does not apply to the evaluated target and that determination is justified.

No validation state SHALL be promoted from `PENDING` to `PASS` without supporting evidence.

---

## Quality Framework Boundary Preservation

Revision activity SHALL preserve the Quality Framework's ownership boundaries.

The Quality Framework coordinates quality semantics but does not replace:

* Testing Framework responsibilities;
* Documentation Framework responsibilities;
* Build Framework responsibilities;
* Release Framework responsibilities;
* Plugin Compliance Framework responsibilities;
* specialized engineering tools.

Future revisions SHALL preserve these boundaries unless an explicit architectural decision changes them.

---

## Compatibility Expectations

Compatible framework revisions should preserve:

* canonical quality terminology;
* Quality Domain semantics;
* Quality Rule semantics;
* Quality Evidence traceability;
* Quality Assessment explainability;
* Quality Gate governance;
* explicit framework boundaries.

Breaking changes require explicit migration guidance.

---

## Governance of Revisions

Material revisions should identify:

* reason for change;
* affected documents;
* semantic impact;
* compatibility impact;
* validation requirements;
* migration requirements where applicable;
* release implications.

Revision governance SHALL distinguish between:

```text
Documentation Correction
Framework Clarification
Compatible Framework Evolution
Breaking Framework Evolution
Historical Publication
Post-Publication Revalidation
```

---

## Revision Classification

Quality Framework changes may be classified as follows.

### Editorial

Examples:

* spelling correction;
* formatting correction;
* grammar correction;
* non-semantic wording improvement.

Expected version impact:

```text
Usually none
```

---

### Documentation Normalization

Examples:

* control-document synchronization;
* canonical inventory correction;
* metadata normalization;
* stale-state removal.

Expected version impact:

```text
Usually none
```

provided framework semantics remain unchanged.

---

### Compatible Semantic Change

Examples:

* new optional quality capability;
* compatible rule metadata;
* additional assessment semantics;
* compatible governance extension.

Expected version impact:

```text
MINOR
```

---

### Breaking Semantic Change

Examples:

* incompatible Quality Rule semantics;
* incompatible evidence contract;
* incompatible gate decision semantics;
* removal of required framework capability.

Expected version impact:

```text
MAJOR
```

---

## Historical Record

The revision history SHALL preserve previous publication information even when later documentation improves the representation of that history.

Historical records SHOULD NOT be rewritten merely to make previous states appear identical to the current canonical state.

Where historical and current structures differ, the distinction should be recorded explicitly.

---

## Release Relationship

Framework revision and release governance interact as follows:

```text
Framework Change
        ↓
Revision Classification
        ↓
Validation
        ↓
Compatibility Assessment
        ↓
Release Readiness
        ↓
Publication Decision
```

The Release Framework remains authoritative for repository-wide release governance.

---

## Current Publication Relationship

The current relationship is:

```text
EPIC-QLT-001
Quality Framework
Version 1.0.0
Status: Completed
        ↓
Historical Publication
        ↓
v4.6.0-quality-framework
        ↓
Immutable Historical State
```

Current post-publication normalization exists after that historical publication and SHALL NOT change the historical tag.

---

## Current Revalidation Relationship

The current repository activity is represented separately:

```text
Historical Publication
v4.6.0-quality-framework
        ↓
Later Repository Evolution
        ↓
Quality Framework Control-Document Normalization
        ↓
Post-Publication Revalidation
        ↓
Current Validation Evidence
```

This preserves both historical integrity and current documentation accuracy.

---

## Revalidation Completion Requirements

The current post-publication revalidation may be considered complete when:

* `EPIC.yaml` is synchronized;
* `MANIFEST.md` is synchronized;
* `README.md` is synchronized;
* `CHANGELOG.md` is synchronized;
* `VALIDATION.md` is synchronized;
* `Revision-History.md` is synchronized;
* `EPIC-QLT-001.md` is synchronized;
* canonical inventory validation passes;
* reference validation passes;
* semantic consistency review passes;
* framework boundary review passes;
* governance review passes;
* required repository quality gates pass;
* final validation evidence is recorded.

---

## Future Revisions

Future Quality Framework revisions may introduce:

* executable Quality Rule models;
* machine-readable Quality Profiles;
* standardized evidence schemas;
* quality orchestration;
* tool adapters;
* Quality Assessment services;
* automated Quality Gates;
* Quality Risk services;
* defect services;
* quality debt services;
* compliance services;
* exception governance services;
* quality observability;
* historical metrics;
* cross-repository quality analysis;
* advanced quality intelligence.

Such revisions SHALL remain compatible with the framework's core principles unless explicitly released as breaking changes.

---

## AI Evolution

Future revisions may introduce AI-assisted capabilities for:

* explanation;
* summarization;
* investigation;
* historical analysis;
* recurring-pattern detection;
* recommendation;
* quality intelligence.

AI SHALL remain advisory unless a future governed revision explicitly establishes authoritative semantics.

Deterministic verification and explicit governance remain authoritative for:

* compliance;
* quality gates;
* exceptions;
* risk acceptance;
* release decisions.

---

## Revision Summary

The current Quality Framework revision state is:

```text

```

These results are associated with the current revalidation work and SHALL remain revision-aware.

---

## Final Revision Statement

EPIC-QLT-001 — Quality Framework version `1.0.0` establishes the canonical FamilyOS quality engineering foundation.

Its current canonical documentation structure consists of:

```text
26 numbered documents
7 control documents
33 canonical files
```

Version `1.0.0` was historically published under:

```text
v4.6.0-quality-framework
```

That historical publication tag is immutable.

Current post-publication normalization and revalidation improve the accuracy, consistency, and evidence quality of the Quality Framework control-document layer without rewriting the historical publication state.

Future revisions SHALL preserve traceability, explicit governance, validation integrity, framework boundaries, and historical publication integrity.
