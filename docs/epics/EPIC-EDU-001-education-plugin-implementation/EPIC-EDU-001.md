## 1. Purpose

EPIC-EDU-001 records the completed implementation of the official FamilyOS Education Plugin and establishes the governance record that was not present at the historical implementation release.

This EPIC does not rewrite the historical release. It documents and validates the already completed implementation represented by `v3.4.0-education-plugin-implementation`.

## 2. Historical Baselines

The Education Plugin documentation baseline is:

`v2.5.0-education-plugin`

Commit: `4179990637cd8d71451a6f9ce5995f84379bc9de`

The Education Plugin implementation baseline is:

`v3.4.0-education-plugin-implementation`

Commit: `3584d9391d214d5003fc5a906c6705e62df54f51`

No EPIC-EDU-001 document existed at the implementation tag.

## 3. Source RFC

The implementation is governed by RFC-0013 — Education Plugin.

The RFC documentation defines Education architecture, domain, generation, policies, rules, and validation semantics.

## 4. Implementation Scope

The historical implementation contains the official Education Plugin under:

`src/familyos_cli/plugins/builtin/education`

The implementation includes:

- plugin descriptor and runtime entry point;
- course, learner, and educational-record capabilities;
- Education domain models and domain service;
- course, learner, and educational-record models;
- policies, evaluator, and registry;
- profiles, registry, and resolver;
- documentation and domain generation recipes;
- rules, evaluator, and registry;
- Education templates;
- course, learner, record, and aggregate validation.

## 5. Validation Scope

Repository evidence includes dedicated unit and runtime tests for:

- capabilities;
- domain behavior;
- models;
- policies;
- profiles;
- recipes;
- rules;
- templates;
- validation;
- plugin runtime loading;
- runtime activation;
- capability runtime behavior;
- contribution behavior.

## 6. Historical Integrity

EPIC-EDU-001 must preserve:

- the RFC release tag;
- the implementation release tag;
- their associated commits;
- the fact that no Education implementation EPIC existed at the historical implementation release.

The retrospective EPIC must not move, replace, or reinterpret historical tags.

## 7. Governance Model

This directory contains seven control documents and no numbered documents.

The historical implementation remains authoritative evidence of implementation completion.

## 8. Completion

EPIC-EDU-001 is considered complete when:

- the seven control documents are present;
- historical baselines are verified;
- repository quality gates pass;
- control documents are aligned;
- remote publication is verified;
- the final repository state is clean;
- closure metadata records the completed state.
