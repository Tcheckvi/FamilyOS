## 1. Purpose

EPIC-DPL-001 records the completed implementation of the official FamilyOS Documents Plugin and establishes the governance record that was not present at the historical implementation release.

This EPIC does not reuse `EPIC-DOC-001`, which is reserved for the Documentation Framework.

This EPIC does not rewrite the historical release. It documents and validates the already completed implementation represented by `v3.5.0-documents-plugin`.

## 2. Historical Baselines

The Documents Plugin documentation baseline is:

`v2.6.0-documents-plugin`

Commit: `efd8ef94f5354e8757ecbd60af718dccf8aa180c`

The Documents Plugin implementation baseline is:

`v3.5.0-documents-plugin`

Commit: `935865417f851f15fc617a56da8d5230c0361f41`

No dedicated Documents Plugin implementation EPIC existed at the implementation tag.

## 3. Source RFC

The implementation is governed by RFC-0014 — Documents Plugin.

The repository contains both the original Documents Plugin RFC material and the later official Documents Plugin documentation set.

## 4. Implementation Scope

The historical implementation contains the official Documents Plugin under:

`src/familyos_cli/plugins/builtin/documents`

The implementation includes:

- plugin descriptor and runtime entry point;
- document capabilities;
- archive capability;
- document domain models and domain service;
- document models and versioning;
- policies and policy set;
- profiles, registry, and resolver;
- documentation recipe;
- rules and rule set;
- validation models and validator.

## 5. Validation Scope

Repository evidence includes dedicated unit and runtime tests for:

- capabilities;
- domain behavior;
- models;
- policies;
- profiles;
- recipes;
- rules;
- templates;
- validation;
- plugin runtime loading;
- runtime activation;
- capability runtime behavior;
- contribution runtime behavior.

## 6. Identifier Governance

`EPIC-DOC-001` is already assigned to the FamilyOS Documentation Framework.

The Documents Plugin implementation therefore uses:

`EPIC-DPL-001`

This avoids identifier collision while preserving the established Documentation Framework identity.

## 7. Historical Integrity

EPIC-DPL-001 must preserve:

- the RFC release tag;
- the implementation release tag;
- their associated commits;
- the absence of a dedicated Documents Plugin EPIC at the historical implementation release;
- the separate identity of `EPIC-DOC-001`.

## 8. Governance Model

This directory contains seven control documents and no numbered documents.

The historical implementation remains authoritative evidence of implementation completion.

## 9. Completion

EPIC-DPL-001 is considered complete when:

- the seven control documents are present;
- historical baselines are verified;
- repository quality gates pass;
- control documents are aligned;
- remote publication is verified;
- the final repository state is clean;
- closure metadata records the completed state.
