# Build Framework

## 15 Build Validation

### Overview

EPIC-BLD-001 — Build Framework defines how FamilyOS determines whether a build, its execution context, and its resulting artifacts satisfy the requirements necessary to establish build trust.

Build Validation is the assurance layer of the Build Framework.

Its purpose is not merely to detect whether a build command returned successfully.

Its purpose is to determine whether the build process and resulting outputs are sufficiently correct, complete, consistent, traceable, and policy-compliant for their intended use.

The central principle is:

> A build becomes trustworthy only after the relevant inputs, execution, artifacts, and evidence have been validated.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of Build Validation is to provide a consistent model for verifying:

* build inputs;
* build configuration;
* dependency state;
* toolchain state;
* environment state;
* build execution;
* artifact structure;
* artifact metadata;
* artifact integrity;
* artifact installability;
* policy compliance;
* evidence completeness;
* release readiness.

Build Validation transforms build completion into engineering confidence.

---

## Validation Philosophy

FamilyOS distinguishes between three fundamentally different states.

```text id="f1z4xl"
Build Requested
      ↓
Build Completed
      ↓
Build Validated
```

Only the final state can establish sufficient trust for downstream use.

A successful process exit alone is insufficient.

---

## Validation Model

The canonical Build Validation model is:

```text id="kyfghd"
Input Validation
      ↓
Context Validation
      ↓
Environment Validation
      ↓
Execution Validation
      ↓
Artifact Validation
      ↓
Evidence Validation
      ↓
Policy Validation
      ↓
Trusted Build Result
```

Each validation layer addresses a different source of uncertainty.

---

## Validation Objectives

Build Validation should determine:

* whether required build state exists;
* whether resolved state is internally consistent;
* whether execution occurred under supported conditions;
* whether candidate artifacts satisfy expected structure;
* whether artifacts correspond to declared metadata;
* whether artifact integrity can be established;
* whether required engineering checks succeeded;
* whether required evidence is available;
* whether downstream handoff is permitted.

---

## Validation Principle 1 — Validation Before Trust

No candidate artifact may become trusted solely because it was generated successfully.

The required relationship is:

```text id="5gtz5l"
Generated Artifact
       ↓
Validation
       ↓
Trusted Artifact
```

This is one of the foundational Build Framework invariants.

---

## Validation Principle 2 — Validate As Early As Possible

Problems should be detected at the earliest meaningful stage.

The preferred model is:

```text id="o3ox8q"
Invalid Input
      ↓
Early Validation Failure
```

rather than:

```text id="icm04f"
Invalid Input
      ↓
Long Build
      ↓
Artifact Creation
      ↓
Late Failure
```

Early validation improves both reliability and efficiency.

---

## Validation Principle 3 — Validation Must Be Layered

No single check provides sufficient assurance.

For example:

```text id="kbptc7"
Tests Pass
```

does not necessarily prove:

* packaging correctness;
* artifact integrity;
* metadata correctness;
* dependency reproducibility;
* release readiness.

Validation must therefore operate across layers.

---

## Validation Principle 4 — Validation Must Be Profile-Aware

Different build profiles may require different levels of validation.

For example:

```text id="1jk6gt"
Development
    ↓
Essential Validation

CI
    ↓
Standard Validation

Release Candidate
    ↓
Strict Validation
```

The profile must determine validation requirements explicitly.

---

## Validation Principle 5 — Validation Results Must Be Observable

A validation system must expose:

* what was checked;
* whether it passed;
* what failed;
* why it failed;
* what evidence supports the result.

Opaque validation weakens trust.

---

## Validation Principle 6 — Failed Validation Must Prevent Trust

Required validation failure MUST block trusted artifact declaration.

The framework rejects:

```text id="j72fxq"
Validation Failed
      ↓
Warning Only
      ↓
Continue To Release
```

for mandatory validation.

---

## Validation Principle 7 — Validation Must Be Repeatable

Equivalent build contexts should produce equivalent validation outcomes.

Validation itself should avoid uncontrolled environmental variability.

---

## Validation Principle 8 — Validation Must Remain Independent Of Release Authority

Build Validation determines whether an artifact meets build requirements.

It does not decide whether the artifact should become an official release.

The boundary remains:

```text id="7krws2"
Build Validation
       ↓
Trusted Build Artifact
       ↓
Release Decision
```

---

## Validation Domains

FamilyOS Build Validation covers several domains.

```text id="bsw4xo"
Build Validation
│
├── Input Validation
├── Configuration Validation
├── Dependency Validation
├── Toolchain Validation
├── Environment Validation
├── Execution Validation
├── Artifact Validation
├── Metadata Validation
├── Integrity Validation
├── Functional Artifact Validation
├── Evidence Validation
├── Policy Validation
└── Release Readiness Validation
```

---

## Input Validation

Input Validation confirms that required build inputs exist and satisfy basic requirements.

Inputs may include:

* source;
* configuration;
* dependency definitions;
* schemas;
* templates;
* metadata;
* generated prerequisites.

---

## Input Presence Validation

Required inputs must exist.

Examples include:

* source package;
* build configuration;
* package metadata;
* dependency declaration;
* plugin metadata.

Missing required input must fail before execution.

---

## Input Syntax Validation

Structured inputs should be syntactically valid.

Examples include:

* TOML;
* YAML;
* JSON;
* Python;
* manifest formats.

---

## Input Structural Validation

Input structure may be validated for expected layout.

Examples include:

* required package directories;
* plugin structure;
* required metadata sections;
* required documentation structure.

---

## Input Semantic Validation

Semantically invalid input must fail even when syntax is valid.

For example:

```text id="0p7j5y"
version = "invalid-version-format"
```

may parse correctly but violate artifact requirements.

---

## Input Freshness Validation

Generated inputs may require freshness checks.

A stale generated file may cause build output to diverge from authoritative source.

Where relevant, validation may verify:

```text id="6qa3ws"
Authoritative Input
       ↓
Expected Generated State
       ↓
Current Generated State
```

---

## Configuration Validation

Configuration validation ensures that effective build configuration is valid and internally consistent.

It may include:

* profile validation;
* required settings;
* precedence resolution;
* unsupported values;
* conflicting settings;
* policy restrictions.

---

## Effective Configuration Validation

The final resolved configuration should be validated, not merely individual source files.

The relationship is:

```text id="8zsgcn"
Configuration Sources
        ↓
Resolution
        ↓
Effective Configuration
        ↓
Validation
```

---

## Profile Validation

The selected build profile must:

* exist;
* support the requested target;
* activate valid settings;
* satisfy required policy.

---

## Configuration Conflict Validation

Ambiguous or contradictory configuration should fail explicitly.

---

## Dependency Validation

Dependency Validation ensures that dependency state is suitable for build execution.

This may include:

* declaration presence;
* resolution success;
* compatibility;
* lock consistency;
* package availability;
* policy compliance;
* integrity verification.

---

## Dependency Resolution Validation

The resolved dependency graph must satisfy applicable constraints.

Unresolved conflicts must prevent build execution or trust.

---

## Dependency Lock Validation

When lock state is required, validation should confirm that:

* lock data is current;
* lock data matches declarations;
* the resolved state conforms to lock requirements.

---

## Dependency Compatibility Validation

Dependencies must be compatible with:

* runtime;
* platform;
* each other;
* FamilyOS source;
* build tooling.

---

## Dependency Security Validation

Dependency security findings may participate in validation.

The exact blocking policy remains aligned with Security and Quality governance.

---

## Toolchain Validation

Toolchain Validation confirms that required tools are present and supported.

Examples include:

* Python runtime;
* package builder;
* build backend;
* generator;
* Ruff;
* MyPy;
* Pytest.

---

## Tool Version Validation

Critical tool versions should be validated where they affect build trust.

The model is:

```text id="7tzln5"
Required Version Policy
        ↓
Detected Version
        ↓
Compatibility Decision
```

---

## Tool Configuration Validation

A supported tool with invalid configuration may still produce invalid behavior.

Tool configuration must therefore also participate in validation.

---

## Environment Validation

Environment Validation verifies that the execution environment satisfies required conditions.

This may include:

* runtime;
* platform;
* architecture;
* filesystem;
* permissions;
* environment variables;
* network requirements;
* isolation expectations.

---

## Clean Environment Validation

Release-oriented builds may require stronger environment cleanliness.

Examples include:

* fresh workspace;
* no stale artifacts;
* no prohibited generated state;
* no unknown local modification.

---

## Source State Validation

Some profiles may validate source control state.

Possible checks include:

* current commit;
* clean working tree;
* no required untracked input;
* known repository revision.

---

## Execution Validation

Execution Validation determines whether required build stages completed successfully and coherently.

This may include:

* successful exit codes;
* required stage completion;
* output production;
* absence of fatal warnings;
* expected side-effect boundaries.

---

## Stage Completion Validation

A build stage should not be considered successful merely because a later stage executed.

Required stage status should be explicit.

---

## Execution Ordering Validation

Where stage order matters, the canonical order should be enforced.

---

## Side Effect Validation

Build execution may be checked for unintended changes to authoritative source.

For example:

```text id="8chij0"
Repository Before Build
        ↓
Build
        ↓
Repository After Build
        ↓
Unexpected Tracked Change?
```

Unexpected mutation may indicate build drift.

---

## Artifact Validation

Artifact Validation is one of the most important Build Validation domains.

It determines whether generated candidate artifacts conform to expected structure and semantics.

---

## Artifact Presence Validation

Required artifacts must exist.

If a build expects:

```text id="bq5x9q"
Wheel
Source Distribution
```

and only one is produced, the build may be incomplete.

---

## Artifact Count Validation

Unexpected duplicate or missing artifacts may indicate configuration problems.

The expected artifact set should remain explicit.

---

## Artifact Naming Validation

Artifact names should conform to:

* ecosystem standards;
* project naming;
* version context;
* platform tags where relevant.

Invalid naming may affect installation or release processes.

---

## Artifact Structure Validation

Artifact internal structure may be validated.

For Python packages this may include:

* package directories;
* metadata directories;
* required files;
* resource inclusion.

---

## Artifact Content Validation

Artifact contents should match intended packaging rules.

Validation should detect accidental inclusion of:

* secrets;
* caches;
* local environment files;
* unrelated repository content;
* temporary build files.

---

## Artifact Metadata Validation

Artifact metadata must match authoritative project state.

Possible checks include:

* package name;
* version;
* dependencies;
* runtime requirement;
* classifiers;
* plugin metadata.

---

## Metadata Consistency Validation

If the same property exists in multiple layers, values must remain consistent.

For example:

```text id="d1kp2o"
Project Version
     =
Artifact Version
```

where applicable.

---

## Artifact Integrity Validation

Artifact integrity ensures that artifact bytes correspond to recorded integrity information.

This may include checksums.

---

## Checksum Generation

Integrity digests should be calculated only after final artifact bytes are stable.

```text id="twgzqj"
Final Artifact Bytes
       ↓
Digest
       ↓
Recorded Integrity
```

---

## Checksum Verification

Downstream validation may recompute and compare the digest.

A mismatch MUST invalidate trust.

---

## Functional Artifact Validation

Some artifacts should be tested as artifacts rather than only as source.

This may include:

* clean installation;
* import smoke test;
* executable command test;
* plugin discovery;
* documentation rendering.

---

## Clean Installation Validation

A Python artifact may be installed into a fresh environment to verify that packaging is complete.

This catches problems that source-level tests may miss.

---

## Import Validation

After installation, key modules may be imported to detect:

* missing files;
* dependency metadata problems;
* package-discovery errors.

---

## CLI Smoke Validation

Where appropriate, the packaged CLI may be invoked minimally to verify entry points.

For example:

```text id="0fnfwg"
familyos --help
```

as an illustrative smoke test.

The exact command is implementation-specific.

---

## Plugin Artifact Validation

Official plugin artifacts may require:

* metadata validation;
* capability validation;
* structural validation;
* compliance validation;
* import validation;
* package inclusion validation.

---

## Documentation Artifact Validation

Documentation artifacts may require:

* generated file presence;
* internal-link checks;
* index completeness;
* metadata consistency;
* rendering validation.

---

## Source Distribution Validation

Source distributions may require validation that they contain enough authoritative state to rebuild or install correctly.

This may include:

* project metadata;
* source;
* build configuration;
* required resources.

---

## Wheel Validation

Wheel validation may include:

* archive structure;
* metadata;
* tags;
* package content;
* installation.

---

## Evidence Validation

Build evidence itself must be checked for completeness and consistency.

A build should not claim strong trust while required evidence is missing.

---

## Evidence Completeness

Required evidence may include:

* Build ID;
* source revision;
* dependency state;
* toolchain state;
* artifact manifest;
* integrity digest;
* validation result.

Evidence requirements depend on profile.

---

## Evidence Consistency

Evidence must refer to the correct build and artifact set.

For example:

```text id="r9q7c6"
Build ID In Report
       =
Build ID Associated With Artifact
```

---

## Evidence Integrity

Future stronger evidence may itself require integrity protection.

This becomes more relevant with provenance or signing.

---

## Policy Validation

Policy Validation evaluates build state against FamilyOS governance rules.

Policy sources may include:

* Quality Framework;
* Security Architecture;
* Plugin Compliance Framework;
* Release Framework;
* engineering governance.

---

## Quality Gate Integration

Build Validation may participate in quality gates.

A conceptual model is:

```text id="f71ypd"
Build Validation Results
          ↓
Quality Gate
          ↓
Pass / Fail
```

The Quality Framework owns the broader gate policy.

---

## Security Gate Integration

Security-sensitive builds may require checks for:

* vulnerable dependencies;
* secret leakage;
* artifact integrity;
* prohibited tooling;
* untrusted sources.

---

## Plugin Compliance Integration

Plugin builds may require compliance results before artifacts become trusted.

The Build Framework consumes compliance evidence.

It does not redefine compliance rules.

---

## Release Readiness Validation

Build Validation may determine whether a trusted artifact satisfies the Build Framework side of release readiness.

This does not authorize release.

It answers:

```text id="308hut"
Does this artifact satisfy the required build conditions for release consideration?
```

---

## Release Readiness Inputs

Release-readiness validation may consider:

* profile;
* source state;
* dependency state;
* toolchain;
* environment;
* artifact validation;
* integrity;
* evidence completeness.

---

## Validation Profiles

Validation requirements vary by build profile.

---

## Development Validation Profile

Development validation may prioritize rapid feedback.

Possible checks include:

* configuration;
* essential dependencies;
* basic build execution;
* artifact presence;
* basic artifact validation.

---

## Validation Build Profile

A dedicated validation profile may execute:

* Ruff;
* MyPy;
* Pytest;
* packaging checks;
* structural checks.

---

## CI Validation Profile

CI may require:

* canonical environment;
* static validation;
* tests;
* build;
* artifact validation;
* evidence generation.

---

## Release Candidate Validation Profile

Release-candidate validation SHOULD apply the strongest current Build Framework controls.

A conceptual flow is:

```text id="n0g5vn"
Source State Validation
        ↓
Configuration Validation
        ↓
Dependency Validation
        ↓
Toolchain Validation
        ↓
Environment Validation
        ↓
Build Execution
        ↓
Artifact Validation
        ↓
Integrity Validation
        ↓
Evidence Validation
        ↓
Release Readiness
```

---

## Validation Strictness

Validation strictness should increase with artifact importance.

The principle is:

```text id="mr17kv"
Higher Downstream Impact
         ↓
Stronger Validation
```

---

## Validation Result

A validation process should produce an explicit result.

A conceptual model is:

```text id="o82e64"
ValidationResult
│
├── Build ID
├── Validation Profile
├── Status
├── Checks
├── Failures
├── Warnings
└── Evidence
```

A formal object may be introduced later.

---

## Validation Status

Possible conceptual statuses include:

```text id="eo74g3"
NOT_RUN
RUNNING
PASSED
FAILED
SKIPPED
```

Required checks must not be silently marked as skipped.

---

## Required Versus Optional Validation

Validation checks may be:

```text id="z9rqz4"
REQUIRED
OPTIONAL
INFORMATIONAL
```

The classification must be explicit.

---

## Required Validation Failure

A required check failure MUST make the overall validation fail.

---

## Optional Validation Failure

Optional validation may produce warnings without blocking trust.

Use of optional checks should remain intentional.

---

## Validation Warnings

Warnings should indicate conditions that deserve attention but do not invalidate the current profile.

Too many permanent warnings reduce signal quality.

Persistent warnings should be reviewed.

---

## Validation Exceptions

Temporary exceptions may sometimes be necessary.

An exception SHOULD include:

* reason;
* scope;
* owner;
* expiration or review expectation;
* risk.

Exceptions must not become permanent undocumented bypasses.

---

## Validation Bypass

High-trust profiles SHOULD NOT allow arbitrary validation bypass.

If a required validation is intentionally bypassed, trust state must reflect the exception and governance must approve it where appropriate.

---

## Validation Ordering

Checks should be ordered to maximize early feedback.

A practical order is:

```text id="faiwcy"
Cheap Validation
      ↓
Structural Validation
      ↓
Static Validation
      ↓
Tests
      ↓
Build
      ↓
Artifact Validation
```

The exact ordering depends on workflow.

---

## Validation Cost

Some checks are expensive.

Validation strategy should balance:

* feedback speed;
* confidence;
* resource cost.

High-cost validation may be reserved for CI or release profiles.

---

## Validation Parallelization

Independent checks may execute in parallel.

Parallelization must not change semantics.

The result must remain equivalent to sequential validation.

---

## Validation Caching

Some validation results may be cached when their relevant inputs are unchanged.

Caching must be safe and input-aware.

A stale validation cache must not create false trust.

---

## Validation Reuse

A validated artifact may carry forward its validation state if its bytes and associated context remain unchanged.

The preferred model is:

```text id="j5d9c4"
Validate Once
      ↓
Preserve Same Artifact
      ↓
Promote
```

This supports build-once-promote principles.

---

## Validation Invalidation

Validation must be considered invalid if relevant state changes.

Examples include:

* artifact bytes;
* source;
* dependencies;
* toolchain;
* relevant configuration.

---

## Validation And Immutability

Artifact immutability allows validation results to remain meaningful.

If an artifact changes, it must be revalidated.

---

## Validation Evidence

Validation results themselves are part of Build Evidence.

Useful evidence may include:

* check name;
* status;
* timestamp;
* tool;
* tool version;
* diagnostics;
* related artifact.

---

## Validation Reports

A build may generate a validation report.

A conceptual report may contain:

```text id="cpv2ov"
Build Validation Report
│
├── Build Identity
├── Profile
├── Input Checks
├── Environment Checks
├── Execution Checks
├── Artifact Checks
├── Policy Checks
└── Final Decision
```

---

## Human-Readable Validation Output

Validation results should remain understandable to developers.

Humans should not need to decode raw machine output for routine failures.

---

## Machine-Readable Validation Output

Future automation may benefit from structured results.

Possible formats include:

* JSON;
* structured manifests;
* CI annotations.

A structured format should be introduced when useful.

---

## Validation Failure Diagnostics

A good validation failure should explain:

* what failed;
* why;
* where;
* expected condition;
* observed condition;
* corrective direction.

---

## Validation Failure Categories

Possible conceptual categories include:

```text id="7nwb7a"
INPUT_VALIDATION_FAILURE
CONFIGURATION_VALIDATION_FAILURE
DEPENDENCY_VALIDATION_FAILURE
TOOLCHAIN_VALIDATION_FAILURE
ENVIRONMENT_VALIDATION_FAILURE
EXECUTION_VALIDATION_FAILURE
ARTIFACT_VALIDATION_FAILURE
INTEGRITY_VALIDATION_FAILURE
EVIDENCE_VALIDATION_FAILURE
POLICY_VALIDATION_FAILURE
```

Formal machine-readable categories may come later.

---

## Validation Fail-Fast

Certain failures should stop validation immediately.

Examples include:

* invalid configuration;
* missing build target;
* unsupported runtime.

Continuing may provide little value.

---

## Validation Continue-On-Failure

Independent checks may sometimes continue to collect a broader defect picture.

This is useful for:

* CI diagnostics;
* quality reviews.

The policy should be explicit.

---

## Validation And Testing Framework

Testing is an important validation contributor.

However, Build Validation does not redefine testing architecture.

The relationship is:

```text id="vqdcwk"
Build Validation
      ↓
Request Applicable Tests
      ↓
Testing Framework
      ↓
Test Evidence
      ↓
Build Validation Decision
```

---

## Validation And Quality Framework

The Quality Framework may consume Build Validation evidence.

Examples include:

* build pass rate;
* artifact validation results;
* reproducibility;
* validation completeness.

---

## Validation And Documentation Framework

Build documentation and generated documentation may require validation according to Documentation Framework standards.

---

## Validation And Security Architecture

Security validation may include:

* dependency findings;
* secret checks;
* integrity checks;
* toolchain policy.

Security policy remains governed outside Build Framework.

---

## Validation And Release Framework

The Release Framework consumes trusted artifacts and validation evidence.

The handoff may include:

```text id="6l9641"
Build ID
Artifact Set
Integrity
Validation Result
Evidence
```

Release retains authority to reject even a valid build.

---

## Validation And Automation

CI should execute canonical validation rather than duplicate validation logic independently.

The preferred model is:

```text id="9s5pgv"
Validation Definition
        ↓
Local / CI Execution
```

---

## Validation And Developer Workflow

Developers should be able to run relevant validation locally before pushing changes.

This improves feedback and reduces CI-only failures.

---

## Pre-Commit Validation

Some low-cost validation may occur before commit.

Examples include:

* linting;
* formatting checks;
* fast unit tests.

The Build Framework does not mandate a specific Git hook implementation.

---

## Pre-Push Validation

Developers may run broader validation before pushing.

The canonical build model should support this without requiring CI-only mechanisms.

---

## Validation Observability

Useful validation metrics may include:

* total checks;
* passed checks;
* failed checks;
* skipped checks;
* validation duration;
* failure categories.

---

## Validation Metrics

Potential quality metrics include:

```text id="zwvcmt"
Validation Pass Rate
Artifact Validation Failure Rate
Environment Validation Failure Rate
Dependency Validation Failure Rate
```

The Quality Framework governs formal metric use.

---

## Validation Duration

Validation duration may be tracked to identify expensive stages.

Optimization must not weaken confidence.

---

## Validation Stability

Flaky validation is harmful because it weakens trust.

A required check should behave deterministically under equivalent conditions.

---

## Flaky Test Integration

If tests used for build validation are flaky, the problem must be addressed in the Testing Framework.

Retries must not become a permanent substitute for deterministic testing.

---

## Reproducibility Validation

FamilyOS may eventually validate reproducibility by building equivalent contexts multiple times and comparing outputs.

Conceptually:

```text id="yyvpcy"
Build A
   ↓
Artifact A

Build B
   ↓
Artifact B

Artifact A
   ↓
Compare
   ↑
Artifact B
```

Differences should be explainable.

---

## Reproducibility Validation Levels

Possible maturity levels include:

```text id="9k2e2x"
Process Repeatability
Environment Repeatability
Dependency Repeatability
Artifact Equivalence
Bit-For-Bit Reproducibility
```

Not all levels are immediate requirements.

---

## Artifact Comparison Validation

Artifact comparison may examine:

* checksum;
* size;
* metadata;
* file list;
* archive structure.

This can help identify unexpected toolchain or dependency drift.

---

## Validation Security

Validation tooling itself must be trusted.

A compromised validation tool can falsely approve invalid artifacts.

Toolchain governance therefore applies to validators.

---

## Validation Least Privilege

Validation should not require release publication credentials.

Checks should operate with minimal privileges.

---

## Secret Safety

Validation output must not expose secrets discovered in configuration or environment.

---

## Validation Tamper Resistance

Future high-trust workflows may protect validation reports from modification.

This becomes relevant when formal provenance or attestations are introduced.

---

## Validation Governance

Significant validation-policy changes may require formal review.

Examples include:

* removing mandatory checks;
* weakening release-candidate validation;
* changing artifact integrity requirements;
* changing dependency security thresholds;
* introducing signed validation attestations.

---

## Validation Rule Ownership

Validation rules should remain owned by the appropriate framework.

Conceptually:

```text id="4of27d"
Build Structural Rule
      → Build Framework

Testing Rule
      → Testing Framework

Quality Threshold
      → Quality Framework

Security Rule
      → Security Architecture

Plugin Compliance Rule
      → Plugin Compliance Framework
```

Build Validation orchestrates applicable rules without absorbing all ownership.

---

## Validation Change Management

Changes should follow:

```text id="g24t5n"
Requirement Change
      ↓
Validation Rule Update
      ↓
Tooling Update
      ↓
Test Validation
      ↓
Documentation Update
      ↓
Adoption
```

---

## Validation Technical Debt

Validation debt includes:

* permanently skipped checks;
* obsolete rules;
* ignored warnings;
* duplicate CI checks;
* flaky tests;
* missing artifact validation;
* outdated validation tooling.

This debt weakens confidence and should be reduced.

---

## Validation Anti-Pattern — Tests Are Enough

Passing tests does not guarantee artifact correctness.

---

## Validation Anti-Pattern — Build Exit Code Is Enough

A successful build command does not establish artifact trust.

---

## Validation Anti-Pattern — Manual Inspection Only

Manual inspection may supplement validation.

It must not be the sole canonical mechanism for routine requirements that can be automated.

---

## Validation Anti-Pattern — CI-Only Validation Logic

Required validation semantics should not exist only inside one CI provider configuration.

---

## Validation Anti-Pattern — Permanent Skip

A required validation that is permanently skipped is effectively not a requirement.

---

## Validation Anti-Pattern — Warning Flood

A validation system that emits large numbers of routinely ignored warnings loses effectiveness.

---

## Validation Anti-Pattern — Rebuild To Validate

Where possible, validate the artifact intended for promotion rather than rebuilding a separate artifact for validation.

---

## Validation Maturity Model

FamilyOS Build Validation may evolve through:

```text id="x3gh1k"
Level 1
Manual Validation

    ↓

Level 2
Documented Validation

    ↓

Level 3
Automated Source Validation

    ↓

Level 4
Artifact Validation

    ↓

Level 5
Evidence-Aware Validation

    ↓

Level 6
Reproducibility Validation

    ↓

Level 7
Policy-Driven Validation

    ↓

Level 8
Attested Validation
```

Each stage should be introduced according to actual platform needs.

---

## Validation Success Criteria

The Build Validation model is successful when FamilyOS can answer:

1. which validation checks apply to a build;
2. which profile selected them;
3. whether build inputs were valid;
4. whether configuration was valid;
5. whether dependencies were valid;
6. whether toolchain requirements were satisfied;
7. whether the environment was supported;
8. whether execution completed correctly;
9. whether required artifacts were produced;
10. whether artifact structure and metadata were valid;
11. whether artifact integrity was established;
12. whether artifact-level functional checks succeeded;
13. whether required evidence exists;
14. whether applicable policies passed;
15. why any validation failed;
16. whether the artifact satisfies build-side release readiness.

---

## Validation Invariants

The following invariants should remain true.

### Invariant 1

Required validation must occur before trusted artifact declaration.

### Invariant 2

Mandatory validation failure must prevent build trust.

### Invariant 3

Validation requirements must be explicit per build profile.

### Invariant 4

Artifact validation must validate the actual artifact intended for downstream use.

### Invariant 5

Validation evidence must remain associated with the correct build.

### Invariant 6

Validation must not rely on undocumented CI-only behavior.

### Invariant 7

Changing trusted artifact bytes invalidates prior artifact validation.

### Invariant 8

Release authority remains outside Build Validation.

### Invariant 9

Validation tooling must itself remain governed.

### Invariant 10

Validation failures must remain observable and explainable.

## Canonical Validation Flow

The FamilyOS Build Validation flow can be summarized as:

```text id="9cdqdf"
Validate Inputs
      ↓
Validate Configuration
      ↓
Validate Dependencies
      ↓
Validate Toolchain
      ↓
Validate Environment
      ↓
Execute Build
      ↓
Validate Execution
      ↓
Validate Artifact Set
      ↓
Validate Metadata
      ↓
Validate Integrity
      ↓
Validate Functional Artifact Behavior
      ↓
Validate Evidence
      ↓
Evaluate Policies
      ↓
Declare Build Trust
```

This sequence converts successful build execution into evidence-backed engineering confidence.

## Final Principle

The FamilyOS Build Validation model is founded on the following rule:

> FamilyOS must never trust an artifact because the build appeared successful; it must trust an artifact because the relevant evidence demonstrates that the build and artifact satisfied their required conditions.

Validation is therefore not an optional final check.

It is the mechanism through which the Build Framework converts transformation into trust.

Without validation, FamilyOS has output.

With validation, traceability, integrity, and evidence, FamilyOS has a trusted build artifact.
