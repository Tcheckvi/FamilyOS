# Build Framework

## 04 Build Architecture

### Overview

EPIC-BLD-001 — Build Framework defines the canonical architecture through which FamilyOS engineering inputs are transformed into validated and trusted artifacts.

The Build Architecture establishes the structural model of the build capability.

It defines:

* architectural layers;
* build responsibilities;
* execution boundaries;
* input and output contracts;
* environment relationships;
* configuration flow;
* dependency flow;
* artifact production;
* validation;
* evidence generation;
* automation integration;
* release handoff.

The architecture is intentionally defined independently from any single implementation tool.

Its purpose is to provide a stable model that remains valid even when specific build technologies evolve.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of the Build Architecture is to ensure that FamilyOS build capabilities do not emerge as a collection of unrelated scripts, commands, CI jobs, packaging utilities, and local conventions.

Instead, build behavior must follow an explicit architectural model.

The architecture provides a common answer to the question:

```text
How does FamilyOS transform controlled engineering state into trusted build artifacts?
```

The answer is expressed through clearly separated responsibilities.

---

## Architectural Objective

The primary architectural objective is to transform:

```text
Controlled Engineering Inputs
```

into:

```text
Trusted Build Artifacts
```

through an explicit sequence of controlled stages.

The canonical model is:

```text
Inputs
  ↓
Context Resolution
  ↓
Environment Validation
  ↓
Build Preparation
  ↓
Build Execution
  ↓
Artifact Production
  ↓
Artifact Validation
  ↓
Evidence Generation
  ↓
Trusted Artifact
```

Each stage has a distinct responsibility.

---

## Architectural Principles

The Build Architecture follows the principles defined in `03-Build-Principles.md`.

In particular, the architecture must preserve:

* explicit inputs;
* reproducibility;
* deterministic behavior where feasible;
* traceability;
* separation of responsibilities;
* automation compatibility;
* validation before trust;
* artifact identity;
* evidence generation;
* governance.

These principles constrain implementation decisions.

---

## Architectural Layers

The FamilyOS Build Architecture is organized into conceptual layers.

```text
Build Architecture
│
├── Interface Layer
├── Input Layer
├── Context Resolution Layer
├── Environment Layer
├── Orchestration Layer
├── Execution Layer
├── Artifact Layer
├── Validation Layer
├── Evidence Layer
└── Integration Layer
```

These layers are conceptual.

A concrete implementation may combine them physically while preserving their responsibilities.

---

## Layer 1 — Build Interface

The Build Interface provides the entry point through which humans or automation request build operations.

Possible interfaces include:

* CLI commands;
* task runner commands;
* Python entry points;
* CI jobs;
* release preparation workflows.

The interface should expose stable build semantics.

---

## Interface Responsibilities

The Build Interface is responsible for:

* accepting a build request;
* selecting a build profile;
* accepting explicit parameters;
* communicating build intent;
* initiating orchestration;
* returning meaningful results.

It should not contain hidden build architecture.

---

## Interface Model

```text
Developer / CI / Release Process
              ↓
       Build Interface
              ↓
     Build Orchestration
```

The same architectural build model should be accessible from multiple execution contexts.

---

## Layer 2 — Build Input Layer

The Build Input Layer identifies the engineering state capable of influencing build output.

Inputs may include:

* source code;
* package metadata;
* project configuration;
* schemas;
* templates;
* generated sources;
* resources;
* dependency declarations;
* lock files;
* build configuration;
* policy definitions;
* artifact definitions.

The input layer must distinguish authoritative inputs from temporary state.

---

## Input Categories

FamilyOS build inputs can be grouped into several categories.

```text
Build Inputs
│
├── Source Inputs
├── Configuration Inputs
├── Dependency Inputs
├── Generated Inputs
├── Toolchain Inputs
├── Environment Inputs
└── Policy Inputs
```

This classification improves traceability and validation.

---

## Source Inputs

Source inputs include repository-controlled engineering content such as:

* Python source;
* plugin source;
* package source;
* documentation sources;
* schemas;
* templates;
* static resources.

Source inputs should normally be associated with repository state.

---

## Configuration Inputs

Configuration inputs influence build behavior.

Examples include:

* project configuration;
* packaging configuration;
* build profiles;
* feature flags;
* generation settings;
* tool configuration.

Configuration should be explicit and version-controlled where practical.

---

## Dependency Inputs

Dependency inputs define the external software required for the build.

They include:

* direct dependencies;
* development dependencies;
* build dependencies;
* validation dependencies;
* dependency lock information.

Resolved dependency state may become part of build evidence.

---

## Generated Inputs

Some build processes consume generated content.

Generated inputs must have defined origin and generation rules.

The build architecture must avoid circular ambiguity such as:

```text
Generated Output
      ↓
Unknown Generator State
      ↓
Build Input
```

Generated inputs should be reproducible or traceable.

---

## Toolchain Inputs

The build toolchain influences build semantics.

Examples include:

* Python runtime;
* build frontend;
* build backend;
* package manager;
* generators;
* validation tools.

Significant toolchain state should be identifiable.

---

## Environment Inputs

Environment state may influence build behavior.

Examples include:

* operating system;
* architecture;
* environment variables;
* filesystem state;
* permissions;
* locale;
* network availability.

The architecture should minimize uncontrolled environmental influence.

---

## Policy Inputs

Build behavior may be constrained by FamilyOS engineering policies.

These may originate from:

* Quality Framework;
* Security Architecture;
* Plugin Compliance Framework;
* Release Framework;
* repository governance.

Policies influence validation and release readiness.

---

## Layer 3 — Build Context Resolution

The Build Context Resolution Layer transforms raw inputs into an explicit effective build context.

This layer answers:

```text
What exactly will influence this build?
```

A resolved context may include:

```text
Build Context
│
├── Source Revision
├── Working Tree State
├── Build Profile
├── Build Configuration
├── Dependency State
├── Toolchain State
├── Environment State
├── Policy State
└── Artifact Expectations
```

The context should be inspectable where practical.

---

## Build Context Identity

A significant build should eventually be associated with a build identifier.

The identifier connects:

```text
Build ID
  │
  ├── Context
  ├── Execution
  ├── Artifacts
  └── Evidence
```

The exact identifier format is implementation-specific.

---

## Context Resolution Rules

Context resolution should:

* apply explicit defaults;
* resolve configuration;
* identify dependency state;
* identify toolchain state;
* validate required inputs;
* determine artifact expectations;
* detect unsupported combinations.

Implicit behavior should be minimized.

---

## Layer 4 — Build Environment

The Build Environment Layer provides the runtime conditions required for execution.

A build environment may be:

* local;
* CI-managed;
* containerized;
* virtual-environment based;
* isolated through future build infrastructure.

The architecture does not require a single mechanism.

It requires sufficient control.

---

## Environment Responsibilities

The Build Environment is responsible for providing:

* required runtime;
* required tools;
* dependency availability;
* filesystem access;
* execution permissions;
* controlled configuration channels.

The environment must not introduce undocumented build behavior.

---

## Environment Validation

Before execution, relevant environment assumptions should be validated.

Examples include:

```text
Python Version
Dependency Environment
Required Tools
Required Files
Supported Platform
Required Configuration
```

Invalid environments should fail early.

---

## Layer 5 — Build Orchestration

The Build Orchestration Layer coordinates the build lifecycle.

Its responsibility is to determine:

* which stages execute;
* in which order;
* under which profile;
* with which context;
* which stages are optional;
* what happens on failure.

Orchestration should remain explicit.

---

## Canonical Orchestration Flow

A representative flow is:

```text
Resolve Context
      ↓
Validate Inputs
      ↓
Validate Environment
      ↓
Prepare Build
      ↓
Execute Build
      ↓
Collect Artifacts
      ↓
Validate Artifacts
      ↓
Generate Evidence
      ↓
Finalize Build
```

Different build types may specialize this flow.

---

## Orchestration And Policy

Orchestration may evaluate policy requirements.

Examples include:

* required validation stages;
* release-candidate restrictions;
* plugin compliance checks;
* documentation generation requirements.

Policy evaluation should remain separated from low-level transformation logic where practical.

---

## Layer 6 — Build Execution

The Build Execution Layer performs concrete transformations.

Execution may include:

* package construction;
* source generation;
* resource generation;
* metadata generation;
* documentation generation;
* plugin packaging;
* manifest creation.

This layer performs work but does not alone establish trust.

---

## Execution Units

A build may consist of multiple execution units.

Conceptually:

```text
Build Execution
│
├── Prepare
├── Generate
├── Package
├── Assemble
└── Finalize
```

Each unit should have explicit inputs and outputs where practical.

---

## Execution Boundaries

Execution should not silently modify authoritative source state.

Where generated source or metadata is written into the repository, the behavior must be deliberate and documented.

Temporary execution state should remain isolated.

---

## Layer 7 — Artifact Layer

The Artifact Layer manages outputs produced by build execution.

Artifacts are explicit engineering objects.

The layer is responsible for:

* artifact discovery;
* classification;
* naming;
* identity;
* metadata;
* integrity information;
* output location.

---

## Artifact Model

A conceptual artifact is:

```text
Artifact
│
├── Identity
├── Type
├── Location
├── Build Association
├── Integrity Data
├── Metadata
└── Validation State
```

Artifacts may exist individually or as a related set.

---

## Artifact Set Model

A build may produce:

```text
Build
│
├── Primary Package
├── Source Distribution
├── Documentation
├── Manifest
├── Validation Report
└── Provenance Data
```

The Build Architecture must not assume one build produces only one file.

---

## Artifact Locations

Artifact destinations should be predictable.

Possible categories include:

* temporary outputs;
* intermediate outputs;
* final build outputs;
* validation reports;
* release handoff artifacts.

The architecture should prevent accidental confusion between these categories.

---

## Layer 8 — Validation Layer

The Validation Layer determines whether build state and artifacts satisfy applicable requirements.

Validation can occur at multiple points.

```text
Input Validation
      ↓
Environment Validation
      ↓
Execution Validation
      ↓
Artifact Validation
```

Validation is central to build trust.

---

## Input Validation

Input validation may verify:

* required files;
* package metadata;
* configuration;
* dependency declarations;
* source state;
* build profile.

---

## Environment Validation

Environment validation may verify:

* supported runtime;
* tool availability;
* dependency environment;
* platform compatibility;
* required variables.

---

## Execution Validation

Execution validation determines whether build stages completed correctly.

This may include:

* exit status;
* expected generated outputs;
* execution invariants;
* intermediate validation.

---

## Artifact Validation

Artifact validation may verify:

* expected artifact presence;
* naming;
* structure;
* metadata;
* integrity;
* installability;
* package format;
* compliance requirements.

---

## Layer 9 — Evidence Layer

The Evidence Layer captures information supporting build trust.

Evidence connects execution to artifact origin.

A conceptual evidence model is:

```text
Build Evidence
│
├── Build ID
├── Source Revision
├── Build Profile
├── Configuration
├── Dependency State
├── Toolchain State
├── Environment State
├── Validation Results
├── Artifact Manifest
└── Integrity Data
```

Evidence requirements may differ by profile.

---

## Evidence Profiles

For example:

```text
Development Build
      ↓
Minimal Evidence

CI Build
      ↓
Standard Evidence

Release Candidate
      ↓
Strong Evidence
```

The architecture supports proportional evidence requirements.

---

## Layer 10 — Integration Layer

The Integration Layer connects the Build Framework to the broader FamilyOS Engineering Platform.

Key integrations include:

* Engineering Foundation;
* Testing Framework;
* Quality Framework;
* Documentation Framework;
* Plugin Architecture;
* Plugin Compliance Framework;
* Security Architecture;
* Release Framework;
* CI infrastructure.

The Build Framework must cooperate with these systems without absorbing their responsibilities.

---

## Relationship With Testing Architecture

Testing may be invoked during build validation.

The relationship is:

```text
Build Orchestration
       ↓
Testing Capability
       ↓
Test Evidence
       ↓
Build Validation
```

Testing architecture remains owned by EPIC-TST-001.

---

## Relationship With Quality Architecture

The Build Framework may expose build-specific quality evidence.

For example:

```text
Build Metrics
Build Validation
Artifact Integrity
Build Reproducibility
```

These may participate in Quality Framework assessments.

---

## Relationship With Documentation Architecture

Documentation may be both:

* build input;
* generated artifact.

The architecture must support both relationships.

---

## Relationship With Plugin Architecture

Plugins may introduce specialized build inputs and outputs.

The core Build Architecture should support:

```text
Plugin Source
     ↓
Canonical Build Layers
     ↓
Plugin Artifact
```

without requiring each plugin to invent an independent build architecture.

---

## Relationship With Plugin Compliance

Plugin compliance checks may participate in validation.

For example:

```text
Plugin Build
    ↓
Compliance Validation
    ↓
Artifact Trust
```

The Build Framework consumes compliance results but does not redefine compliance policy.

---

## Relationship With Security Architecture

Security requirements may apply throughout the build layers.

```text
Inputs
  ↓
Dependencies
  ↓
Toolchain
  ↓
Environment
  ↓
Execution
  ↓
Artifacts
```

Each layer may introduce supply-chain risk.

Security must therefore be considered throughout the architecture.

---

## Relationship With Release Architecture

The Release Framework receives trusted build outputs.

The architectural handoff is:

```text
Build Framework
      │
      ├── Artifacts
      ├── Metadata
      ├── Integrity Data
      ├── Validation State
      └── Evidence
              ↓
       Release Framework
```

Release decisions remain outside Build Framework authority.

---

## Canonical Build Pipeline Architecture

The complete canonical pipeline can be represented as:

```text
Repository State
      ↓
Input Discovery
      ↓
Context Resolution
      ↓
Input Validation
      ↓
Environment Resolution
      ↓
Environment Validation
      ↓
Dependency Resolution
      ↓
Build Preparation
      ↓
Execution
      ↓
Artifact Collection
      ↓
Artifact Identification
      ↓
Artifact Validation
      ↓
Evidence Generation
      ↓
Build Finalization
      ↓
Trusted Artifacts
      ↓
Release Handoff
```

Not all builds must expose every stage separately.

The responsibilities must remain conceptually present.

---

## Build Profile Architecture

Build profiles specialize the canonical architecture.

Possible profiles include:

```text
development
validation
ci
documentation
plugin
release-candidate
```

A profile may control:

* required validations;
* artifact set;
* evidence level;
* environment restrictions;
* optimization behavior.

Profiles must not change foundational architecture.

---

## Development Profile

A development build prioritizes:

* speed;
* feedback;
* accessibility.

It may use lighter evidence requirements while preserving canonical semantics.

---

## Validation Profile

A validation build prioritizes:

* correctness;
* diagnostics;
* test integration;
* policy verification.

It may produce limited distributable artifacts.

---

## CI Profile

A CI build prioritizes:

* controlled execution;
* repeatability;
* standard evidence;
* automation compatibility.

---

## Release Candidate Profile

A release candidate build uses the strongest build controls required before release handoff.

It may require:

* clean repository state;
* locked dependency state;
* explicit toolchain;
* complete validation;
* artifact metadata;
* checksums;
* retained evidence.

---

## Plugin Profile

A plugin build may include:

* plugin metadata validation;
* capability validation;
* compliance checks;
* plugin artifact generation;
* plugin-specific manifests.

It still follows the canonical Build Architecture.

---

## Documentation Profile

A documentation build may produce:

* generated references;
* indexes;
* manifests;
* documentation bundles;
* validation reports.

Documentation artifacts may use the same artifact identity and traceability principles where appropriate.

---

## Dependency Architecture

Dependency resolution occupies a controlled position within the build.

```text
Dependency Declaration
       ↓
Version Constraints
       ↓
Resolution
       ↓
Resolved Dependency State
       ↓
Build Context
```

Dependency resolution must not remain invisible.

---

## Toolchain Architecture

The toolchain is similarly modeled.

```text
Tool Requirements
      ↓
Tool Resolution
      ↓
Toolchain Validation
      ↓
Execution
```

This allows toolchain drift to be detected.

---

## Configuration Architecture

Build configuration follows:

```text
Versioned Configuration
       ↓
Profile Selection
       ↓
Override Resolution
       ↓
Effective Configuration
       ↓
Validation
       ↓
Build Context
```

The effective configuration should be inspectable.

---

## Environment Architecture

Environment handling follows:

```text
Environment Requirements
          ↓
Environment Detection
          ↓
Environment Validation
          ↓
Execution Context
```

This reduces reliance on implicit workstation state.

---

## Artifact Architecture

Artifact production follows:

```text
Build Execution
      ↓
Raw Output
      ↓
Artifact Classification
      ↓
Artifact Identity
      ↓
Artifact Metadata
      ↓
Artifact Validation
      ↓
Trusted Artifact
```

This distinguishes generated output from trusted output.

---

## Evidence Architecture

Evidence production should be integrated with the lifecycle.

```text
Context
  ↓
Execution
  ↓
Validation
  ↓
Evidence Assembly
  ↓
Build Record
```

Evidence must not depend entirely on reconstructing logs afterward.

---

## Observability Architecture

Observability crosses all layers.

```text
Interface
   │
Inputs
   │
Environment
   │
Execution
   │
Artifacts
   │
Validation
```

Each stage should expose useful information appropriate to its responsibility.

---

## Error Architecture

Failures should propagate through defined boundaries.

```text
Failure
  ↓
Stage Identification
  ↓
Classification
  ↓
Diagnostic Context
  ↓
Build Result
```

Errors should not disappear inside automation layers.

---

## Build Result Model

A build result should conceptually expose:

```text
BuildResult
│
├── Build ID
├── Status
├── Profile
├── Artifacts
├── Validation State
├── Evidence
└── Diagnostics
```

The concrete representation may evolve.

---

## Build State Model

A build may progress through states such as:

```text
REQUESTED
   ↓
RESOLVING
   ↓
VALIDATING
   ↓
EXECUTING
   ↓
ARTIFACT_PROCESSING
   ↓
FINAL_VALIDATION
   ↓
COMPLETED
```

Failure may occur at any state.

Additional states may be introduced if needed.

---

## Trusted Artifact Boundary

An artifact becomes trusted only after applicable validation succeeds.

```text
Generated Output
      ↓
Artifact Identification
      ↓
Validation
      ↓
Evidence
      ↓
Trusted Artifact
```

This is one of the most important boundaries in the architecture.

---

## Release Handoff Contract

The Build Framework should expose a clear conceptual contract to the Release Framework.

A release handoff may include:

```text
ReleaseBuildHandoff
│
├── Build ID
├── Artifact Set
├── Artifact Metadata
├── Integrity Information
├── Validation Results
├── Evidence References
└── Build Profile
```

The Release Framework may reject the handoff if additional release requirements are not satisfied.

---

## Architectural Invariants

The following invariants should remain true across implementations.

### Invariant 1

Build inputs must be identifiable.

### Invariant 2

Build configuration must resolve before execution.

### Invariant 3

Unsupported environments must not silently continue.

### Invariant 4

Execution output is not automatically trusted.

### Invariant 5

Artifacts must pass applicable validation before trust.

### Invariant 6

Evidence must remain associated with the relevant build.

### Invariant 7

Release authority remains outside the Build Framework.

### Invariant 8

Automation must execute the canonical build model rather than redefine it.

---

## Architectural Anti-Patterns

The Build Architecture explicitly rejects several patterns.

---

### CI-As-Build-System

```text
CI YAML
  ↓
Everything
```

Critical build logic must not exist exclusively in CI configuration.

---

### Hidden Local Tooling

```text
Developer Machine
      ↓
Undocumented Tools
      ↓
Successful Build
```

This creates non-reproducible behavior.

---

### Artifact Without Origin

```text
artifact.whl
```

with no known relationship to source, build, or validation is insufficient for trusted release use.

---

### Multiple Build Definitions

Independent local, CI, and release build logic creates semantic drift.

---

### Validation After Release

Build validation must occur before release handoff, not after official distribution.

---

### Build Logic Scattered Across Repository

Build responsibilities should remain discoverable and intentionally structured.

---

## Architectural Extensibility

The Build Architecture must allow future capabilities without destabilizing core concepts.

Potential future extensions include:

* multiple languages;
* multiple package formats;
* remote builders;
* artifact registries;
* provenance systems;
* signing systems;
* policy engines;
* distributed caching;
* isolated build workers.

These capabilities should integrate through existing architectural responsibilities rather than bypass them.

---

## Technology Independence

The architecture intentionally avoids requiring a specific technology.

Current FamilyOS implementations may use tools such as:

* Python;
* `pyproject.toml`;
* packaging backends;
* Ruff;
* MyPy;
* Pytest;
* Git;
* CI workflows.

These technologies implement the architecture.

They do not define it.

---

## Simplicity Constraint

The Build Architecture must remain no more complex than necessary.

New architectural components should be introduced only when they solve demonstrated problems.

The default progression is:

```text
Simple Architecture
      ↓
Observed Limitation
      ↓
Architectural Evaluation
      ↓
Controlled Extension
```

---

## Architectural Governance

Significant changes to the Build Architecture may require formal governance.

Examples include:

* changing build layer boundaries;
* introducing new artifact trust models;
* changing release handoff contracts;
* introducing remote build infrastructure;
* changing dependency resolution architecture;
* introducing artifact signing;
* modifying canonical build semantics.

The applicable governance mechanism may include an ADR, RFC, or EPIC revision.

---

## Architectural Quality Attributes

The Build Architecture should optimize for the following qualities:

* correctness;
* reproducibility;
* transparency;
* traceability;
* maintainability;
* portability;
* diagnosability;
* security;
* automation compatibility;
* scalability.

Performance is important but remains subordinate to trust.

---

## Reference Architecture

The canonical reference architecture is:

```text
                     ┌──────────────────────┐
                     │   Build Interface    │
                     └──────────┬───────────┘
                                │
                     ┌──────────▼───────────┐
                     │ Context Resolution   │
                     └──────────┬───────────┘

          ┌─────────────────────▼─────────────────────┐
          │              Build Context               │
          │ Source │ Config │ Deps │ Tools │ Policy │
          └─────────────────────┬─────────────────────┘
                                │
                     ┌──────────▼───────────┐
                     │ Environment Control  │
                     └──────────┬───────────┘
                                │
                     ┌──────────▼───────────┐
                     │ Build Orchestration  │
                     └──────────┬───────────┘
                                │
                     ┌──────────▼───────────┐
                     │  Build Execution     │
                     └──────────┬───────────┘
                                │
                     ┌──────────▼───────────┐
                     │ Artifact Processing  │
                     └──────────┬───────────┘
                                │
                     ┌──────────▼───────────┐
                     │ Build Validation     │
                     └──────────┬───────────┘
                                │
                     ┌──────────▼───────────┐
                     │ Evidence Generation  │
                     └──────────┬───────────┘
                                │
                     ┌──────────▼───────────┐
                     │  Trusted Artifacts   │
                     └──────────┬───────────┘
                                │
                     ┌──────────▼───────────┐
                     │ Release Framework    │
                     └──────────────────────┘
```

This reference model defines the structural foundation for later implementation.

## Architecture Success Criteria

The Build Architecture is successful when FamilyOS can clearly identify:

1. what enters the build;
2. how context is resolved;
3. which environment is required;
4. how execution is orchestrated;
5. where transformations occur;
6. how artifacts are represented;
7. where validation occurs;
8. how evidence is generated;
9. how failures propagate;

## Final Architectural Principle

The FamilyOS Build Architecture is founded on the following rule:

> Every significant transformation between source state and trusted artifact must have an explicit architectural responsibility.

Build behavior must therefore remain understandable as a system.

Inputs must be distinguishable from environment.

Environment must be distinguishable from execution.

Execution must be distinguishable from artifacts.

Artifacts must be distinguishable from validation.

Validation must be distinguishable from release authority.

This separation provides the architectural foundation required for reproducible, traceable, maintainable, and trustworthy FamilyOS builds.
