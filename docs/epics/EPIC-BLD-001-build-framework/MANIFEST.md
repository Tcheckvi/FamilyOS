## 1. Purpose

This manifest defines the authoritative canonical document inventory for:

**EPIC-BLD-001 — Build Framework**

The Build Framework establishes the FamilyOS engineering foundation for transforming controlled engineering state into validated, traceable, reproducible, and trustworthy software artifacts.

This manifest defines:

* the canonical numbered document sequence;
* the canonical control document set;
* the complete canonical file inventory;
* structural integrity requirements;
* document ownership boundaries;
* inventory validation requirements;
* synchronization requirements;
* historical publication context.

The physical repository inventory and `EPIC.yaml` SHALL remain consistent with this manifest.

---

## 2. Canonical Directory

The canonical framework directory is:

```text
docs/epics/EPIC-BLD-001-build-framework/
```

All canonical Build Framework documents defined by this manifest SHALL exist directly within this directory.

---

## 3. Canonical Structure

EPIC-BLD-001 contains two document classes:

```text
Numbered Framework Documents
        +
Control Documents
```

The numbered framework documentation consists of exactly:

```text
00 → 23
```

representing:

```text
24 numbered documents
```

The EPIC additionally contains:

```text
7 control documents
```

Therefore, the complete canonical inventory is:

```text
24 numbered documents
+
7 control documents
=
31 canonical files
```

---

## 4. Numbered Document Inventory

---

## 5. Control Document Inventory

The Build Framework contains exactly seven canonical control documents.

| Document              | Purpose                                                                                                                                             |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `EPIC-BLD-001.md`     | Provides the concise EPIC-level definition, scope, objectives, dependencies, completion state, and success criteria.                                |
| `EPIC.yaml`           | Provides the machine-readable EPIC contract, canonical inventory, dependencies, quality gates, baseline state, and historical publication metadata. |
| `README.md`           | Provides the human-readable entry point and navigation guide for the Build Framework.                                                               |
| `MANIFEST.md`         | Defines the authoritative canonical inventory and structural contract for EPIC-BLD-001.                                                             |
| `CHANGELOG.md`        | Records significant Build Framework changes and historical evolution.                                                                               |

| `Revision-History.md` | Preserves the historical revision and publication record of the Build Framework.                                                                    |

These documents are canonical framework artifacts.

They are not optional metadata.

## 6. Complete Canonical Inventory

The complete canonical inventory is:

```text
00-EPIC.md
01-Context.md
02-Vision.md
03-Build-Principles.md
04-Build-Architecture.md
05-Build-Lifecycle.md
06-Build-Input-Requirements.md
07-Build-Inputs-and-Project-Structure.md
08-Build-Toolchain.md
09-Build-Environment-Management.md
10-Dependency-Management.md
11-Build-Configuration.md
12-Build-Philosophy.md
13-Build-Execution.md
14-Artifact-Management.md
15-Build-Validation.md
16-Build-Governance.md
17-Build-Automation-and-CI.md
18-Roadmap.md
19-References.md
20-Validation.md
21-Summary.md
22-Release.md
23-Implementation-Checklist.md
EPIC-BLD-001.md
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

Canonical inventory:

```text
Numbered Documents: 24
Control Documents:   7
Canonical Files:     31
Canonical Range:     00 → 23
```

---

## 7. Structural Requirements

The canonical Build Framework SHALL satisfy all of the following:

```text
Exactly 24 numbered documents
Sequential numbering from 00 through 23
Exactly one canonical document for each number
Exactly 7 control documents
Exactly 31 canonical files
No duplicate document numbers
No missing canonical numbers
No empty required canonical documents
No unresolved legacy migration files
No unresolved temporary framework files
Canonical filenames match their responsibilities
EPIC.yaml matches the physical repository inventory
MANIFEST.md matches the physical repository inventory
Control documents describe the same framework state
```

Any violation SHALL be treated as a structural integrity finding until resolved or explicitly governed.

---

## 8. Numbering Integrity

The numbered sequence SHALL be continuous:

```text
00
01
02
03
04
05
06
07
08
09
10
11
12
13
14
15
16
17
18
19
20
21
22
23
```

There SHALL be:

```text
24 / 24 numbered documents present
0 missing numbers
0 duplicate numbers
```

Additional numbered documents SHALL NOT be introduced without a governed framework structure change.

---

## 9. Control Document Integrity

The required control documents are:

```text
EPIC-BLD-001.md
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

Expected result:

```text
7 / 7 control documents present
```

A missing control document invalidates the canonical inventory.

---

## 10. File Completeness

Every canonical file SHALL:

* exist;
* be readable;
* be non-empty;
* contain substantive content appropriate to its responsibility;
* use its canonical filename;
* remain part of the governed framework inventory.

Placeholder-only files do not satisfy canonical completeness.

---

## 11. Canonical Ownership

The Build Framework owns detailed engineering guidance for:

* Build Principles;
* Build Architecture;
* Build Lifecycle;
* build inputs;
* build input requirements;
* build project structure;
* Build Toolchain;
* Build Environment Management;
* dependency management as it affects builds;
* Build Configuration;
* Build Philosophy;
* Build Execution;
* Artifact Management;
* Build Validation;
* Build Governance;
* Build Automation;
* CI build integration;
* build evidence;
* artifact trust;
* build reproducibility;
* build traceability;
* release handoff from the build domain.

These responsibilities SHALL remain coherent across the numbered and control documents.

---

## 12. Framework Boundaries

EPIC-BLD-001 operates within the broader FamilyOS engineering architecture.

The Build Framework depends on foundational engineering capabilities including:

* `EPIC-ENG-001` — Engineering Foundation;
* `EPIC-DOC-001` — Documentation Foundation;
* `EPIC-TST-001` — Testing Framework;
* `EPIC-QLT-001` — Quality Framework.

It integrates with specialized frameworks including:

* `EPIC-REL-001` — Release Framework;
* `EPIC-OBS-001` — Observability Framework;
* `EPIC-SEC-001` — Security Framework;
* `EPIC-OPS-001` — Operations Framework.

The Build Framework SHALL NOT silently absorb responsibilities owned by those specialized frameworks.

---

## 13. Build and Release Boundary

The Build Framework owns the transformation of controlled engineering state into validated build artifacts and associated evidence.

The Release Framework owns release planning, release candidates, release approval, publication, distribution, rollback, and release lifecycle governance.

The Build Framework may provide a release handoff containing:

```text
Trusted Artifact Set
Build ID
Artifact Manifest
Artifact Digests
Validation Result
Build Evidence
Provenance Information
```

The Build Framework SHALL NOT treat artifact generation alone as release publication.

---

## 14. Build Trust Model

The canonical Build Framework distinguishes between:

```text
Successful Execution
        ↓
Generated Output
        ↓
Validated Artifact
        ↓
Trusted Artifact
```

A successful build command does not by itself establish artifact trust.

Artifact trust requires controlled production conditions, validation, traceability, and sufficient evidence to understand the artifact's origin.

---

## 15. Build Evidence

Build Evidence may include:

* source revision identity;
* Build ID;
* build configuration;
* toolchain identity;
* environment identity;
* dependency state;
* execution metadata;
* validation results;
* artifact identity;
* artifact digests;
* provenance information;
* timestamps;
* relevant quality evidence.

Evidence requirements SHALL remain aligned with Build Validation and release handoff responsibilities.

---

## 16. Repository Inventory Contract

The physical repository SHALL match this manifest.

The expected top-level inventory is:

```text
31 files
```

with:

```text
24 numbered documents
7 control documents
```

Validation SHALL compare the declared inventory against the physical filesystem.

Expected result:

```text
Declared Files:   31
Filesystem Files: 31
Missing Files:    0
Unexpected Files: 0
```

---

## 17. EPIC.yaml Synchronization

`EPIC.yaml` SHALL declare the same canonical structure:

```yaml
structure:
  numbered_documents: 24
  canonical_document_range: "00-23"
  control_documents: 7
  canonical_files: 31
```

Its deliverable inventory SHALL contain exactly the 31 files defined by this manifest.

The following relationship SHALL hold:

```text
EPIC.yaml deliverables
        =
MANIFEST.md inventory
        =
physical repository inventory
```

---

## 18. Validation Authority

This manifest defines structure.

It does not independently prove that engineering quality gates have passed.

Actual validation evidence belongs in:

```text
VALIDATION.md
```

Normative validation requirements belong primarily in:

```text
20-Validation.md
```

Release requirements belong primarily in:

```text
22-Release.md
```

Only evidence from actual execution SHALL be used to convert pending engineering checks into PASS results.

---

## 19. Revalidation State

The Build Framework has a historical published baseline.

Historical publication:

```text
Framework Version: 1.0.0
Historical Tag:     v4.7.0-build-framework
Publication State:  Published
```

The historical publication tag SHALL remain immutable.

The current documentation normalization is a post-release correction and revalidation activity.

Until actual revalidation evidence is recorded in `VALIDATION.md`, the machine-readable baseline may remain:

```yaml
repository_validation_status: pending_revalidation
final_validation_status: pending_revalidation
```

The historical publication itself is not invalidated by this revalidation process.

---

## 20. Historical Tag Immutability

The historical publication tag is:

```text
v4.7.0-build-framework
```

This tag identifies the original published Build Framework baseline.

Post-release documentation normalization SHALL NOT move, recreate, overwrite, or reinterpret this historical tag.

Corrections after historical publication SHALL be represented by subsequent commits.

---

## 21. Legacy File Policy

Legacy, temporary, migration, backup, or duplicate framework files SHALL NOT remain in the canonical baseline unless explicitly governed.

Examples include:

```text
*.bak
*.tmp
*.orig
*.old
*~
migration scripts
temporary generated files
duplicate numbered documents
obsolete canonical replacements
```

The canonical inventory SHALL remain explicit and inspectable.

---

## 22. Duplicate Responsibility Policy

Documents that duplicate canonical responsibilities SHOULD NOT coexist indefinitely.

Where historical restructuring produces overlapping documents:

1. identify the canonical owner;
2. migrate required information;
3. preserve historical context where necessary;
4. remove the obsolete active duplicate;
5. update references;
6. validate the resulting inventory.

One framework responsibility SHOULD have one clear canonical documentation owner.

---

## 23. Naming Requirements

Canonical filenames SHALL remain stable unless a governed structure change explicitly requires renaming.

Renaming a canonical document requires coordinated updates to:

* `EPIC.yaml`;
* `MANIFEST.md`;
* `README.md`;
* local Markdown references;
* validation rules;
* revision history;
* any affected governance documentation.

Uncoordinated renaming SHALL be treated as an integrity defect.

---

## 24. Reference Integrity

Local references between Build Framework documents SHALL resolve to existing canonical files.

Validation SHOULD detect:

* references to missing files;
* obsolete canonical filenames;
* broken local Markdown links;
* references to removed migration files;
* ambiguous document ownership.

Reference integrity SHALL be recorded in `VALIDATION.md`.

---

## 25. Semantic Integrity

Structural completeness alone is insufficient.

The canonical corpus SHALL remain semantically coherent regarding:

* Build Architecture;
* Build Lifecycle;
* build input terminology;
* environment terminology;
* dependency semantics;
* configuration semantics;
* Build Execution;
* artifact terminology;
* artifact trust;
* Build Validation;
* Build Governance;
* automation responsibilities;
* release handoff;
* framework boundaries.

Semantic contradictions SHALL be resolved before final revalidation is declared complete.

---

## 26. Governance Integrity

Governance responsibilities SHALL remain aligned across:

```text
16-Build-Governance.md
20-Validation.md
22-Release.md
23-Implementation-Checklist.md
EPIC-BLD-001.md
EPIC.yaml
MANIFEST.md
VALIDATION.md
```

A control document SHALL NOT silently redefine authority established by the normative framework.

---

## 27. Change Control

Any modification to the canonical inventory SHALL evaluate:

* whether numbering changes;
* whether a canonical responsibility changes;
* whether `EPIC.yaml` requires modification;
* whether `MANIFEST.md` requires modification;
* whether README navigation changes;
* whether references require migration;
* whether validation evidence must be regenerated;
* whether the framework version should change;
* whether downstream frameworks are affected.

Structural changes SHALL be explicit and reviewable.

---

## 28. Validation Procedure

The canonical inventory SHOULD be validated programmatically.

Example conceptual validation:

```text
Load EPIC.yaml
        ↓
Read declared deliverables
        ↓
Enumerate physical files
        ↓
Compare inventories
        ↓
Validate numbered sequence
        ↓
Validate control documents
        ↓
Validate non-empty files
        ↓
Validate references
        ↓
Record evidence in VALIDATION.md
```

Expected structural outcome:

```text
YAML Parse:            PASS
Declared Deliverables: 31
Filesystem Files:      31
Numbered Documents:    24
Control Documents:     7
Missing Files:         0
Unexpected Files:      0
Empty Required Files:  0
```

---

## 29. Canonical Validation Commands

Repository validation may include commands such as:

```text
ruff check .
mypy src
pytest -q
git diff --check
```

These commands are evidence-producing operations.

Their results SHALL NOT be marked PASS in this manifest merely because they are required.

Actual execution results belong in `VALIDATION.md`.

---

## 30. Structural Acceptance Criteria

The manifest contract is satisfied when:

* [x] the canonical numbered range is defined as `00 → 23`;
* [x] exactly 24 numbered documents are declared;
* [x] exactly 7 control documents are declared;
* [x] exactly 31 canonical files are declared;
* [x] every canonical filename is explicitly listed;
* [x] framework ownership is defined;
* [x] Build and Release responsibilities are separated;
* [x] historical publication context is identified;
* [x] historical tag immutability is defined;
* [x] validation authority is separated from inventory authority.

Repository-level confirmation of these conditions SHALL be recorded in `VALIDATION.md`.

---

## 31. Canonical Manifest Summary

```text
EPIC:                 EPIC-BLD-001
Framework:            Build Framework
Framework Version:    1.0.0
Status:               Completed

Numbered Documents:   24
Canonical Range:      00 → 23
Control Documents:    7
Canonical Files:      31

Historical Tag:       v4.7.0-build-framework
Publication Status:   Published
Historical Tag:       Immutable

```

---

## 32. Final Manifest Principle

The Build Framework cannot be governed reliably if its canonical structure is ambiguous.

Therefore:

> One Build Framework must have one explicit canonical inventory, one authoritative structural contract, clearly separated validation evidence, and an immutable historical publication record.
