# Build Framework

## 16 Build Governance

### Overview

EPIC-BLD-001 — Build Framework defines the governance model used to control the evolution, ownership, compliance, review, and maintenance of FamilyOS build engineering.

Build governance exists to prevent the build system from evolving through isolated scripts, undocumented conventions, CI-only behavior, accidental toolchain drift, or unreviewed artifact changes.

The objective is not to create unnecessary bureaucracy.

The objective is to ensure that significant build decisions remain explicit, reviewable, traceable, and aligned with the broader FamilyOS Engineering Platform.

The central principle is:

> Build behavior may evolve, but build architecture must never drift accidentally.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of Build Governance is to define how FamilyOS manages:

* build ownership;
* architectural authority;
* build standards;
* toolchain decisions;
* dependency governance;
* configuration governance;
* artifact governance;
* validation governance;
* automation governance;
* exceptions;
* technical debt;
* risk;
* change review;
* lifecycle evolution;
* framework compliance.

Governance provides the decision structure that keeps build engineering coherent over time.

---

## Governance Objectives

Build Governance aims to ensure that:

* build architecture remains consistent;
* build responsibilities remain clear;
* significant changes are reviewed;
* build standards remain enforceable;
* build decisions are documented;
* framework boundaries remain respected;
* toolchain changes remain controlled;
* artifact contracts remain stable;
* validation is not weakened accidentally;
* CI does not become an uncontrolled source of build semantics;
* exceptions remain explicit;
* build debt is visible and manageable.

---

## Governance Model

The canonical governance model is:

```text
Engineering Need
      ↓
Impact Assessment
      ↓
Decision Classification
      ↓
Appropriate Review
      ↓
Implementation
      ↓
Validation
      ↓
Documentation
      ↓
Adoption
      ↓
Ongoing Review
```

Not every change requires the same level of governance.

---

## Governance Principle 1 — Governance Must Be Proportional

Routine build maintenance should remain lightweight.

Architecturally significant changes require stronger review.

The model is:

```text
Low Impact
   ↓
Normal Review

Medium Impact
   ↓
Technical Review

High Impact
   ↓
Architecture Governance
```

This keeps governance effective without slowing ordinary engineering unnecessarily.

---

## Governance Principle 2 — Ownership Must Be Clear

Every major build capability should have identifiable ownership.

Ownership may include:

* architecture ownership;
* tooling ownership;
* dependency ownership;
* configuration ownership;
* artifact ownership;
* validation ownership;
* automation ownership.

Unowned build behavior tends to become unmanaged technical debt.

---

## Governance Principle 3 — Architecture Decisions Must Be Explicit

Significant build architecture changes must not emerge through incremental implementation alone.

Changes affecting:

* build boundaries;
* lifecycle;
* artifact contracts;
* dependency architecture;
* toolchain architecture;
* evidence model;
* release handoff;

require explicit architectural consideration.

---

## Governance Principle 4 — Framework Boundaries Must Be Preserved

Build Governance must respect ownership boundaries with:

* Engineering Foundation;
* Testing Framework;
* Quality Framework;
* Documentation Framework;
* Plugin Compliance Framework;
* Security Architecture;
* Release Framework.

The Build Framework may integrate with these systems.

It must not silently absorb their governance responsibilities.

---

## Governance Principle 5 — Canonical Behavior Must Have One Authority

FamilyOS should avoid conflicting build rules defined independently across:

* source code;
* CI;
* scripts;
* documentation;
* release workflows.

Each build concern should have a clear canonical authority.

---

## Governance Principle 6 — Exceptions Must Be Explicit

Temporary deviations may sometimes be necessary.

An exception must not become invisible permanent behavior.

A governed exception should identify:

* reason;
* scope;
* owner;
* risk;
* affected requirement;
* review or expiration expectation.

---

## Governance Principle 7 — Build Debt Must Be Visible

Technical debt in build systems must be treated as real engineering debt.

Examples include:

* duplicate scripts;
* obsolete build paths;
* hidden CI logic;
* stale configuration;
* unsupported tools;
* undocumented manual steps;
* permanently skipped validation.

Debt should be tracked and deliberately reduced.

---

## Governance Principle 8 — Significant Changes Require Evidence

Major build changes should be validated through evidence appropriate to their risk.

Examples include:

* test results;
* build results;
* artifact comparisons;
* reproducibility checks;
* migration validation;
* compatibility results.

Change approval should not rely only on intention.

---

## Governance Scope

Build Governance applies to:

```text
Build Governance
│
├── Architecture
├── Toolchain
├── Dependencies
├── Configuration
├── Environment
├── Execution
├── Artifacts
├── Validation
├── Automation
├── Evidence
└── Framework Evolution
```

---

## Build Ownership

Build ownership should be divided by responsibility rather than concentrated in one person.

Conceptually:

```text
Build Architecture
      → Platform Engineering

Build Implementation
      → Engineering Maintainers

Toolchain
      → Engineering / Build Maintainers

Artifacts
      → Build + Release Owners

Validation
      → Build + Testing + Quality

Security Controls
      → Security Governance
```

Exact organizational ownership may evolve.

---

## Build Architecture Ownership

Build architecture ownership includes responsibility for:

* canonical build model;
* architectural boundaries;
* execution stages;
* artifact trust model;
* release handoff design.

Architectural ownership should remain stable even if implementation ownership changes.

---

## Build Maintenance Ownership

Maintenance ownership includes:

* script upkeep;
* tool updates;
* configuration updates;
* CI integration;
* documentation synchronization.

---

## Component Ownership

Individual FamilyOS components may own their component-specific build definitions.

However, component build behavior must comply with platform Build Framework rules.

---

## Plugin Ownership

Plugin teams may own plugin-specific build content.

They must not redefine:

* artifact trust;
* dependency governance;
* release handoff;
* compliance requirements;

outside platform governance.

---

## Decision Classification

Build changes should be classified according to impact.

A conceptual classification is:

```text
Class 1 — Routine
Class 2 — Significant
Class 3 — Architectural
Class 4 — Strategic
```

---

## Class 1 — Routine Changes

Examples include:

* diagnostic improvements;
* internal refactoring;
* harmless script cleanup;
* documentation corrections;
* patch-level tool updates with no semantic impact.

These generally require normal engineering review.

---

## Class 2 — Significant Changes

Examples include:

* new build profile;
* changed validation stage;
* changed artifact output;
* new mandatory build tool;
* new dependency resolution behavior.

These require explicit technical review.

---

## Class 3 — Architectural Changes

Examples include:

* new build execution architecture;
* changed artifact identity model;
* changed release handoff;
* new dependency architecture;
* new build environment model.

These may require an ADR.

---

## Class 4 — Strategic Changes

Examples include:

* new build platform;
* remote build execution;
* artifact signing architecture;
* provenance architecture;
* new supply-chain policy;
* cross-repository build system.

These may require RFC and EPIC evolution.

---

## Current Operational Governance Contract

The following contract makes the Build Governance model operational for the
current EPIC-BLD-001 implementation.

### Operational Ownership

Build Framework architecture is governed through EPIC-BLD-001 and its
authoritative architecture and governance documents.

Implementation and maintenance of canonical Build behavior belong to
Engineering Maintainers operating within those framework contracts.

Critical Build toolchain decisions belong to Engineering / Build Maintainers.
Tool introduction, upgrade, deprecation, or removal must preserve the canonical
toolchain and dependency-governance contracts.

CI owns provider-specific automation and invocation only. CI must invoke
canonical Build behavior and must not independently define Build semantics.

Build owns artifact construction, identity, integrity, metadata, validation,
and Build Evidence semantics. Release owns downstream promotion and release
policy. Changes crossing that boundary require review by both owning
frameworks.

### Operational Change Review

Routine changes are Class 1 changes. They follow normal code or documentation
review together with the validation appropriate to the affected surface.

Significant changes are Class 2 changes. They require explicit technical review
before adoption and must document their impact on affected Build contracts.

Class 3 changes establish or modify significant Build architecture and require
an ADR. This includes changes to canonical execution architecture, artifact
identity, release handoff architecture, dependency architecture, or the Build
environment model.

Class 4 changes affect broader platform strategy or multiple architectural
areas and require an RFC. EPIC evolution is also required when the change
modifies Build Framework responsibilities, structure, or long-term
requirements.

A change that is both Class 3 and Class 4 follows the stronger Class 4 path.
An RFC may incorporate or supersede the need for a separate ADR when the
architectural decision is fully captured by the RFC and repository governance
makes that relationship explicit.

### Operational Exception Process

An exception to a normative Build requirement must be explicit and recorded.
The exception record must identify:

* the requirement being excepted;
* the reason for the exception;
* the affected scope;
* the owning or approving authority;
* the risk or consequence accepted;
* compensating validation or controls, when applicable;
* whether the exception is temporary or intentionally persistent;
* the remediation, review, or expiry condition when applicable.

An exception must not silently redefine the canonical standard. Repeated or
structural exceptions must be evaluated as technical debt or as a proposal to
change the governing architecture.

### Operational Technical-Debt Tracking

Known Build debt must remain visible in an appropriate repository-owned
tracking surface such as the EPIC checklist, revision history, issue tracking,
or an explicitly referenced follow-up record.

Debt records should identify the affected Build concern, impact or risk, and
the expected remediation or review path. High-risk debt receives priority over
cosmetic cleanup.

### Operational Security Escalation

Changes involving credentials, new trust boundaries, dependency sources,
network authority, signing, privileged execution, or comparable
security-sensitive Build behavior require Security Architecture review.

Build Governance coordinates integration of the resulting requirements but
does not replace Security Architecture as the security-policy authority.

### Operational Artifact-Contract Review

Changes to artifact contents, identity, metadata, integrity semantics, naming,
or release handoff must receive compatibility review against known downstream
consumers.

Breaking artifact-contract changes must include rationale, migration impact,
documentation, and appropriate version or release handling.

### Operational Validation-Weakening Review

Removal, bypass, disabling, or weakening of mandatory Build validation requires
explicit technical justification and review before adoption.

A change must not weaken mandatory validation solely to make local or CI
execution pass. Security-sensitive or cross-framework weakening must also be
reviewed by the corresponding owning framework.

### Operational Governance Traceability

The required governance path is:

```text
Proposed Change
      ↓
Assess Scope And Risk
      ↓
Classify Change
      ↓
Select Required Review
      ↓
Record ADR / RFC / Exception / Debt When Required
      ↓
Implement
      ↓
Validate
      ↓
Synchronize Documentation
      ↓
Adopt
```

Significant framework changes update Revision-History.md. Release-relevant
changes update CHANGELOG.md. Changes to normative document inventory or
status update MANIFEST.md. Framework lifecycle state remains synchronized
with EPIC.yaml and related control documents.

Governance evidence remains repository-visible and may include ADRs, RFCs,
review records, exception records, validation reports, and change history.

## Governance Decision Flow

The decision flow is:

```text
Proposed Change
      ↓
Assess Scope
      ↓
Assess Risk
      ↓
Classify Change
      ↓
Select Governance Mechanism
```

---

## Governance Mechanisms

FamilyOS may use:

* normal code review;
* documentation review;
* technical review;
* ADR;
* RFC;
* EPIC revision;
* quality review;
* security review.

The mechanism should fit the change.

---

## ADR Relationship

Architecture Decision Records are appropriate when a change establishes or modifies a significant build architecture decision.

Examples include:

* changing build backend;
* adopting containerized builds;
* introducing artifact manifests;
* introducing canonical build identity.

---

## RFC Relationship

RFCs are appropriate when changes affect multiple platform areas or require broader architectural agreement.

Examples include:

* new artifact distribution architecture;
* cross-platform build strategy;
* supply-chain attestation model;
* remote execution architecture.

---

## EPIC Relationship

EPIC-BLD-001 should evolve when framework-level responsibilities, structure, or long-term requirements change.

Implementation changes that do not affect the framework do not require EPIC revision.

---

## Governance And Documentation

Significant build decisions must be reflected in documentation.

Documentation may include:

* architecture chapters;
* ADRs;
* RFCs;
* manifests;
* revision history;
* changelog;
* validation records.

Governance without documentation is incomplete.

---

## Governance And Traceability

A significant build decision should be traceable from:

```text
Requirement
   ↓
Decision
   ↓
Implementation
   ↓
Validation
   ↓
Documentation
```

This traceability supports future maintenance.

---

## Build Standards Governance

Build standards define the expected behavior of FamilyOS build capabilities.

Standards may govern:

* inputs;
* environments;
* dependencies;
* tooling;
* artifacts;
* validation;
* automation.

Standards must remain consistent across components.

---

## Standard Evolution

Build standards may evolve.

A standard change should consider:

* backward compatibility;
* migration cost;
* implementation readiness;
* documentation;
* automation;
* downstream release impact.

---

## Standard Exceptions

Exceptions should be rare and deliberate.

An exception should never silently redefine the standard.

---

## Toolchain Governance

Toolchain governance controls:

* tool introduction;
* version strategy;
* upgrade;
* deprecation;
* removal.

---

## Tool Introduction Governance

Before adopting a significant new tool, FamilyOS should assess:

* architectural need;
* overlap with existing tooling;
* security;
* maintainability;
* compatibility;
* migration cost.

---

## Tool Upgrade Governance

Tool upgrades should be validated according to impact.

High-impact tools include:

* runtime;
* build backend;
* dependency manager;
* artifact validator.

---

## Tool Removal Governance

Obsolete tools should be retired deliberately.

Removal should confirm:

* no canonical workflow depends on them;
* CI is updated;
* documentation is updated;
* configuration is removed.

---

## Dependency Governance

Dependency governance controls how dependencies are introduced, updated, replaced, and removed.

A dependency change should consider:

* necessity;
* maintenance;
* security;
* compatibility;
* reproducibility;
* licensing where applicable.

---

## Dependency Exception

An otherwise prohibited dependency may require an explicit exception if no suitable alternative exists.

The exception should be documented and reviewed.

---

## Configuration Governance

Configuration governance controls:

* canonical sources;
* precedence;
* profile semantics;
* overrides;
* deprecation.

Configuration changes that weaken validation or alter artifacts require stronger review.

---

## Profile Governance

Build profiles are part of the framework contract.

New profiles should only be introduced when they represent a genuinely distinct build purpose.

---

## Environment Governance

Environment governance controls:

* supported runtimes;
* supported platforms;
* isolation strategy;
* provisioning model;
* CI environment.

---

## Runtime Governance

Changing the canonical runtime may affect the complete engineering ecosystem.

Such changes require coordinated validation.

---

## Platform Governance

Adding or dropping a supported platform may affect:

* dependencies;
* artifacts;
* tests;
* release behavior.

Platform support must be explicit.

---

## Execution Governance

Execution governance controls:

* canonical entry points;
* stages;
* error semantics;
* retries;
* concurrency;
* side effects.

---

## Entry Point Governance

Canonical build commands should remain stable.

Breaking changes require migration documentation.

---

## Stage Governance

Adding or removing a mandatory build stage changes lifecycle semantics and requires review.

---

## Retry Governance

Retry behavior must not weaken failure transparency.

Automatically retrying deterministic errors should not become canonical behavior.

---

## Artifact Governance

Artifact governance controls:

* artifact classes;
* identity;
* naming;
* metadata;
* integrity;
* storage;
* handoff.

---

## New Artifact Type

Introducing a new official artifact type should define:

* purpose;
* producer;
* validation;
* metadata;
* consumers;
* release behavior.

---

## Artifact Contract Change

Changing artifact contents or metadata may affect downstream consumers and requires compatibility review.

---

## Integrity Governance

Standard integrity algorithms should be chosen deliberately.

Changes may affect stored evidence and release processes.

---

## Validation Governance

Validation governance determines:

* mandatory checks;
* optional checks;
* profile-specific requirements;
* blocking semantics.

---

## Validation Weakening

Removing or weakening mandatory validation requires explicit justification.

The default assumption is that trust controls should not be reduced casually.

---

## Validation Addition

New validation should be evaluated for:

* value;
* performance cost;
* reliability;
* false-positive risk;
* developer experience.

---

## Quality Gate Relationship

Quality gates remain governed by the Quality Framework.

Build Governance ensures that build-specific evidence is available for those gates.

---

## Security Governance

Security-sensitive build changes may require dedicated review.

Examples include:

* secret handling;
* dependency sources;
* network access;
* artifact signing;
* privileged build execution.

---

## Security Escalation

A change that introduces new trust boundaries or credentials should receive Security Architecture review.

---

## Automation Governance

Automation governance controls how CI and other automation invoke canonical build behavior.

---

## CI Governance

CI workflows should not become independent build authorities.

CI changes that alter semantics must update canonical build definitions first.

---

## CI Provider Changes

Changing CI provider should not require redesigning Build Framework semantics.

Provider-specific logic belongs at the integration layer.

---

## Automation Permissions

CI permissions should remain minimal.

Build jobs should not receive release or deployment permissions unless explicitly required.

---

## Evidence Governance

Build evidence should remain consistent and meaningful.

Evidence requirements may increase as platform maturity grows.

---

## Evidence Retention Governance

Retention requirements depend on:

* profile;
* artifact risk;
* release use;
* debugging value.

The Build Framework defines evidence semantics.

Storage duration may belong to operational policy.

---

## Provenance Governance

Formal provenance may eventually require:

* schema;
* identity;
* integrity;
* attestation authority.

This would likely require architecture-level governance.

---

## Build Exception Model

A build exception represents a controlled deviation from a framework rule.

A conceptual exception may include:

```text
BuildException
│
├── Identifier
├── Requirement
├── Scope
├── Reason
├── Risk
├── Owner
├── Approval
└── Review Date
```

A formal implementation may come later.

---

## Exception Rules

Exceptions SHOULD:

* be narrow;
* be documented;
* be time-bounded where practical;
* be reviewable;
* not silently propagate to unrelated components.

---

## Permanent Exceptions

A permanent exception may indicate that the framework rule itself should be revisited.

Governance should prefer updating the standard over accumulating permanent exceptions.

---

## Technical Debt Governance

Build technical debt should be identifiable.

Examples include:

```text
Legacy Script
CI-Only Logic
Duplicate Configuration
Unsupported Tool
Manual Build Step
Skipped Validation
```

---

## Debt Classification

Build debt may be classified by:

* impact;
* risk;
* maintenance cost;
* probability of failure.

---

## Debt Remediation

Debt remediation should follow priority rather than arbitrary cleanup.

High-risk debt should be addressed first.

---

## Build Risk Governance

Build risk may originate from:

* dependencies;
* toolchain;
* environment;
* artifacts;
* automation;
* security;
* governance gaps.

Risk assessment should remain proportional.

---

## Risk Levels

A simple conceptual model may include:

```text
LOW
MEDIUM
HIGH
CRITICAL
```

A formal risk system should only be introduced if needed.

---

## High-Risk Build Changes

Examples include:

* signing infrastructure;
* publication pipeline;
* dependency source change;
* release-candidate environment change;
* build credential introduction.

These require stronger review.

---

## Change Management

Build changes should follow a controlled lifecycle.

```text
Identify Need
    ↓
Design Change
    ↓
Assess Impact
    ↓
Implement
    ↓
Validate
    ↓
Document
    ↓
Adopt
    ↓
Monitor
```

---

## Backward Compatibility

Build changes should consider compatibility with:

* developer workflows;
* CI;
* plugins;
* documentation;
* release processes.

---

## Breaking Build Change

A breaking change should include:

* clear rationale;
* migration path;
* documentation;
* appropriate version/release handling.

---

## Deprecation

Deprecated build behavior should follow a transition process.

```text
Current
  ↓
Deprecated
  ↓
Warning
  ↓
Migration
  ↓
Removal
```

---

## Emergency Change Governance

Urgent fixes may require expedited review.

Emergency changes must still be:

* documented afterward;
* validated;
* reviewed retrospectively if normal governance was bypassed.

Urgency does not remove accountability.

---

## Governance Reviews

Periodic build reviews may evaluate:

* framework compliance;
* toolchain health;
* dependency health;
* CI alignment;
* artifact trust;
* technical debt;
* security posture.

Reviews should be evidence-driven.

---

## Build Architecture Review

Architecture review should ask:

```text
Are boundaries still clear?

Has CI accumulated hidden semantics?

Are artifact contracts stable?

Are dependencies controlled?

Is validation sufficient?

Is complexity proportional?
```

---

## Toolchain Review

Toolchain review should assess:

* obsolete tools;
* version drift;
* unsupported runtimes;
* duplicated capabilities;
* security findings.

---

## Dependency Review

Dependency review should assess:

* unused packages;
* stale versions;
* security findings;
* incompatible ranges;
* unnecessary dependencies.

---

## Artifact Review

Artifact review should assess:

* expected outputs;
* naming;
* metadata;
* integrity;
* release handoff.

---

## Automation Review

Automation review should determine whether CI still reflects canonical local build semantics.

---

## Governance Evidence

Governance may produce evidence such as:

* ADRs;
* RFCs;
* review records;
* exception records;
* validation reports;
* change history.

---

## Governance And Revision History

Significant framework changes should update `Revision-History.md`.

---

## Governance And Changelog

Release-relevant framework changes should update `CHANGELOG.md`.

---

## Governance And Manifest

Changes to document inventory or normative status should update `MANIFEST.md`.

---

## Governance And EPIC Metadata

Framework lifecycle status should remain synchronized with `EPIC.yaml` and related control documents.

---

## Compliance With Build Framework

Build implementations should conform to the normative expectations established by EPIC-BLD-001.

Compliance should be evaluated proportionally to build maturity.

Not every future-state capability is immediately mandatory.

---

## Compliance Categories

A conceptual model may distinguish:

```text
Required Now
Recommended
Future Maturity
```

This avoids treating strategic goals as immediate defects.

---

## Non-Compliance

Material non-compliance may require:

* remediation;
* exception;
* debt tracking;
* architecture review.

---

## Governance Enforcement

Governance should increasingly be supported through automation where practical.

Examples include:

* configuration validation;
* artifact checks;
* dependency checks;
* CI quality gates.

Automation must implement governance rather than replace judgment.

---

## Governance And Local Development

Governance should not make local development unnecessarily difficult.

Canonical local workflows should remain accessible.

Strong controls may be applied progressively in CI and release profiles.

---

## Governance And CI

CI is an important enforcement environment.

It may validate:

* canonical build command;
* source state;
* dependencies;
* artifacts;
* validation results.

CI should not introduce undocumented governance rules.

---

## Governance And Release

The Release Framework is a major downstream governance partner.

The Build Framework provides:

* trusted artifacts;
* validation evidence;
* integrity;
* metadata;
* build context.

Release Governance decides whether those outputs are promoted.

---

## Governance And Quality

The Quality Framework may use build evidence to enforce quality expectations.

Build Governance ensures the evidence remains reliable.

---

## Governance And Testing

Testing governance remains owned by EPIC-TST-001.

Build Governance determines how test evidence participates in build trust.

---

## Governance And Documentation

Documentation governance ensures Build Framework documents remain:

* complete;
* synchronized;
* current;
* traceable.

---

## Governance And Plugin Compliance

Plugin-specific build behavior may require compliance validation.

Build Governance must preserve Plugin Compliance Framework authority over compliance rules.

---

## Governance And Security

Security Architecture governs broader security requirements.

Build Governance ensures those requirements are integrated into build processes when applicable.

---

## Governance Anti-Pattern — Architecture By Script

A build script must not silently introduce architectural behavior without review.

---

## Governance Anti-Pattern — CI As Authority

CI configuration must not become the only place where build policy exists.

---

## Governance Anti-Pattern — Permanent Exception

Exceptions must not become invisible permanent architecture.

---

## Governance Anti-Pattern — Unowned Tool

A critical build tool without clear ownership becomes operational risk.

---

## Governance Anti-Pattern — Validation Removal For Convenience

Mandatory validation must not be weakened solely to make pipelines pass.

---

## Governance Anti-Pattern — Tool Proliferation

New build tools should not be added without considering existing capabilities.

---

## Governance Anti-Pattern — Silent Artifact Change

Artifact contract changes must not occur unnoticed through packaging configuration updates.

---

## Governance Anti-Pattern — Documentation Drift

Build architecture, implementation, and documentation must not diverge.

---

## Governance Maturity Model

FamilyOS Build Governance may evolve through:

```text
Level 1
Documented Ownership

    ↓

Level 2
Defined Review Rules

    ↓

Level 3
Architecture Governance

    ↓

Level 4
Automated Compliance Checks

    ↓

Level 5
Evidence-Driven Governance

    ↓

Level 6
Policy-Enforced Build Governance
```

Each level should be adopted according to real engineering needs.

---

## Governance Success Criteria

Build Governance is successful when FamilyOS can answer:

1. who owns build architecture;
2. who owns implementation and tooling;
3. how build changes are classified;
4. which changes require normal review;
5. which changes require ADR;
6. which changes require RFC;
7. how artifact contract changes are governed;
8. how validation changes are governed;
9. how exceptions are recorded;
10. how build debt is tracked;
11. how CI remains subordinate to canonical build semantics;
12. how security-sensitive changes are reviewed;
13. how framework documentation remains synchronized;
14. how build decisions remain traceable over time.

---

## Governance Invariants

The following invariants should remain true.

### Invariant 1

Significant build architecture changes must be explicit.

### Invariant 2

Canonical build responsibilities must have clear ownership.

### Invariant 3

CI must not become an independent build authority.

### Invariant 4

Mandatory validation must not be weakened accidentally.

### Invariant 5

Artifact contract changes must remain reviewable.

### Invariant 6

Exceptions must be documented.

### Invariant 7

Build debt must not remain invisible.

### Invariant 8

Framework boundaries must remain respected.

### Invariant 9

High-risk build changes must receive proportional review.

### Invariant 10

Governance decisions must remain traceable.

---

## Governance Model Summary

The canonical FamilyOS Build Governance model is:

```text
Define Ownership
      ↓
Define Standards
      ↓
Classify Changes
      ↓
Review
      ↓
Implement
      ↓
Validate
      ↓
Document
      ↓
Adopt
      ↓
Monitor
      ↓
Improve
```

This model allows build engineering to evolve without losing architectural coherence.

---

## Final Principle

The FamilyOS Build Governance model is founded on the following rule:

> Build systems must evolve through deliberate engineering decisions rather than through accumulated convenience.

Governance exists to preserve trust as FamilyOS grows.

It ensures that new tools, new build paths, new artifacts, new validations, and new automation remain part of one coherent engineering system.

A mature Build Framework is not one that never changes.

It is one that can change without losing control of why it works, who owns it, what it produces, and why its outputs remain trustworthy.
