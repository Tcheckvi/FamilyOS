# Build Framework

## 02 Vision

### Overview

EPIC-BLD-001 — Build Framework defines the long-term vision for build engineering within the FamilyOS ecosystem.

The objective is not merely to standardize a sequence of build commands.

The objective is to establish a durable engineering capability through which FamilyOS can transform controlled source state into trusted technical artifacts in a manner that is:

* reproducible;
* deterministic where feasible;
* traceable;
* observable;
* validated;
* automatable;
* secure;
* maintainable;
* scalable;
* governable.

The Build Framework provides the strategic direction required to ensure that FamilyOS build capabilities evolve consistently with the broader engineering platform.

---

## Build Vision

The FamilyOS Build Framework is guided by the following vision:

> Every FamilyOS artifact should be produced through a controlled, explainable, repeatable, and verifiable engineering process.

This vision requires build engineering to evolve beyond local execution and packaging convenience.

A FamilyOS build must ultimately allow engineers to understand:

```text
What was built?

From which source?

Using which dependencies?

Using which configuration?

Using which toolchain?

Inside which environment?

Through which build stages?

With which validations?

Which artifacts were produced?

Which evidence supports their trust?

Can the process be reproduced?
```

The Build Framework exists to make these questions answerable by design.

---

## Strategic Intent

The strategic intent of EPIC-BLD-001 is to make build engineering a predictable and reliable component of the FamilyOS Engineering Platform.

The target transformation is:

```text
Informal Build Practices
        ↓
Defined Build Model
        ↓
Standardized Build Execution
        ↓
Validated Build Processes
        ↓
Automated Build Workflows
        ↓
Reproducible Artifact Production
        ↓
Traceable and Trusted Artifacts
```

Each stage strengthens confidence without requiring unnecessary infrastructure before it is needed.

---

## Long-Term Vision

The long-term FamilyOS build environment should make it possible to execute a build from a controlled repository state and obtain artifacts whose origin, configuration, dependencies, and validation state can be understood without relying on undocumented developer knowledge.

Conceptually:

```text
Controlled Repository State
          ↓
Explicit Build Context
          ↓
Governed Build Pipeline
          ↓
Verified Execution
          ↓
Artifact Generation
          ↓
Evidence Generation
          ↓
Trusted Artifact
```

The resulting artifact should be suitable for controlled handoff to the Release Framework.

---

## Vision Principle 1 — Reproducibility

Reproducibility is a foundational property of the FamilyOS build vision.

A build should not depend unpredictably on the workstation, developer, shell session, or temporary environment from which it is executed.

The target principle is:

```text
Equivalent Controlled Inputs
            +
Equivalent Build Context
            ↓
Equivalent Build Outcome
```

Equivalent does not necessarily require bit-for-bit identity in every early-stage implementation.

However, significant differences must be explainable.

---

## Vision Principle 2 — Determinism

FamilyOS should progressively eliminate unnecessary non-determinism from build processes.

Sources of non-deterministic behavior may include:

* mutable dependency resolution;
* uncontrolled timestamps;
* unordered generation;
* environment-dependent configuration;
* implicit network state;
* random identifiers;
* host-specific paths;
* locally installed tooling.

The long-term target is:

```text
Known Inputs
     ↓
Known Transformation
     ↓
Predictable Output
```

Where non-determinism is unavoidable, it must be understood and documented.

---

## Vision Principle 3 — Traceability

Every trusted artifact should be traceable to the engineering state that produced it.

The target traceability chain is:

```text
Artifact
   ↓
Build Identifier
   ↓
Build Context
   ↓
Source Revision
```

Additional traceability may include:

* dependency state;
* toolchain versions;
* configuration profile;
* execution environment;
* validation evidence;
* integrity metadata.

Traceability is necessary for debugging, release confidence, auditing, maintenance, and incident investigation.

---

## Vision Principle 4 — Explicit Build Inputs

FamilyOS build behavior must progressively eliminate hidden inputs.

A build input is any information capable of materially influencing the output.

This includes more than source files.

Examples include:

```text
Source
Configuration
Dependencies
Lock Files
Templates
Schemas
Generated Inputs
Tool Versions
Runtime Version
Environment Variables
Policies
Build Profiles
```

The long-term build model should make significant inputs visible and governable.

---

## Vision Principle 5 — Controlled Environments

The Build Framework does not require every build environment to be physically identical.

It requires build-relevant environmental differences to be understood and controlled.

The strategic direction is:

```text
Unknown Host State
        ↓
Defined Environment Requirements
        ↓
Validated Build Environment
        ↓
Reproducible Build Context
```

Environment control strengthens both developer confidence and CI consistency.

---

## Vision Principle 6 — Governed Dependencies

Dependencies are part of the effective source of a build.

FamilyOS therefore treats dependency state as an important contributor to artifact identity and reproducibility.

The target model is:

```text
Declared Dependencies
        ↓
Controlled Resolution
        ↓
Known Dependency Set
        ↓
Build Execution
```

Dependency governance should progressively support:

* version control;
* locking;
* compatibility;
* integrity;
* security review;
* traceability;
* reproducibility.

---

## Vision Principle 7 — Governed Toolchain

Build tools influence build outputs.

The toolchain must therefore be treated as an engineering dependency.

Examples include:

* Python runtime;
* package builders;
* package managers;
* code generators;
* validation tools;
* documentation generators;
* archive tools;
* CI execution tools.

The long-term objective is to ensure that significant toolchain dependencies are known and reproducible.

---

## Vision Principle 8 — Validation Before Trust

The Build Framework distinguishes between a completed build and a trusted build.

The target progression is:

```text
Build Execution
      ↓
Artifact Production
      ↓
Validation
      ↓
Evidence
      ↓
Trust
```

Successful execution alone is not sufficient.

Validation must confirm that applicable requirements were satisfied.

---

## Vision Principle 9 — Artifact Identity

Artifacts must become explicit engineering objects rather than anonymous files.

A trusted artifact should progressively contain or reference sufficient metadata to establish:

* identity;
* type;
* source;
* build context;
* version context;
* integrity;
* validation status.

Conceptually:

```text
Artifact
│
├── Identity
├── Origin
├── Build Context
├── Integrity
└── Validation State
```

---

## Vision Principle 10 — Evidence By Design

Build evidence should emerge naturally from build execution.

It should not depend exclusively on manual reconstruction after a failure or incident.

Possible evidence includes:

* logs;
* manifests;
* checksums;
* tool versions;
* dependency information;
* configuration;
* build identifiers;
* validation reports;
* provenance metadata.

The strategic objective is:

```text
Build Execution
      ↓
Artifact + Evidence
```

rather than:

```text
Build Execution
      ↓
Artifact
      ↓
Later Investigation
      ↓
Attempted Reconstruction
```

---

## Vision Principle 11 — Local and CI Alignment

The FamilyOS build model must not fragment between developer environments and CI.

The strategic target is:

```text
Canonical Build Definition
          │
          ├── Local
          ├── CI
          └── Release Preparation
```

The execution environments may differ.

The underlying build semantics should not.

---

## Vision Principle 12 — Automation Without Hidden Logic

Automation is essential, but build architecture must not become hidden inside CI configuration.

The build definition should remain understandable independently of a specific automation platform.

The desired model is:

```text
Build Architecture
       ↓
Build Commands
       ↓
Automation Integration
```

not:

```text
CI Configuration
       ↓
Implicit Build Architecture
```

Automation should execute the framework, not define it accidentally.

---

## Vision Principle 13 — Clear Build and Release Separation

Build and release must remain distinct engineering responsibilities.

The Build Framework determines:

```text
Can this artifact be trusted as a build output?
```

The Release Framework determines:

```text
Should this artifact become an official release?
```

This separation creates a controlled promotion boundary.

---

## Vision Principle 14 — Security-Aware Build Engineering

The build process participates directly in the FamilyOS software supply chain.

The Build Framework must therefore evolve with security awareness.

The strategic direction includes:

* controlled dependency acquisition;
* trusted tooling;
* least-privilege automation;
* secret isolation;
* artifact integrity;
* provenance;
* validation;
* auditable build behavior.

The framework must create the foundation for stronger supply-chain controls without forcing premature complexity.

---

## Vision Principle 15 — Observable Build Systems

Build execution should become easy to understand and diagnose.

The build system should expose enough information to answer:

* which stage is running;
* which stage failed;
* why it failed;
* which inputs were involved;
* which artifact was produced;
* which validation failed;
* how long execution took.

Build observability supports both developer productivity and engineering governance.

---

## Vision Principle 16 — Failure As Controlled Feedback

Failure is not inherently negative.

A build system that rejects invalid state is protecting the platform.

The Build Framework should therefore evolve toward failures that are:

* early;
* deterministic;
* explicit;
* diagnosable;
* actionable.

The target behavior is:

```text
Invalid State
     ↓
Clear Failure
     ↓
Useful Evidence
     ↓
Corrective Action
```

---

## Vision Principle 17 — Maintainable Build Architecture

Build systems often become difficult to maintain because responsibilities accumulate in scripts, CI jobs, and local procedures.

FamilyOS must avoid this evolution.

Build architecture should remain:

* modular;
* documented;
* explicit;
* reviewable;
* testable where applicable;
* replaceable;
* governable.

No critical build behavior should depend permanently on undocumented tribal knowledge.

---

## Vision Principle 18 — Incremental Maturity

FamilyOS must not attempt to implement the most advanced possible build infrastructure immediately.

The Build Framework supports maturity in stages.

```text
Stage 1
Defined

Stage 2
Standardized

Stage 3
Validated

Stage 4
Automated

Stage 5
Reproducible

Stage 6
Traceable

Stage 7
Supply-Chain Assured
```

Each stage must solve a real engineering need.

---

## Vision Principle 19 — Tool Independence

The Build Framework defines concepts before tools.

Core concepts such as:

* build context;
* dependency state;
* artifact identity;
* validation;
* evidence;
* reproducibility;

must remain valid even if FamilyOS changes its concrete tooling.

This prevents architectural coupling to temporary technologies.

---

## Vision Principle 20 — Platform Scalability

FamilyOS may eventually contain:

* additional official plugins;
* multiple package types;
* generated artifacts;
* platform components;
* different runtime technologies;
* external integrations.

The Build Framework must therefore be scalable beyond the current Python-focused repository without prematurely becoming language-agnostic infrastructure for its own sake.

The principle is:

```text
Current Needs
     +
Stable Concepts
     ↓
Future-Compatible Architecture
```

---

## Target Build Experience

The long-term developer experience should be straightforward.

An engineer should be able to understand:

```text
1. What do I need?

2. What command do I run?

3. What will it build?

4. Which validations will execute?

5. Where are the artifacts?

6. Why did the build fail?

7. Can this result be trusted?
```

The framework should reduce cognitive load rather than add ceremonial complexity.

---

## Target Local Build Model

Local builds should provide rapid and representative feedback.

A target local model is:

```text
Developer Change
      ↓
Local Validation
      ↓
Canonical Build
      ↓
Local Artifact
      ↓
Artifact Verification
```

Local execution must remain practical while preserving alignment with canonical rules.

---

## Target CI Build Model

CI should provide standardized and independently repeatable execution.

```text
Repository Revision
       ↓
Controlled CI Environment
       ↓
Canonical Build Definition
       ↓
Automated Validation
       ↓
Artifact + Evidence
```

CI should strengthen confidence rather than introduce separate semantics.

---

## Target Release Candidate Model

Release candidate builds should operate under the strongest build controls required by the platform.

Possible characteristics include:

* known repository revision;
* clean source state;
* locked dependencies;
* validated toolchain;
* explicit build profile;
* complete validation;
* artifact metadata;
* checksums;
* provenance information;
* retained evidence.

The exact requirements may evolve together with EPIC-REL-001.

---

## Target Artifact Model

The future FamilyOS artifact should be treated as a traceable engineering object.

A conceptual model is:

```text
Artifact
│
├── Artifact ID
├── Artifact Type
├── Build ID
├── Source Revision
├── Build Profile
├── Dependency Context
├── Toolchain Context
├── Integrity Data
├── Validation State
└── Evidence References
```

Not every artifact must physically embed all of this information.

The information must be available through the build evidence model where required.

---

## Target Build Evidence Model

Evidence should support both automated decisions and human investigation.

A future evidence bundle may include:

```text
Build Evidence
│
├── Build Manifest
├── Source Information
├── Dependency Information
├── Toolchain Information
├── Environment Information
├── Validation Results
├── Artifact Manifest
├── Checksums
├── Logs
└── Provenance Data
```

Evidence requirements should remain proportional to artifact risk and platform maturity.

---

## Target Build Pipeline

The strategic target build pipeline is:

```text
Repository Revision
        ↓
Input Discovery
        ↓
Input Validation
        ↓
Dependency Resolution
        ↓
Configuration Resolution
        ↓
Environment Validation
        ↓
Build Preparation
        ↓
Build Execution
        ↓
Artifact Generation
        ↓
Artifact Identification
        ↓
Artifact Validation
        ↓
Evidence Generation
        ↓
Trusted Artifact
        ↓
Release Handoff
```

Some implementations may combine stages.

The conceptual responsibilities should remain identifiable.

---

## Build Architecture Vision

The Build Framework should evolve toward a layered architecture.

```text
Build Interface Layer
        ↓
Build Orchestration Layer
        ↓
Build Execution Layer
        ↓
Artifact Layer
        ↓
Validation and Evidence Layer
```

Supporting concerns include:

```text
Configuration
Dependencies
Environment
Toolchain
Governance
Observability
```

This architecture promotes separation of responsibilities and future adaptability.

---

## Build Interface Vision

Build operations should expose a consistent and understandable entry point.

The interface may evolve through:

* CLI commands;
* automation targets;
* task runners;
* CI integrations;
* internal APIs.

The interface must remain subordinate to the canonical build model.

---

## Build Orchestration Vision

Orchestration coordinates stages without embedding unnecessary implementation details.

Its responsibility is to understand:

```text
Which steps?

In which order?

Under which conditions?

With which dependencies?

What happens on failure?
```

Orchestration should remain explicit and testable where practical.

---

## Build Execution Vision

Execution performs the concrete transformations required to produce artifacts.

Examples may include:

* package construction;
* source generation;
* metadata generation;
* documentation generation;
* plugin packaging;
* manifest creation.

Execution mechanisms may vary while respecting common lifecycle rules.

---

## Artifact Layer Vision

The artifact layer should manage the technical outputs of build execution.

Its long-term responsibilities may include:

* artifact naming;
* identity;
* metadata;
* integrity;
* classification;
* storage handoff;
* validation state.

---

## Validation and Evidence Vision

Validation and evidence should surround the complete build lifecycle rather than exist only as an afterthought.

```text
          Validation
              ↓
Inputs → Build → Artifact
              ↓
           Evidence
```

This layer creates confidence in the resulting output.

---

## Build Governance Vision

Build governance should remain lightweight for ordinary changes while protecting significant architectural decisions.

A possible governance model is:

```text
Routine Build Change
        ↓
Code Review

Significant Build Change
        ↓
Architecture Review
        ↓
ADR or RFC when required
```

Governance should prevent fragmentation without creating unnecessary bureaucracy.

---

## Build Quality Vision

High-quality build engineering means more than successful automation.

The FamilyOS quality vision for builds includes:

* correctness;
* reproducibility;
* transparency;
* predictability;
* maintainability;
* diagnosability;
* traceability;
* security;
* efficiency.

These properties must reinforce one another.

---

## Build Security Vision

The Build Framework should progressively support stronger software supply-chain assurance.

Potential future capabilities may include:

* artifact signing;
* dependency verification;
* provenance attestations;
* isolated builders;
* immutable build environments;
* trusted artifact storage;
* automated policy enforcement.

These capabilities are strategic possibilities, not mandatory immediate implementation requirements.

---

## Build Performance Vision

Build performance must support productive engineering without sacrificing trust.

Optimization should follow the order:

```text
Correctness
    ↓
Reproducibility
    ↓
Validation
    ↓
Observability
    ↓
Performance Optimization
```

Caching and parallelism must not hide state or make results difficult to reproduce.

---

## Developer Experience Vision

A high-quality build experience should feel predictable.

The developer should not need to understand every internal implementation detail.

The system should provide:

* canonical commands;
* documented prerequisites;
* clear progress;
* clear failures;
* useful diagnostics;
* predictable artifact locations;
* consistent CI behavior.

The target is engineering confidence, not build-system sophistication.

---

## Documentation Vision

Every important build capability should be documented at the correct level.

Documentation should explain:

* purpose;
* architecture;
* inputs;
* outputs;
* configuration;
* execution;
* validation;
* failure behavior;
* governance.

Build knowledge must remain institutional rather than personal.

---

## Automation Vision

Automation should progressively reduce manual effort without reducing visibility.

A mature build automation flow should allow:

```text
Source Change
     ↓
Automated Build
     ↓
Automated Validation
     ↓
Artifact Generation
     ↓
Evidence Collection
     ↓
Release Readiness Assessment
```

Human review remains possible at governance boundaries.

---

## CI Integration Vision

CI should become an execution environment for the canonical build framework.

It should not redefine build semantics.

The long-term relationship is:

```text
Build Framework
      ↓
Canonical Build Definition
      ↓
CI Runner
```

This preserves portability between automation providers.

---

## Plugin Build Vision

The FamilyOS plugin architecture requires the build framework to support modular components.

A plugin build may eventually include:

```text
Plugin Source
     ↓
Metadata Validation
     ↓
Compliance Validation
     ↓
Plugin Build
     ↓
Artifact Validation
     ↓
Plugin Artifact
```

The core framework should enable this without becoming tied to individual plugin domains.

---

## Documentation Artifact Vision

Documentation can itself become a build artifact.

Possible examples include:

* generated API references;
* manifests;
* architecture indexes;
* specification bundles;
* compliance reports.

This means documentation generation should eventually participate in the same traceability and validation principles as other build outputs where appropriate.

---

## Multi-Artifact Vision

A single build may produce multiple related artifacts.

For example:

```text
Build
│
├── Package
├── Documentation
├── Manifest
├── Validation Report
└── Provenance Data
```

The Build Framework should support artifact sets without assuming a one-build-one-file model.

---

## Build Identity Vision

Every significant build should eventually have a stable identity.

A build identifier enables:

```text
Build ID
  │
  ├── Inputs
  ├── Configuration
  ├── Execution
  ├── Artifacts
  └── Evidence
```

This becomes especially valuable for CI, release, incident analysis, and provenance.

---

## Release Handoff Vision

The Build Framework should eventually expose a clear release handoff contract.

A conceptual handoff package may contain:

```text
Release Candidate Handoff
│
├── Artifact
├── Artifact Identity
├── Build Identity
├── Validation State
├── Integrity Data
└── Evidence
```

The Release Framework can then evaluate whether the candidate should be promoted.

---

## Future Build Maturity

The Build Framework must support future growth without requiring all future capabilities immediately.

A possible maturity trajectory is:

```text
Maturity 1
Documented Builds

Maturity 2
Standard Build Commands

Maturity 3
Automated Build Validation

Maturity 4
Controlled CI Builds

Maturity 5
Reproducible Environments

Maturity 6
Traceable Artifact Production

Maturity 7
Provenance-Aware Builds

Maturity 8
Policy-Driven Supply Chain
```

Progress between levels should depend on engineering value.

---

## Anti-Vision

The Build Framework explicitly rejects several undesirable future states.

FamilyOS must not evolve toward a build environment where:

* only one developer understands the build;
* build commands differ unpredictably between machines;
* critical behavior exists only in CI YAML;
* dependencies silently drift;
* artifacts cannot be traced to source;
* release artifacts are built manually without evidence;
* failures provide no useful diagnostics;
* build complexity grows without architectural control;
* local workflows and CI become unrelated systems;
* automation is mistaken for correctness.

These conditions are incompatible with the FamilyOS engineering vision.

---

## Vision Success Criteria

The Build Framework vision is realized when FamilyOS can consistently demonstrate that:

1. build inputs are known;
2. build configuration is explicit;
3. dependencies are controlled;
4. toolchain requirements are known;
5. environments are sufficiently reproducible;
6. build execution is standardized;
7. artifacts are identifiable;
8. artifacts are validated;
9. build evidence is available;
10. local and CI semantics are aligned;
11. build failures are diagnosable;
12. build governance is defined;
13. build automation remains transparent;
14. trusted artifacts can be handed to the Release Framework;
15. build complexity remains proportional to engineering needs.

---

## Vision Statement

The long-term FamilyOS build vision can be summarized as:

```text
Source alone is not enough.

A build command alone is not enough.

A generated artifact alone is not enough.

FamilyOS requires:

Controlled Inputs
       ↓
Controlled Transformation
       ↓
Verified Artifact
       ↓
Traceable Evidence
       ↓
Engineering Trust
```

---

## Final Vision

The FamilyOS Build Framework aims to make build engineering predictable enough to disappear as a source of uncertainty while remaining visible enough to be understood, governed, verified, and improved.

A developer should be able to trust that the canonical build process behaves consistently.

A maintainer should be able to understand how an artifact was produced.

Automation should be able to evaluate build state.

The Release Framework should receive artifacts whose origin and validation state are clear.

The platform should be able to evolve its tooling without losing its build principles.

This is the strategic vision established by EPIC-BLD-001.
