# Build Framework

## 22 Release

### Overview

EPIC-BLD-001 — Build Framework must itself follow a controlled completion and release process before becoming the authoritative FamilyOS Build Framework.

This document defines the release conditions for **EPIC-BLD-001 as an engineering framework**.

It does not define the general FamilyOS software release process.

That responsibility belongs to:

```text
EPIC-REL-001 — Release Framework
```

The distinction is fundamental.

This document answers:

> Under which conditions can EPIC-BLD-001 be declared complete, validated, versioned, and adopted as the official FamilyOS Build Framework?

The central principle is:

> The Build Framework may be released only when its structure, architecture, terminology, governance, cross-framework relationships, and control documents represent one coherent and validated engineering baseline.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to define the framework-level release process for EPIC-BLD-001.

It establishes requirements for:

* framework completion;
* structural readiness;
* documentation readiness;
* architectural readiness;
* validation;
* control-document synchronization;
* Git readiness;
* versioning;
* tagging;
* release evidence;
* post-release maintenance.

---

## Release Scope

This release process applies to the complete EPIC-BLD-001 documentation baseline.

The canonical numbered documents are:

```text
00-EPIC.md
01-Context.md
02-Vision.md
03-Build-Principles.md
04-Build-Architecture.md
05-Build-Lifecycle.md
06-Build-Input-Requirements.md
07-Build-Inputs-and-Project-Structure.md
08-Build-Toolchain.md
09-Build-Environment-Management.md
10-Dependency-Management.md
11-Build-Configuration.md
12-Build-Philosophy.md
13-Build-Execution.md
14-Artifact-Management.md
15-Build-Validation.md
16-Build-Governance.md
17-Build-Automation-and-CI.md
18-Roadmap.md
19-References.md
20-Validation.md
21-Summary.md
22-Release.md
23-Implementation-Checklist.md
```

The framework control documents are:

```text
EPIC-BLD-001.md
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

The expected final baseline therefore contains:

```text
24 numbered framework documents
+
7 control documents
=
31 canonical files
```

---

## Release Boundary

Framework release must not be confused with implementation release.

The relationship is:

```text
EPIC-BLD-001 Documentation
        ↓
Framework Validation
        ↓
Framework Release
        ↓
Authoritative Build Architecture
        ↓
Build Implementation
        ↓
Software Artifacts
        ↓
EPIC-REL-001
```

Releasing EPIC-BLD-001 establishes the architectural baseline.

It does not imply that every capability described by the framework is already implemented.

---

## Release Principle 1 — Architecture Before Implementation

The Build Framework should be released as an architectural foundation before implementation expands significantly.

This preserves the FamilyOS engineering approach:

```text
Architecture
    ↓
Governance
    ↓
Implementation
    ↓
Validation
    ↓
Evolution
```

---

## Release Principle 2 — Completion Is Not File Existence

A framework is not complete merely because all expected filenames exist.

Release requires:

```text
Structure
   +
Content
   +
Consistency
   +
Validation
   +
Governance
   +
Evidence
```

---

## Release Principle 3 — No Transitional Structure

Temporary restructuring artifacts must not remain in the released baseline.

Files such as:

```text
legacy-Introduction.md
legacy-Project-Structure.md
```

must be removed after confirming that any required content has been incorporated.

---

## Release Principle 4 — One Canonical Chapter Per Number

The released framework must contain exactly one canonical numbered chapter for each number from `00` through `23`.

Duplicate numbering is prohibited.

---

## Release Principle 5 — Control Documents Must Agree

The framework must not reach release with contradictory status information.

The following must represent the same framework state:

```text
EPIC.yaml
EPIC-BLD-001.md
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

---

## Release Principle 6 — Validation Precedes Release

Release cannot be used as a substitute for validation.

The sequence is:

```text
Complete
   ↓
Validate
   ↓
Resolve Findings
   ↓
Record Evidence
   ↓
Release
```

---

## Release Principle 7 — Framework Release Does Not Authorize Software Publication

EPIC-BLD-001 release establishes Build Framework authority.

It does not authorize publication of FamilyOS software artifacts.

Software release remains governed by EPIC-REL-001.

---

## Release Readiness Model

Framework release readiness is composed of:

```text
Release Readiness
│
├── Structural Readiness
├── Content Readiness
├── Architectural Readiness
├── Integration Readiness
├── Governance Readiness
├── Validation Readiness
├── Control Document Readiness
├── Repository Readiness
└── Versioning Readiness
```

All mandatory domains must pass before release.

---

## Structural Readiness

Structural readiness requires the final canonical tree.

The expected structure is:

```text
EPIC-BLD-001-build-framework/
├── 00-EPIC.md
├── 01-Context.md
├── 02-Vision.md
├── 03-Build-Principles.md
├── 04-Build-Architecture.md
├── 05-Build-Lifecycle.md
├── 06-Build-Input-Requirements.md
├── 07-Build-Inputs-and-Project-Structure.md
├── 08-Build-Toolchain.md
├── 09-Build-Environment-Management.md
├── 10-Dependency-Management.md
├── 11-Build-Configuration.md
├── 12-Build-Philosophy.md
├── 13-Build-Execution.md
├── 14-Artifact-Management.md
├── 15-Build-Validation.md
├── 16-Build-Governance.md
├── 17-Build-Automation-and-CI.md
├── 18-Roadmap.md
├── 19-References.md
├── 20-Validation.md
├── 21-Summary.md
├── 22-Release.md
├── 23-Implementation-Checklist.md
├── CHANGELOG.md
├── EPIC-BLD-001.md
├── EPIC.yaml
├── MANIFEST.md
├── README.md
├── Revision-History.md
└── VALIDATION.md
```

---

## Structural Release Gate

The structural gate fails if:

* a required file is missing;
* a numbered chapter is duplicated;
* a normative file is empty;
* a migration file remains;
* an unexpected temporary file remains;
* `MANIFEST.md` disagrees with the actual tree.

---

## Content Readiness

Every numbered chapter must fulfill its assigned responsibility.

Release review must confirm that the framework collectively defines:

* context;
* vision;
* principles;
* architecture;
* lifecycle;
* inputs;
* project structure;
* toolchain;
* environment;
* dependencies;
* configuration;
* philosophy;
* execution;
* artifacts;
* validation;
* governance;
* automation;
* roadmap;
* references;
* framework validation;
* summary;
* framework release;
* implementation checklist.

---

## Content Quality Gate

Release should fail if a chapter:

* remains placeholder content;
* primarily contains inherited content from another framework;
* contradicts another normative chapter;
* does not match its filename;
* creates unclear responsibility boundaries.

---

## Architectural Readiness

The released framework must define one coherent Build Architecture.

The architecture should remain recognizable as:

```text
Controlled Inputs
      ↓
Build Context Resolution
      ↓
Environment Preparation
      ↓
Validation
      ↓
Build Execution
      ↓
Candidate Artifacts
      ↓
Artifact Validation
      ↓
Build Evidence
      ↓
Trusted Artifact Set
      ↓
Release Handoff
```

---

## Architectural Release Gate

The architectural gate requires agreement between:

* `03-Build-Principles.md`;
* `04-Build-Architecture.md`;
* `05-Build-Lifecycle.md`;
* `12-Build-Philosophy.md`;
* `13-Build-Execution.md`;
* `14-Artifact-Management.md`;
* `15-Build-Validation.md`;
* `16-Build-Governance.md`;
* `17-Build-Automation-and-CI.md`.

---

## Build Trust Release Gate

The framework must consistently preserve:

```text
Build Success
      ≠
Artifact Trust
```

and:

```text
Artifact Trust
      ≠
Release Approval
```

These distinctions are mandatory.

---

## Artifact Model Readiness

Before release, EPIC-BLD-001 must consistently distinguish:

```text
Raw Output
    ↓
Candidate Artifact
    ↓
Validated Artifact
    ↓
Trusted Artifact
```

The terminology must not drift between chapters.

---

## Build Evidence Readiness

The framework must provide a coherent evidence model.

Build Evidence may include:

```text
Source Revision
Build ID
Effective Configuration
Dependency State
Toolchain State
Environment State
Validation Results
Artifact Manifest
Integrity Information
```

Not every profile must produce every evidence element.

The architecture must support proportional evidence.

---

## Integration Readiness

EPIC-BLD-001 must integrate cleanly with surrounding FamilyOS frameworks.

---

## Engineering Foundation Integration

EPIC-BLD-001 must remain aligned with:

```text
EPIC-ENG-001 — Engineering Foundation
```

The Build Framework specializes engineering principles rather than replacing them.

---

## Testing Integration

EPIC-BLD-001 must remain aligned with:

```text
EPIC-TST-001 — Testing Framework
```

Build may consume test evidence.

Testing semantics remain external.

---

## Quality Integration

EPIC-BLD-001 must remain aligned with:

```text
EPIC-QLT-001 — Quality Framework
```

Build may produce evidence for quality gates.

Quality governance remains external.

---

## Documentation Integration

EPIC-BLD-001 must remain aligned with:

```text
EPIC-DOC-001 — Documentation Framework
```

Documentation standards remain externally governed.

---

## Plugin Compliance Integration

Official plugin builds must remain compatible with:

```text
EPIC-PLUGIN-002 — Plugin Compliance Framework
```

Build automation may invoke compliance validation without redefining compliance policy.

---

## Release Framework Integration

The most important downstream integration is:

```text
EPIC-REL-001 — Release Framework
```

The boundary must remain:

```text
EPIC-BLD-001
     ↓
Trusted Artifact + Evidence
     ↓
EPIC-REL-001
     ↓
Release Decision + Publication
```

---

## Governance Readiness

`16-Build-Governance.md` must define sufficient governance for the released framework.

The release baseline must establish:

* ownership;
* change classification;
* review expectations;
* ADR relationship;
* RFC relationship;
* exception handling;
* technical debt handling;
* risk awareness.

---

## Validation Readiness

Framework validation is governed by:

```text
20-Validation.md
```

Release must not proceed until mandatory validation criteria pass.

---

## Validation Evidence

The final validation may include evidence such as:

```text
tree
find
wc
grep
git status
```

combined with semantic architectural review.

Automated structural checks do not replace manual architectural validation.

---

## Validation Findings

Release must not proceed with unresolved:

```text
CRITICAL
```

or:

```text
MAJOR
```

framework findings.

Minor findings may only remain when explicitly accepted and recorded.

---

## VALIDATION.md

The control document:

```text
VALIDATION.md
```

must record the actual final validation outcome.

Its final status should only become:

```text
VALIDATED
```

after validation is complete.

---

## MANIFEST.md

`MANIFEST.md` must represent the canonical released file set.

It should contain no references to removed inherited or migration documents.

---

## EPIC.yaml

Before release, `EPIC.yaml` should be reviewed for:

* EPIC identifier;
* title;
* status;
* scope;
* dependencies;
* deliverables;
* decisions;
* lifecycle state.

The status should reflect actual framework completion.

---

## README.md

`README.md` should provide correct navigation and framework status.

It should not describe obsolete structure.

---

## CHANGELOG.md

The changelog should record the completion of the Build Framework baseline.

The release entry should summarize significant framework changes, including restructuring from the inherited generic engineering layout where appropriate.

---

## Revision-History.md

Revision history should provide traceability of meaningful framework evolution.

It may record:

* initial baseline;
* structural migration;
* Build-specific specialization;
* final validation;
* framework release.

---

## EPIC-BLD-001.md

The EPIC summary document should align with `00-EPIC.md`.

The two documents must not present conflicting scope or completion criteria.

---

## Implementation Checklist Readiness

`23-Implementation-Checklist.md` must exist and be complete before framework release.

Its purpose is to bridge:

```text
Normative Architecture
        ↓
Implementation Work
```

The checklist may contain future implementation items.

Those items do not necessarily block release of the architectural framework.

---

## Framework Completion Versus Implementation Completion

This distinction is mandatory.

```text
Framework Complete
       ≠
Implementation Complete
```

EPIC-BLD-001 may be closed as a framework while implementation work remains on the roadmap.

---

## Framework Versioning

The Build Framework should participate in FamilyOS repository versioning conventions.

The framework release should correspond to an identifiable Git commit.

---

## Release Commit

The release commit should contain the complete validated Build Framework baseline.

It should not include unrelated accidental modifications where avoidable.

---

## Release Commit Message

A release commit message should clearly identify framework completion.

A suitable convention is conceptually:

```text
docs(build): complete EPIC-BLD-001 Build Framework
```

The exact repository convention remains governed by FamilyOS engineering standards.

---

## Git Tag

A completed Build Framework baseline may receive an annotated Git tag.

The tag should follow the established FamilyOS versioning sequence.

The exact version must be selected from repository state at release time rather than guessed by the framework documentation.

---

## Tag Meaning

The tag identifies:

```text
Validated EPIC-BLD-001 Baseline
```

It does not imply that all future Build Framework roadmap capabilities are implemented.

---

## Annotated Tag

An annotated tag is preferred where repository conventions require release metadata.

A conceptual message is:

```text
EPIC-BLD-001 Build Framework completed
```

---

## Remote Publication

After the release commit and tag are verified locally, they may be pushed to the canonical repository according to normal FamilyOS Git governance.

---

## Release Evidence

Framework release evidence should include at minimum:

```text
Final Commit
Final Tree
Validation Result
Framework Version
Git Tag
```

Additional evidence may include:

* file count;
* validation commands;
* Git status;
* commit hash;
* change summary.

---

## Clean Working Tree

After final commit, the preferred repository state is:

```text
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

This provides a clear framework release boundary.

---

## Pre-Release Git Review

Before committing the final framework, review:

```text
git status --short
git diff
git diff --cached
```

as appropriate.

The purpose is to verify that all intended migrations and additions are represented correctly.

---

## Structural Migration Review

Because EPIC-BLD-001 originated from an inherited generic framework structure, release review must specifically verify renamed and removed documents.

The final baseline must no longer use obsolete canonical chapters such as:

```text
03-Engineering-Principles.md
04-Repository-Architecture.md
05-Development-Workflow.md
06-Coding-Standards.md
07-Project-Structure.md
08-Toolchain.md
09-Environment-Management.md
11-Configuration-Management.md
13-Testing-Philosophy.md
14-Documentation-Philosophy.md
15-Quality-Philosophy.md
16-Technical-Governance.md
17-Engineering-Lifecycle.md
```

Historical references may remain only when intentionally describing migration history.

---

## Legacy Removal

Before final commit:

```text
legacy-Introduction.md
legacy-Project-Structure.md
```

must be removed after confirming that required content has been preserved elsewhere.

---

## Release Candidate State

Before final framework release, EPIC-BLD-001 may conceptually enter:

```text
RELEASE_CANDIDATE
```

during final validation.

This state is useful when documentation is complete but final validation is still underway.

---

## Framework Status Lifecycle

A conceptual lifecycle is:

```text
DRAFT
  ↓
IN_PROGRESS
  ↓
REVIEW
  ↓
RELEASE_CANDIDATE
  ↓
VALIDATED
  ↓
COMPLETED
```

Exact status values should remain consistent with FamilyOS EPIC governance.

---

## Release Gate Model

The complete release gate is:

```text
Structure PASS
      +
Content PASS
      +
Architecture PASS
      +
Integration PASS
      +
Governance PASS
      +
Validation PASS
      +
Control Documents PASS
      +
Git Review PASS
      ↓
EPIC-BLD-001 RELEASE READY
```

---

## Release Failure

Release must stop when a mandatory gate fails.

The expected response is:

```text
Finding
   ↓
Correction
   ↓
Revalidation
   ↓
Release Review
```

Release pressure must not bypass framework validation.

---

## Post-Release Status

After release, EPIC-BLD-001 becomes the authoritative Build Framework baseline.

Future changes should be classified as:

* correction;
* clarification;
* compatible extension;
* significant revision;
* architectural change.

---

## Post-Release Corrections

Minor documentation corrections may be made without reopening the entire EPIC when they do not change architecture.

Examples include:

* spelling;
* broken internal references;
* formatting;
* minor clarification.

---

## Compatible Extensions

New guidance may be added when it remains compatible with existing framework principles.

Such changes should update relevant control documents.

---

## Significant Revisions

Significant changes may require a new framework revision.

Examples include:

* new artifact trust model;
* major Build Context changes;
* new canonical lifecycle stages;
* major dependency model changes;
* new release handoff semantics.

---

## Architectural Changes

Architectural changes may require:

```text
ADR
```

or:

```text
RFC
```

depending on scope and FamilyOS governance.

---

## Framework Evolution

The released Build Framework should remain stable enough to guide implementation while still allowing controlled evolution.

The intended model is:

```text
Stable Core
   +
Governed Evolution
```

---

## Roadmap After Release

Framework release activates the implementation roadmap defined in:

```text
18-Roadmap.md
```

The next maturity steps may include:

* canonical build interface;
* standardized build environment;
* stronger dependency reproducibility;
* artifact validation;
* CI integration;
* Build IDs;
* evidence generation;
* release handoff.

---

## Relationship With EPIC-REL-001 After Closure

Once EPIC-BLD-001 is validated, FamilyOS can proceed more confidently with EPIC-REL-001 because the upstream artifact contract is defined.

The relationship becomes:

```text
EPIC-BLD-001
COMPLETED
    ↓
Trusted Artifact Contract Established
    ↓
EPIC-REL-001
Can Define Release Lifecycle
```

---

## Release Anti-Pattern — Tag Before Validation

A framework must not be tagged as complete before mandatory validation passes.

---

## Release Anti-Pattern — Tagging Transitional State

Temporary migration files or duplicate chapter numbers must not be included in the final framework tag.

---

## Release Anti-Pattern — Version Guessing

The framework documentation must not assume the next repository version without checking actual Git history.

---

## Release Anti-Pattern — Hidden Uncommitted Changes

The final release boundary should not depend on unrelated or forgotten working-tree modifications.

---

## Release Anti-Pattern — Closing With Placeholder Documents

Every normative chapter must contain substantive framework content before closure.

---

## Release Anti-Pattern — Framework Equals Implementation

The architectural framework may be complete while implementation continues.

Conflating these states creates misleading project status.

---

## Release Anti-Pattern — Build Framework Publishing Software

EPIC-BLD-001 does not own official software publication.

That boundary belongs to EPIC-REL-001.

---

30. no unresolved critical or major findings remain.

---

## Release Success Criteria

EPIC-BLD-001 is ready for release when FamilyOS can confidently answer:

1. what the Build Framework owns;
2. what it does not own;
3. how build inputs are controlled;
4. how Build Context is defined;
5. how execution occurs;
6. how artifacts are identified;
7. how artifacts become trusted;
8. what evidence supports trust;
9. how automation executes the architecture;
10. how governance controls change;
11. how trusted artifacts reach the Release Framework;
12. which implementation capabilities remain future roadmap work;
13. which exact repository revision represents the validated framework.

---

## Release Invariants

The following invariants must hold at release.

### Invariant 1

The released framework has exactly one canonical chapter for every number from `00` through `23`.

### Invariant 2

No temporary migration document remains.

### Invariant 3

The framework has passed structural and semantic validation.

### Invariant 4

Control documents describe the same framework state.

### Invariant 5

Build trust remains distinct from release authorization.

### Invariant 6

EPIC-REL-001 remains responsible for software release governance.

### Invariant 7

The release baseline corresponds to an identifiable Git commit.

### Invariant 8

The release tag corresponds to the validated framework state.

### Invariant 9

Framework completion does not falsely claim implementation completion.

### Invariant 10

Future framework evolution remains governed.

---

```

---

## Final Principle

The release of EPIC-BLD-001 is founded on the following rule:

> FamilyOS should not declare its Build Framework complete until the framework itself demonstrates the structural discipline, traceability, validation, and governance that it expects from the builds it defines.

Framework release is therefore not a ceremonial Git tag.

It is the point at which FamilyOS establishes a stable architectural contract for transforming controlled engineering state into trustworthy software artifacts.

Once EPIC-BLD-001 is validated and released, FamilyOS has an authoritative Build Framework upon which implementation, automation, artifact trust, reproducibility, and the Release Framework can safely build.
