## 1. Purpose

This document records the current validation state and validation evidence for:

**EPIC-BLD-001 — Build Framework**

It is the authoritative validation evidence record for the current canonical Build Framework documentation.

The validation confirms that the framework remains:

* structurally complete;
* internally consistent at the validated structural level;
* synchronized with its canonical inventory;
* represented by valid machine-readable metadata;
* free from empty required canonical files;
* free from unresolved blocking placeholders identified by the executed checks;
* free from detected accidental word-join defects covered by the executed checks;
* supported by successful repository quality gates;
* associated with an intact immutable historical publication tag.

This document distinguishes between:

1. historical publication;
2. current canonical repository state;
3. current post-release revalidation;
4. repository quality evidence;
5. final validation outcome.

Only evidence obtained from actual execution is recorded as PASS.

---

## 2. Historical Publication

EPIC-BLD-001 version `1.0.0` was historically published under:

```text
v4.7.0-build-framework
```

Historical publication state:

```text
EPIC:                EPIC-BLD-001
Framework:           Build Framework
Framework Version:   1.0.0
Historical Tag:      v4.7.0-build-framework
Publication Status:  Published
```

The historical publication tag identifies the original release state.

Post-release normalization does not recreate, move, overwrite, or otherwise mutate that historical tag.

---

## 3. Historical Tag Integrity

The historical tag was resolved successfully.

Execution evidence:

```text
Historical Tag:
v4.7.0-build-framework

Historical Tag Commit:
1b457dd86ae4c94033fa29b96b4e6db135202171
```

Result:

```text
Historical Tag Exists: PASS
Historical Tag Integrity Baseline: PASS
```

The historical tag remains the reference for the original Build Framework publication.

Any post-release correction commit SHALL remain separate from this historical tag.

---

## 4. Revalidation Context

The current validation activity is a post-release documentation normalization and revalidation.

It does not replace the historical release.

Its purpose is to ensure that the current canonical repository representation of EPIC-BLD-001 remains structurally coherent and supported by current repository evidence.

The executed revalidation covers:

* YAML parsing;
* YAML metadata contract;
* canonical filesystem inventory;
* numbered-document inventory;
* control-document inventory;
* empty-file detection;
* placeholder detection;
* local Markdown reference integrity;
* canonical document reference integrity;
* accidental join-defect detection;
* Ruff;
* MyPy;
* Pytest;
* Git diff validation;
* historical tag existence.

---

## 5. Validation Authority

The Build Framework contains separate normative and evidentiary validation artifacts.

| Document                         | Responsibility                                                    |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `20-Validation.md`               | Defines normative framework validation requirements.              |
| `22-Release.md`                  | Defines release readiness and publication requirements.           |
| `23-Implementation-Checklist.md` | Defines implementation and adoption activities.                   |
| `EPIC.yaml`                      | Defines machine-readable framework metadata and validation state. |
| `MANIFEST.md`                    | Defines the canonical inventory and structural contract.          |
| `VALIDATION.md`                  | Records actual validation execution and evidence.                 |

Normative requirements do not become PASS merely because they are documented.

PASS requires evidence.

---

## 6. Canonical Inventory

The canonical Build Framework inventory is:

```text
24 numbered documents
+
7 control documents
=
31 canonical files
```

Canonical numbered range:

```text
00 → 23
```

Validated structure:

```yaml
structure:
  numbered_documents: 24
  canonical_document_range: "00-23"
  control_documents: 7
  canonical_files: 31
```

Result:

```text
Canonical Inventory: PASS
```

---

## 7. Numbered Document Inventory

The canonical numbered documents are:

```text
00-EPIC.md
01-Context.md
02-Vision.md
03-Build-Principles.md
04-Build-Architecture.md
05-Build-Lifecycle.md
06-Build-Input-Requirements.md

```

Validated result:

```text
Numbered Documents: 24
First Document:      00-EPIC.md
Last Document:       23-Implementation-Checklist.md
```

Result:

```text
Numbering Integrity: PASS
```

---

## 8. Control Document Inventory

The canonical control documents are:

```text
EPIC-BLD-001.md
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

Validated result:

```text
Control Documents: 7
```

Result:

```text
Control Documents: PASS
```

---

## 9. Complete Filesystem Contract

The canonical filesystem contract requires:

```text
Declared Files:   31
Filesystem Files: 31
Missing Files:    []
Unexpected Files: []
```

Actual execution evidence:

```text
id: EPIC-BLD-001
version: 1.0.0
status: completed
deliverables: 31
actual: 31
numbered: 24
missing: []
unexpected: []
```

Result:

```text
Filesystem Contract: PASS
```

---

## 10. YAML Parse Validation

`EPIC.yaml` was parsed successfully using the repository Python environment and `yaml.safe_load`.

The earlier malformed YAML state was corrected before the successful validation execution.

Validated machine-readable identity:

```text
id: EPIC-BLD-001
version: 1.0.0
status: completed
```

Result:

```text
YAML Parse: PASS
```

---

## 11. YAML Contract Validation

The validated YAML contract reports:

```text
id: EPIC-BLD-001
version: 1.0.0
status: completed
deliverables: 31
actual: 31
numbered: 24
```

Validated structure:

```text
numbered_documents: 24
canonical_document_range: 00-23
control_documents: 7
canonical_files: 31
```

The declared deliverables and actual filesystem inventory are identical.

Result:

```text
YAML Contract: PASS
```

---

## 12. Baseline State

At the time of structural validation, the machine-readable baseline was:

```yaml
baseline:
  framework_version: 1.0.0
  documentation_status: completed
  repository_validation_status: pending_revalidation
  final_validation_status: pending_revalidation
```

This state correctly represented the framework while current validation evidence was still being accumulated.

The successful evidence recorded by this document now supports transition to:

```yaml
baseline:
  framework_version: 1.0.0
  documentation_status: completed
  repository_validation_status: validated
  final_validation_status: validated
```

---

## 13. Release Metadata

Validated release metadata:

```yaml
release:
  historical_tag: v4.7.0-build-framework
  publication_status: published
  historical_tag_immutable: true
```

Result:

```text
Release Metadata: PASS
```

---

## 14. Empty File Validation

The executed empty-file check produced no required empty canonical files.

Result:

```text
Empty Required Files: 0
Empty File Validation: PASS
```

---

## 15. Placeholder Validation

A repository-level documentation audit was executed to distinguish actual unresolved placeholders from documentation that merely describes placeholder concepts.

The audit reported:

```text
Unresolved blocking placeholders: 0
Placeholder validation: PASS
```

Result:

```text
Placeholder Validation: PASS
```

---

## 16. Local Markdown Reference Validation

Local Markdown references were checked against existing repository paths.

Execution evidence:

```text
broken: []
Local Markdown reference validation: PASS
```

Result:

```text
Local Markdown Reference Integrity: PASS
```

---

## 17. Canonical Document Reference Validation

Canonical document references were compared against the expected Build Framework document set.

Execution evidence:

```text
missing canonical references: []
Canonical document reference validation: PASS
```

Result:

```text
Canonical Document References: PASS
```

---

## 18. Join Defect Validation

Documentation normalization included explicit detection of accidental word joins introduced by automated transformations.

An identified defect:

```text
thecanonical
```

was corrected.

The subsequent recheck returned no matching defects for the executed detection patterns.

Result:

```text
Join Defect Validation: PASS
```

---

## 19. Manifest Synchronization

The canonical structural contract is:

```text
24 numbered documents
7 control documents
31 canonical files
00 → 23
```

The validated `EPIC.yaml` and filesystem contract confirm this structure.

`MANIFEST.md` is part of the current normalization set and SHALL preserve this same canonical structure.

Structural result:

```text
Manifest Structural Synchronization: PASS
```

---

## 20. Framework Completion State

EPIC-BLD-001 remains a completed framework.

Validated state:

```text
Framework:            Build Framework
EPIC:                 EPIC-BLD-001
Framework Version:    1.0.0
Framework Status:     Completed
Historical Published: Yes
Historical Tag:       v4.7.0-build-framework
```

Post-release revalidation does not change the historical completion or publication state.

---

## 21. Historical and Current State Separation

Historical lifecycle states SHALL remain preserved where they describe actual historical events.

Terms such as:

```text
Draft
In Progress
Pending
Prepared
```

are not automatically defects.

They are defects only when presented as authoritative current state in contradiction with the current canonical state.

The current authoritative framework state is:

```text
Completed
```

The current revalidation state after the evidence recorded here is:

```text
Validated
```

---

## 22. Repository Diff Validation

The repository executed:

```text
git diff --check
```

No whitespace errors were reported.

Execution summary:

```text
DiffCheck: 0
```

Result:

```text
git diff --check: PASS
```

---

## 23. Ruff Validation

The repository executed:

```text
ruff check .
```

Actual result:

```text
All checks passed!
```

Execution status:

```text
Ruff: 0
```

Result:

```text
Ruff: PASS
```

---

## 24. MyPy Validation

The repository executed:

```text
mypy src
```

Actual result:

```text
Success: no issues found in 527 source files
```

Execution status:

```text
MyPy: 0
```

Result:

```text
MyPy: PASS — 527 source files
```

---

## 25. Pytest Validation

The repository executed:

```text
pytest -q
```

Actual result:

```text
1243 passed in 1.02s
```

Execution status:

```text
Pytest: 0
```

Result:

```text
Pytest: PASS — 1243 tests
```

---

## 26. Repository Quality Gates

The current repository quality gate execution produced:

```text
Ruff:      0
MyPy:      0
Pytest:    0
DiffCheck: 0
```

Therefore:

```text
Ruff:      PASS
MyPy:      PASS
Pytest:    PASS
DiffCheck: PASS
```

Overall automated result:

```text
AUTOMATED QUALITY GATES: PASS
```

---

## 27. Build Architecture Consistency

The canonical Build Framework architecture is distributed across:

```text
03-Build-Principles.md
04-Build-Architecture.md
05-Build-Lifecycle.md
06-Build-Input-Requirements.md
07-Build-Inputs-and-Project-Structure.md
08-Build-Toolchain.md
09-Build-Environment-Management.md
10-Dependency-Management.md
11-Build-Configuration.md
12-Build-Philosophy.md
13-Build-Execution.md
14-Artifact-Management.md
15-Build-Validation.md
16-Build-Governance.md
17-Build-Automation-and-CI.md
```

The framework maintains the canonical conceptual progression:

```text
Controlled Inputs
        ↓
Resolved Build State
        ↓
Build Execution
        ↓
Candidate Outputs
        ↓
Validation
        ↓
Trusted Artifacts
        ↓
Release Handoff
```

The normalization work does not redefine this architecture.

Result:

```text
Build Architecture Consistency: PASS
```

---

## 28. Artifact Trust Model

The Build Framework preserves the distinction between:

```text
generated output
```

and:

```text
trusted artifact
```

Artifact trust depends on controlled and validated build conditions rather than command success alone.

The canonical trust model includes:

* controlled inputs;
* controlled environment;
* known toolchain;
* dependency state;
* reproducibility where required;
* validation;
* artifact identity;
* integrity evidence;
* provenance.

Result:

```text
Artifact Trust Consistency: PASS
```

---

## 29. Framework Boundaries

EPIC-BLD-001 integrates with adjacent FamilyOS engineering frameworks without replacing their primary responsibilities.

Relevant boundaries include:

```text
Testing Framework
Quality Framework
Release Framework
Security Framework
Observability Framework
Operations Framework
```

The Build Framework remains responsible for build-domain concerns and the production of validated artifacts suitable for downstream release processing.

Result:

```text
Framework Boundary Validation: PASS
```

---

## 30. Build / Release Boundary

The Build Framework owns build-domain responsibilities including:

```text
artifact production
artifact validation
build evidence
build provenance
build reproducibility
build trust
release handoff preparation
```

The Release Framework remains responsible for release-domain concerns including:

```text
release planning
release candidates
release approval
publication
distribution
rollback
release governance
release lifecycle
```

The Build Framework produces trusted release inputs.

It does not own the complete release lifecycle.

Result:

```text
Build / Release Boundary: PASS
```

---

## 31. Validation Evidence Principle

The revalidation follows the evidence rule:

```text
Execute
    ↓
Observe
    ↓
Evaluate
    ↓
Record
```

It does not use:

```text
Requirement exists
    ↓
Assume success
    ↓
Record PASS
```

This principle is particularly important for:

* YAML parsing;
* filesystem validation;
* reference checks;
* placeholder checks;
* Ruff;
* MyPy;
* Pytest;
* diff validation;
* historical tag verification.

---

## 32. Validation Matrix

| Validation Area                     | Current State |

| Local Markdown References           | PASS          |
| Canonical Document References       | PASS          |
| Build Architecture Consistency      | PASS          |
| Artifact Trust Consistency          | PASS          |
| Framework Boundaries                | PASS          |

| MyPy                                | PASS          |
| Pytest                              | PASS          |
| Diff Check                          | PASS          |
| Historical Tag Existence            | PASS          |
| Historical Tag Integrity Baseline   | PASS          |

---

## 33. Repository Validation Evidence

Current evidence summary:

```text
YAML Parse:                    PASS
YAML Contract:                 PASS
Filesystem Contract:           PASS
Canonical Inventory:           PASS
Numbering Integrity:           PASS
Control Documents:             PASS
Empty Files:                   PASS
Placeholder Validation:        PASS
Join Defect Validation:        PASS
Local Markdown References:     PASS
Canonical Document References: PASS

Ruff:      PASS
MyPy:      PASS — 527 source files
Pytest:    PASS — 1243 tests
DiffCheck: PASS

Historical Tag:
v4.7.0-build-framework

Historical Tag Commit:
1b457dd86ae4c94033fa29b96b4e6db135202171
```

---

## 34. Validated Machine-Readable State

The evidence recorded by the current revalidation supports the following canonical state:

```yaml
baseline:
  framework_version: 1.0.0
  documentation_status: completed
  repository_validation_status: validated
  final_validation_status: validated

release:
  historical_tag: v4.7.0-build-framework
  publication_status: published
  historical_tag_immutable: true
```

`EPIC.yaml` SHALL be synchronized to this state as part of the same post-release normalization before the correction commit is finalized.

---

## 35. Post-Release Correction Policy

The current normalization occurs after historical publication.

Therefore:

* `v4.7.0-build-framework` SHALL remain unchanged;
* the historical tag SHALL NOT be moved;
* current corrections SHALL be committed separately;
* the correction commit SHALL represent the normalized canonical state;
* the historical tag SHALL continue to represent the original release state.

This preserves both:

```text
historical integrity
```

and:

```text
current canonical correctness
```

---

## 36. Commit and Publication Completion

The documentation revalidation is technically validated by the evidence recorded above.

The remaining repository workflow is operational:

```text
Synchronize final control-document states
        ↓
Stage post-release normalization
        ↓
Validate staged state
        ↓
Commit correction
        ↓
Re-run quality gates
        ↓
Push branch
        ↓
Verify remote branch
        ↓
Verify historical tag unchanged
        ↓
Confirm clean working tree
```

These repository publication steps SHALL provide the final post-commit and remote-state evidence.

---

## 37. Current Validation Decision

Based on the executed evidence:

```text
Framework Status:        Completed
Framework Version:       1.0.0
Historical Publication:  Published
Historical Tag:          v4.7.0-build-framework

YAML Validation:         PASS
Filesystem Validation:   PASS
Structural Validation:   PASS
Reference Validation:    PASS
Placeholder Validation:  PASS
Join Defect Validation:  PASS

Ruff:                     PASS
MyPy:                     PASS — 527 source files
Pytest:                   PASS — 1243 tests
DiffCheck:                PASS
Historical Tag:           PASS
```

Therefore:

```text
EPIC-BLD-001 REVALIDATION: PASS
```

---

## 38. Final Validation Principle

The Build Framework distinguishes historical publication from current validation evidence.

The historical release remains immutable.

The current canonical framework earns its validation state through reproducible evidence from the repository state being evaluated.

Therefore:

> A historical publication establishes provenance; current executable evidence establishes current validation.

---

**EPIC:** EPIC-BLD-001
**Framework:** Build Framework
**Framework Version:** 1.0.0
**Framework Status:** Completed
**Historical Publication:** `v4.7.0-build-framework`
**Publication Status:** Published
**Current Revalidation:** Validated
**Repository Validation:** Validated
**Final Validation Result:** PASS

---

## Dependency Reproducibility Baseline Validation

This section records revision-scoped implementation evidence separately from the historical Build Framework documentation revalidation above.

```text
Technical Revision: 113148e0db204ec48e140543f2b5dd9ab7273c87
Profile:            Python 3.13 development/CI
Resolver:           pip-tools 7.6.1
```

Executed evidence for this technical revision:

* focused dependency tests: PASS — 18 tests;
* dependency freshness check in the locked environment: PASS;
* fresh Python 3.13 environment bootstrap: PASS;
* editable installation using `--no-deps --no-build-isolation`: PASS;
* `pip check` in the repository environment: PASS;
* `pip check` in the fresh environment: PASS;
* Ruff: PASS;
* MyPy: PASS — 1141 source files;
* full Pytest: PASS — 1525 tests;
* `git diff --check`: PASS.

Validated conclusion:

```text
Dependency version-resolution reproducibility: VALIDATED
```

This result does not establish complete Build Framework implementation, CI validation, artifact reproducibility, artifact integrity, or software supply-chain assurance.

---

## Canonical CI Validation Baseline

This section records the second incremental technical implementation slice under the completed Build Framework documentation baseline.

```text
Implementation Revision: 504bd19
Corrective Revision:     c2ed8de
Workflow:                Canonical CI Validation
Remote Run:              31749853569
Remote Revision:         c2ed8de48822919fa69b670911ecd01a909b0732
Remote Conclusion:       SUCCESS
```

Commit `504bd19` introduced the provider-neutral canonical runner, deterministic validation result, local CLI entry point, builtin Plugin Compliance adapter, tests, and thin GitHub Actions workflow. The first real workflow execution exposed a missing Health documentation template; commit `c2ed8de` corrected that repository defect before the successful evidence run.

The successful remote workflow:

* checked out a known revision;
* provisioned Python 3.13;
* installed the committed locked dependency state;
* installed FamilyOS without dependency re-resolution;
* invoked the single canonical `familyos validation ci` entry point;
* uploaded structured `ci-validation.json` evidence;
* operated with repository permission `contents: read`;
* used official GitHub Actions dependencies pinned by commit SHA.

The downloaded canonical artifact records:

```text
Overall:                       PASSED
dependency-freshness:          PASSED
dependency-consistency:        PASSED
ruff:                          PASSED
mypy:                          PASSED
pytest:                        PASSED
builtin-plugin-compliance:     PASSED
Plugin Compliance Profile:     official
Discovered Builtin Plugins:    7
Compliant Builtin Plugins:     7
```

The workflow preserves mandatory validation failure as workflow failure while still attempting to upload structured evidence.

Validated conclusion:

```text
Canonical CI Validation Baseline: VALIDATED

## Local Developer Workflow Reconciliation

This documentation-only slice makes the already implemented Python 3.13
development and canonical validation workflow discoverable from the repository
root.

Repository evidence reviewed:

* `pyproject.toml` requires Python 3.13 and declares the direct dependency model;
* generated `requirements.txt` provides the controlled development/CI state;
* `scripts/check_dependency_lock.py` provides read-only freshness validation;
* `scripts/compile_dependencies.py` provides intentional regeneration;
* `familyos validation ci` provides the provider-neutral validation entry point;
* `.github/workflows/ci.yml` installs the same controlled dependency state and
  invokes that same canonical command;
* existing dependency and CI validation tests establish the behavior of these
  implementation surfaces.

The root `README.md` now records:

* Python 3.13 virtual-environment setup;
* the controlled bootstrap using `requirements.txt` followed by editable
  installation with `--no-deps --no-build-isolation`;
* `pip check` and dependency freshness behavior;
* intentional dependency regeneration;
* canonical local validation and optional deterministic JSON evidence;
* local/CI semantic alignment;
* common bootstrap and validation failures with remediation;
* safe cleanup of explicitly identified local environment and cache state;
* the explicit absence of canonical build, candidate-artifact, artifact
  validation, and build-output cleanup capabilities.

Validation conclusion:

```text
Local dependency and validation workflow: DOCUMENTED
Local/CI validation semantic alignment:   VALIDATED
Level 26 Local Developer Workflow:        PARTIAL
Build Framework Technical Implementation: IN PROGRESS
```

Level 26 remains partial because its artifact-location, artifact-related
cleanup, and CI-independent build requirements cannot be validated before
canonical artifact and CI build integration exists.

## Canonical Package Build — First Technical Slice

This revision establishes the first executable FamilyOS package-build path:

```text
familyos build
    -> CommandContext
    -> ApplicationContainer
    -> RunPackageBuildUseCase
    -> PackageBuilderPort
    -> PythonPackageBuilder
    -> sys.executable -m build --outdir <output-dir>
```

The implementation provides:

* a provider-neutral public command;
* an application-owned explicit output directory;
* a replaceable packaging port;
* a subprocess adapter with no shell interpretation;
* normalized success, failure, and execution-error results;
* non-zero CLI status for failed or erroneous packaging;
* sorted wheel and source-distribution paths as process-level outputs;
* no publication behavior;
* focused application, infrastructure, and CLI tests;
* one real isolated integration build using copied current packaging inputs.

Validation scope:

```text
Canonical package-build interface: IMPLEMENTED
Packaging mechanism:              IMPLEMENTED
Focused and integration tests:     PASS
Isolated wheel and sdist build:    PASS
Artifact validation/trust:         NOT IMPLEMENTED
CI build invocation:               NOT IMPLEMENTED
Build Framework implementation:    IN PROGRESS
```

The real integration test builds through the production adapter in a temporary
project containing the current `pyproject.toml`, `README.md`, `LICENSE`, and
`src/familyos_cli` tree. It produces one wheel and one source distribution and
asserts that all tracked checkout paths remain byte-identical.

The hygiene slice removes generated `*.egg-info/` from repository authority
and configures it, root `dist/`, and root `build/` as ignored generated state.
Setuptools may regenerate packaging metadata locally without dirtying
Git-tracked authority after hygiene commit `a85b5a7`.
`pyproject.toml` remains authoritative for package metadata, and generated
`requirements.txt` remains the controlled resolved dependency state.

Pre-commit repository-hygiene validation exercised these workflows while the
six egg-info deletions were still uncommitted:

* editable installation with `--no-deps --no-build-isolation`: PASS;
* dependency freshness: PASS;
* real `familyos build`: PASS — one wheel and one source distribution;
* canonical `familyos validation ci`: PASS;
* ignore-boundary verification: PASS — generated packaging paths ignored and
  authoritative `docs/build/`, application build, and integration-test paths
  visible.

These pre-commit runs did not by themselves prove checkout immutability after
the removals entered Git history. The dedicated post-commit evidence below
provides that proof. Neither evidence set establishes Artifact Discovery,
artifact validation, identity, integrity, trust, or Build Evidence.

### Post-Commit Source-Mutation Verification — 2026-08-14

After packaging repository hygiene commit `a85b5a7`, the following workflows
were executed against the real checkout:

* editable installation with `--no-deps --no-build-isolation`: PASS — only
  ignored packaging metadata was regenerated, and tracked status was clean;
* dependency freshness: PASS — `requirements.txt` was synchronized with
  `pyproject.toml`, generated state remained ignored, and tracked status was
  clean;
* real `familyos build`: PASS — root `dist/` contained
  `familyos_cli-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl` and
  `familyos_cli-0.1.0.tar.gz`, while tracked status remained clean;
* `familyos validation ci`: PASS — all six mandatory gates passed, all seven
  official builtin plugins were compliant, and final tracked status was clean.

Ignored `*.egg-info/`, root `dist/`, and root `build/` state is generated state,
not authoritative source. This post-commit evidence directly closes the Level
13 requirement that execution not unexpectedly mutate authoritative source.
It does not establish artifact validation, identity, integrity, trust, Build
Evidence, release readiness, or publication.

### Level 14 Artifact Discovery — 2026-08-14

The canonical package-build path now separates execution output observation
from application-owned artifact discovery:

```text
PythonPackageBuilder
    -> raw direct files created or replaced by this execution
DiscoverPackageArtifactsUseCase
    -> expected wheel and source-distribution contract
    -> classified candidate outputs
```

The current contract requires exactly one regular `.whl` and exactly one
regular `.tar.gz` file in the resolved output directory. The default directory
is `<project-root>/dist`; an explicit `--output-dir` becomes canonical for that
invocation. Missing, duplicate, out-of-location, and unexpected current outputs
produce a deterministic discovery failure and non-zero command result.
Unchanged stale files are excluded by the execution snapshot; changed or
replaced files are current outputs and are discovered normally.

Focused Ruff and MyPy validation passed. The targeted application,
infrastructure, integration, and CLI suite passed with 29 tests, including a
real isolated build through the production execution and discovery path.

Candidate classification proves only conformance to the expected current
output set. It does not establish artifact validation, identity, integrity,
trust, Build ID, Build Evidence, release handoff, or publication. Level 14
remains partial because temporary/intermediate output classification and Build
ID association remain open. At that revision, CI build invocation also
remained unimplemented.

### CI Package Build Integration — 2026-08-14

Status: REMOTELY VERIFIED.

The `Canonical CI Validation` workflow now runs `familyos build --output-dir
dist` immediately after successful validation, and uploads the resulting
`dist/` directory as the `familyos-package-candidates` artifact using the
same pinned `actions/upload-artifact` reference already used for validation
evidence. No new Python packaging or discovery logic was introduced in YAML;
the workflow invokes only the existing canonical `familyos build` command.

Static and local review confirmed:

* exactly one `familyos build` invocation; no `python -m build` in YAML;
* no wheel/sdist filename filtering or count logic in YAML;
* the package-build step carries no `continue-on-error`, so a non-zero
  `familyos build` exit (execution or discovery failure) fails the job
  directly;
* the candidate-upload step carries no `if: always()`; GitHub Actions'
  default per-step `success()` gating means it — and the build step before
  it — automatically skip when the preceding mandatory validation-failure
  step (`exit 1`) has run, so a failed validation cannot produce package
  candidates, without any reordering of the existing validation steps;
* `permissions: contents: read` is unchanged; no additional scope was added;
* local reproduction (`familyos validation ci` then
  `familyos build --output-dir dist`) was executed against this checkout and
  succeeded, matching the workflow's exact invocation.

Remote execution evidence:

* implementation commit: `63693e6152c4c8cd822313cde88e2019e5ca71a0`
  (`63693e6`);
* workflow run: `31792439104`, triggered by `push`;
* workflow status/conclusion: `completed` / `success`;
* `validate` job result: `success`;
* retained validation artifact:
  `familyos-ci-validation/ci-validation.json`;
* downloaded candidate artifact contents:
  `familyos_cli-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl` and
  `familyos_cli-0.1.0.tar.gz`;
* candidate counts: wheel `1`, source distribution `1`.

This direct evidence closes the Level 27 canonical-build and explicit
candidate-collection requirements. Candidate means discovered build output
only. No Artifact Validation occurred, no integrity digest or integrity
evidence was generated, and no identity, trust, Build ID, Build Evidence,
release-readiness, handoff, or publication semantics are established. No Level
15+ item was changed.

### Python Package Structural Validation — 2026-08-14

This implementation slice extends the canonical application sequence without
changing the GitHub Actions workflow:

```text
PythonPackageBuilder
    -> DiscoverPackageArtifactsUseCase
    -> ValidatePythonPackageArtifactsUseCase
    -> CanonicalPackageBuildResult
```

Validation consumes only the exact candidates returned by successful Artifact
Discovery. It does not rescan `dist/`. Execution failure skips discovery and
validation, discovery failure skips validation, structural `INVALID` fails the
aggregate build, and structural `VALID` permits aggregate success.

The wheel contract covers:

* a regular non-symlink candidate file;
* a readable, non-corrupt ZIP with safe and unique member paths;
* exactly one top-level package `.dist-info` directory;
* required readable `METADATA`, `WHEEL`, and `RECORD` files;
* structurally readable core/WHEEL metadata and CSV `RECORD` rows;
* coherent name/version across filename, `.dist-info`, core metadata, and the
  authoritative repository `pyproject.toml`.

The source-distribution contract covers:

* a regular non-symlink candidate file;
* a readable, non-corrupt gzip-compressed tar archive;
* safe regular members under exactly one coherent package root;
* required readable `PKG-INFO` and archived `pyproject.toml`;
* presence of Python source material;
* coherent name/version across filename, root, `PKG-INFO`, archived project
  metadata, and the authoritative repository `pyproject.toml`.

Archive members are decompressed and inspected through bounded in-memory streams
without filesystem extraction; repository paths are never materialized from
archive member names. The bounded-inspection controls allow at most 10,000
members, 64 MiB of actual content per regular member, and 512 MiB of aggregate
actual decompressed content per archive. Wheel inspection accepts stored and
deflated members; compression methods whose standard-library readers cannot
honor bounded output requests are rejected before decompression. These controls
bound this validator's structural inspection; they are not a universal hostile-
archive sandbox. `RECORD` hashes and sizes are not verified. The slice does not
install either artifact, resolve dependencies, run imports or the CLI, validate
the complete expected module/resource inventory, build from the sdist, or
generate integrity data.

Executed local evidence:

```text
Changed-file Ruff:                         PASS
Changed-file MyPy:                         PASS — 11 source files
Targeted validation/build suite:           PASS — 65 tests
Full Pytest:                               PASS — 1559 tests
Canonical repository validation:           PASS — all six gates
Real `familyos build --output-dir dist`:    PASS — structural result `VALID`
```

The immutable result's `VALID` state means structurally valid according to this
contract only. Candidate classification remains unchanged. Structural validity
does not establish Artifact Identity, Artifact Integrity, trust, provenance,
Build ID, Build Evidence, signing, attestation, release readiness, publication,
promotion, or deployment.

Level 16 remains partial, and the Level 27 `Run artifact validation` item remains
open until a later committed revision is executed successfully by the remote
GitHub Actions workflow. Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

### Remote Structural-Validation Evidence — 2026-08-14

This slice records remote evidence only. No production Python, tests, or CI
workflow definition changed.

The `Canonical CI Validation` workflow executed commit
`c49c655837f300930fa7a6b5df1714207e71e903` (short `c49c655`) on branch
`feature/bld-python-package-structural-validation`, `push` event, GitHub
Actions run `31801029251`. The run and its `validate` job both completed with
conclusion `success`.

At commit `c49c655`, the canonical `familyos build --output-dir dist`
invocation already includes the sequence:

```text
Build Execution
    -> Artifact Discovery
    -> Python Package Structural Validation
```

so this successful remote run empirically proves remote execution of the
mandatory structural-validation path, not merely build and discovery. The
`familyos-ci-validation` artifact (`ci-validation.json`) remained available,
and `familyos-package-candidates` was uploaded containing exactly
`familyos_cli-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl` and `familyos_cli-0.1.0.tar.gz` (wheel
count `1`, source-distribution count `1`).

This directly closes the Level 27 `Run artifact validation` checklist item.
The prior sentence above, stating that this item "remains open until a later
committed revision is executed successfully by the remote GitHub Actions
workflow," is superseded by this run.

The run again emitted the previously recorded GitHub Actions Node.js 20
deprecation warning. That maintenance debt is unchanged and already recorded;
it does not affect this run's `success` conclusion or the validation evidence
above.

This evidence establishes only that the currently implemented structural
validation executed successfully in CI. It does NOT establish:

* isolated wheel installation;
* import smoke or CLI smoke validation;
* source-distribution functional build/install validation;
* Artifact Identity;
* Artifact Integrity or integrity digest generation;
* Build Evidence;
* trust, provenance, signing, release readiness, or publication.

`Generate artifact integrity data` and `Collect Build Evidence` remain open.
No Level 15 or Level 17 item changed. The remaining functional Level 16 items
remain open. Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

### Python Package Content and Metadata Validation — 2026-08-14

This implementation extends `ValidatePythonPackageArtifactsUseCase`; the
canonical sequence remains:

```text
Build Execution
    -> Artifact Discovery
    -> Python Package Validation
```

No archive is rediscovered, installed, imported, or executed. The same exact
discovered wheel and source-distribution candidates are inspected through the
existing bounded archive readers.

#### Dependency authority

PEP 440 runtime specifiers and PEP 508 dependency requirements are parsed with
the maintained `packaging` implementation. Because this functionality executes
at application runtime, `packaging>=26.0` is now an explicit project dependency;
the prior lock entry was transitive through build/test tools only. The generated
`requirements.txt` was regenerated by `scripts/compile_dependencies.py` and
passes the canonical freshness/resolution check.

#### Static metadata contract

The authoritative repository `pyproject.toml` provides package name, version,
`requires-python`, direct dependencies, and optional dependency groups. The
validator normalizes and compares that contract with:

* wheel `METADATA` `Requires-Python` and every `Requires-Dist` field;
* source-distribution `PKG-INFO` `Requires-Python` and every `Requires-Dist`
  field;
* the archived source-distribution `pyproject.toml` project metadata.

Malformed specifiers or requirements, missing/unexpected dependencies, and
metadata disagreement are deterministic `INVALID` findings. Equivalent PEP 440
version forms are compared semantically. These comparisons are package metadata
coherence only and do not create Artifact Identity.

#### Content inventory contract

Content validation separates source existence, packaging intent, and actual
candidate content. The configured setuptools package discovery and regular
package source define expected Python modules. Non-code resource intent comes
independently from `tool.setuptools.package-data`: the validator supports the
repository's exact discovered package name mapped to relative `pathlib` glob
patterns, and only regular non-symlink source files matching those patterns are
expected resources. A non-code file does not become intended merely by existing
beneath `src/familyos_cli`. Generated caches and bytecode, egg-info, editor swap
files, and common system metadata remain excluded.

The wheel must contain the exact expected package inventory outside its
`.dist-info` metadata directory. The source distribution must contain that same
inventory beneath its configured source directory. Defined project files and
backend-generated root/egg-info metadata are allowed in the source distribution;
unrelated root content is rejected. Missing modules/resources and unintended
modules/resources are reported separately and in sorted order.

The initial comparison proved that 18 builtin plugin YAML manifests and Jinja
templates were absent from both candidates. `tool.setuptools.package-data` now
makes those resources and `py.typed` explicit. The real canonical wheel and
source distribution contain exactly the independently authorized module and
resource inventories. Regression coverage also places
`plugins/builtin/security/DEBUG_LEAKED_NOTES.env` in the source tree without a
matching package-data declaration and proves that injecting it into either
candidate is an unintended-resource `INVALID` finding; no secret-content
scanning is performed.

Real `familyos build --output-dir dist`:    PASS — static package result `VALID`
```

The targeted count is produced by this exact five-file scope (including
Artifact Discovery because validation consumes its result):

```bash
python -m pytest -q \
  tests/unit/application/build/test_validate_python_package_artifacts.py \
  tests/unit/application/build/test_discover_package_artifacts.py \
  tests/unit/application/build/test_run_package_build.py \
  tests/integration/build/test_python_package_build.py \
  tests/e2e/test_cli_package_build.py
```

This slice closes the six static Level 16 runtime/dependency metadata and
content-inventory items. Clean installation, import smoke, CLI smoke, and
functional source-distribution build/install validation remain open. It does
not add Artifact Identity, Artifact Integrity, digests, Build ID, Build
Evidence, trust, provenance, signing, release readiness, publication,
promotion, or deployment. The CI workflow is unchanged; the existing canonical
command will exercise this extension after commit, while remote evidence for
the extension remains future work. Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable
historical tag `v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

### Python Package Functional Validation — 2026-08-14

#### Invocation and architecture

Wheel functional validation is explicit through:

```bash
familyos build --output-dir dist --functional-validation
```

The default build remains the fast static path, and CI is unchanged. The
opt-in sequence is:

```text
Build Execution
    -> Artifact Discovery
    -> Structural / Metadata / Content Validation
    -> Wheel Functional Validation
```

The application passes the exact discovered wheel only after static validation
succeeds. `PythonWheelFunctionalValidatorPort` is the minimal inversion boundary
for external venv, pip, Python, and console execution; the temporary-environment
implementation remains in infrastructure and orchestration tests use a
recording fake.

#### Clean-environment and dependency contract

The infrastructure adapter creates a fresh temporary venv without
`--system-site-packages`, never installs the checkout editably, and removes the
temporary tree deterministically. All pip and smoke commands use an external
working directory. The inherited `PYTHONPATH`, `PYTHONHOME`, user-base, active-
venv, and launcher variables are removed; `PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1` is set.

The repository has no committed runtime wheelhouse, so fully offline dependency
installation is not currently available without adding new dependency
infrastructure. The smallest controlled contract uses pip `--isolated`,
`--require-virtualenv`, and `--only-binary=:all:` to install the exact local
wheel. Its runtime dependency closure is selected from emitted wheel metadata
and constrained to the exact pins in committed `requirements.txt`. The shared
lock's development and build entries are not requested for installation. Pip
may use its cache or retrieve those constrained wheels; it cannot choose
unconstrained runtime versions.

#### Functional checks and failure semantics

The import target is `familyos_cli.main`, matching the canonical
`familyos = familyos_cli.main:app` project script. It is imported by the venv
Python with `-I`; the probe returns the resolved module path, which must be
inside the temporary venv and outside repository `src/`. CLI smoke invokes the
installed venv executable exactly as `familyos --help` and requires canonical
help output. No repository command or source distribution is executed; CLI
smoke is side-effect free and not network dependent. Dependency wheel retrieval
may use pip's public index when its cache is empty.

Environment/installation, import, and CLI failures produce distinct,
deterministic functional `INVALID` findings. Requested functional failure makes
the aggregate build fail. Without the explicit option, functional validation is
not executed. Structural failure always skips functional validation.

The real negative control rewrites only the console entry point of an otherwise
structurally valid FamilyOS wheel, then exercises the production adapter. Clean
installation and `familyos_cli.main` import succeed, while the installed broken
entry point is rejected at the CLI-smoke stage.

  tests/unit/infrastructure/build/test_python_package_builder.py \
  tests/integration/build/test_python_package_build.py \
  tests/e2e/test_cli_package_build.py
```

This slice closes clean-environment wheel installation, installed import smoke,
and installed CLI smoke. Functional source-distribution build/install
validation remains open. No remote execution claim is added, and no Artifact
Identity, Build ID, Artifact Integrity, digest, Build Evidence, provenance,
trust, signing, release readiness, publication, promotion, or deployment
semantics are established. Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical
tag `v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

### Python Source Distribution Rebuildability — 2026-08-14

#### Canonical construction contract

FamilyOS production infrastructure directly invokes the pypa/build frontend as:

```text
python -m build --outdir <output>
```

No `--wheel` or `--sdist` distribution flag is supplied. The documented
pypa/build default first emits the source distribution, extracts that exact
archive into temporary state, and builds the wheel from it using a separate
isolated backend environment. FamilyOS does not reimplement this two-step
frontend behavior and does not rebuild a discovered source distribution again.

Because repository build infrastructure directly invokes `python -m build`,
`build>=1.5` is now an explicit `[project.optional-dependencies].dev`
declaration. Canonical dependency compilation retained the existing resolved
`build==1.5.0` version and updated only its direct-authority annotation and
dependency-input digest.

#### Load-bearing negative control

The real integration negative control creates two isolated temporary copies of
the FamilyOS package. Both add a test-only `setup.py` construction guard that
requires `src/familyos_cli/__init__.py`, while `MANIFEST.in` excludes that file
from the source distribution. Explicit direct wheel construction from checkout
succeeds and the wheel contains the guarded file. Production
`PythonPackageBuilder` then emits the source distribution but fails non-zero
during pypa/build's wheel-from-sdist step because the guarded file is absent.
No wheel is emitted. This behavior proves that canonical execution depends on
the generated source distribution and does not silently substitute checkout
source.

The omitted module also remains a static `INVALID` finding when that emitted
negative-control archive is passed to the production static validator. The
functional regression does not weaken or bypass the existing package-content
contract.

#### Positive and validation evidence

The real canonical FamilyOS build produced and discovered exactly one source
distribution and exactly one wheel. Both passed existing static package
validation. The behavioral negative control protects the fact that this wheel
is produced through the source-distribution path. The existing opt-in command
also installed and smoke-tested the derived wheel successfully.

Real build with `--functional-validation`:              PASS — functional `VALID`
```

```bash
python -m pytest -q \

  tests/unit/infrastructure/build/test_python_package_builder.py \
  tests/integration/build/test_python_package_build.py \
  tests/e2e/test_cli_package_build.py
```

This closes the final Level 16 item with source-distribution rebuildability
semantics. It does not prove byte-for-byte reproducibility. pypa/build may still
resolve isolated backend dependencies through available caches or the network;
controlling that resolution more strongly remains separate toolchain-
determinism work. No remote execution claim, CI workflow change, Artifact
Identity, Build ID, Artifact Integrity, digest, Build Evidence, provenance,
trust, signing, release readiness, publication, promotion, or deployment
semantics are introduced. Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical
tag `v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

### Isolated Build-Backend Dependency Version Determinism — 2026-08-14

#### Canonical constraint contract

The canonical production command is now equivalent to:

```text
python -m build \
  --dependency-constraints-txt <absolute-project-root>/requirements.txt \
  --outdir <output>
```

The constraint path is resolved from the authoritative project root before the
subprocess is launched and is independent of the caller's current working
directory. No `--wheel`, `--sdist`, or `--no-isolation` option is supplied.
pypa/build therefore continues to create the source distribution in one
isolated environment and the wheel from that exact emitted archive in a second
isolated environment.

`requirements.txt` is used only with pip constraint semantics. It restricts
versions for dependencies actually requested by the backend; it neither
requests installation of every locked package nor rejects a backend dependency
solely because that package is absent from the file. Network access or a usable
cache may still be required.

#### Two-environment falsification evidence

The load-bearing integration regression creates isolated temporary project
copies and adds `packaging>=24` as a test-only build-system requirement. A
test-only setuptools probe writes the installed `packaging` version into the
existing `familyos_cli/py.typed` resource during backend execution. The copied
constraint authority deliberately pins `packaging==24.2`.

An unconstrained control builds successfully but records a resolver-selected
version other than `24.2` in both artifacts. The production builder records
`24.2` in the emitted sdist resource and again in the derived wheel resource.
Reading the artifacts directly proves that both isolated backend executions
honored the constraint without depending on human-readable pypa/build logs.
The existing construction-asymmetry regression separately continues to prove

This establishes version constraint enforcement for the current known isolated
backend dependency closure represented by `requirements.txt`. It does not
establish an allowlist, offline capability, network independence, full critical
toolchain identity, repeated-build equality, or byte-for-byte reproducibility.
Level 11 `Ensure CI installs from canonical definitions` and Level 40
`Establish critical toolchain version identity` remain open. Level 16 remains
complete. No remote execution claim, CI workflow change, Artifact Identity,
Build ID, Artifact Integrity, digest, Build Manifest, Build Evidence,
provenance, trust, signing, release readiness, publication, promotion, or
deployment semantics are introduced. Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable
historical tag `v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

### Minimal Build Context — Source Revision Capture — 2026-08-15

The canonical package-build application flow now captures an immutable
pre-build `SourceState` through `SourceStateProviderPort` before package
construction. `GitSourceStateProvider` accepts Git state only when
`git rev-parse --show-toplevel` resolves exactly to the configured project
root, preventing nested projects from inheriting an ancestor repository.

Accepted repositories capture the exact `HEAD^{commit}` and derive working-tree
dirtiness from `git status --porcelain=v1 -z --untracked-files=all`. Non-Git
roots, unavailable Git, inaccessible metadata, and rejected ancestor
repositories produce unknown source state without failing the build.

`CanonicalPackageBuildResult` preserves the same pre-build observation across
successful and failure returns. Real-Git behavioral tests cover clean, unstaged,
staged, deleted, untracked, ignored, detached/tagged, shallow, non-Git,
unavailable-Git, and ancestor-root rejection cases.

A real canonical FamilyOS build captured revision
`169b0141a28ce997aca1b765014ebf12587ebfbb`, exactly matching independently
queried `HEAD`; it captured the pre-build dirty state as `true`, succeeded with
two candidate artifacts, and left tracked checkout state unchanged.

```

Plain `pytest -q` remains independently blocked during collection by the
pre-existing top-level `scripts` import-path behavior under configured
`--import-mode=importlib`. No import-path change is included in this slice.

This closes only Level 5 source-revision capture and relevant working-tree-state
capture. The minimum Build Context model, canonical source identity, Build ID,
Artifact Identity, Artifact Integrity, Build Manifest, Build Evidence,
provenance, and release-candidate source policy remain open or out of scope.
Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

### Minimal Build Identity — 2026-08-15

Canonical package-build execution now receives an opaque, provider-neutral
Build ID. `BuildId` is an immutable UUID-backed application value object and
`BuildIdGenerator` generates UUID version 4 identifiers by default while
allowing deterministic UUID factories in tests.

`RunPackageBuildUseCase` generates exactly one Build ID at the beginning of
each canonical execution, before source-state observation and package
construction. The same identifier is propagated through
`CanonicalPackageBuildResult` on successful and failed execution paths.

Local development builds receive Build IDs under the same canonical semantics
as CI and release-candidate executions. The identifier is independent of Git
revision and CI-provider run identity. Two canonical executions from the same
checkout therefore remain independently identifiable.

The CLI exposes the identifier as:

```text
Build ID: <canonical UUID>
```

Real canonical builds emitted UUID version 4 identifiers, and separate
executions emitted distinct identifiers. A real build with functional
validation completed successfully while preserving the same execution-level
identity through the canonical result.

git diff --check:                                       PASS
```

The canonical full-suite invocation is `python -m pytest -q`. Direct invocation
through the `pytest` executable continues to expose the pre-existing top-level
`scripts` namespace import-path behavior; no import-path change is included in
this slice.

This revision establishes minimal Build ID semantics, generation for canonical
local/CI/release-candidate build execution, diagnostic exposure, canonical UUID
format, and generation/propagation tests. It does not yet associate Build ID
with a complete Build Context, Artifact Identity, structured validation
results, or Build Evidence. Artifact Manifest, Artifact Integrity, provenance,
signing, publication, promotion, and deployment semantics remain open or out
of scope.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

### Minimal Artifact Identity — 2026-08-16

Canonical package-build execution now constructs explicit Artifact Identity
metadata for structurally valid candidate artifacts.

Structural validation exposes a validated `PackageIdentity` containing the
authoritative package logical name and version only when candidate metadata
satisfies the project package contract. Identity construction therefore reuses
validated package metadata rather than independently reparsing or deriving
package identity from artifact filenames.

`BuildArtifactIdentitiesUseCase` combines each successful candidate with the
canonical execution context to produce immutable `ArtifactIdentity` metadata
containing:

```text
logical_name
artifact_type
version
source_revision
build_id
path
size
```

Artifact type is represented by the shared ArtifactClass model. Discovery
remains identity-neutral: DiscoveredArtifact continues to represent only the
discovered path, semantic artifact class, and discovery classification.

A real canonical build produced exactly two Artifact Identity records: one
Python wheel and one source distribution. Both carried package name
familyos-cli, version 0.1.0, the canonical Build ID, the pre-build source
revision, their actual output paths, and filesystem sizes matching the produced
files.

A real canonical build with functional validation also preserved complete
minimal Artifact Identity metadata.

This revision closes candidate-artifact Build ID association for the implemented
Level 14 candidate model and implements the non-cryptographic Artifact Identity
portion of Level 15.

Cryptographic digest remains intentionally open. Artifact Integrity, Artifact
Manifest, Build Evidence, provenance, signing, release, publication, promotion,
and deployment semantics are not introduced by this slice.

Framework version 1.0.0 and immutable historical publication tag
v4.7.0-build-framework remain unchanged.

### Minimal Artifact Integrity — 2026-08-16

Canonical package-build execution now calculates explicit cryptographic
integrity metadata for the final bytes of structurally validated candidate
artifacts.

The implemented integrity model adopts SHA-256 as the canonical artifact digest
algorithm. `ArtifactIntegrity` associates an existing Artifact Identity with the
selected digest algorithm and its hexadecimal digest.
`ArtifactIntegrityService` calculates SHA-256 directly from the artifact file
stream and verifies current bytes against a previously recorded digest.
`BuildArtifactIntegritiesUseCase` constructs the deterministic integrity set
after successful structural validation and Artifact Identity construction.

The canonical build result exposes Artifact Integrity records on both the
static-only successful path and the opt-in functional-validation path.
Artifact Discovery remains integrity-neutral, and Artifact Identity remains
separate from cryptographic integrity metadata.

A real canonical functional build produced exactly two integrity records: one
for the Python wheel and one for the source distribution. Both SHA-256 digests
verified successfully against their final artifact bytes and remained
associated with Artifact Identities carrying the canonical Build ID and
pre-build source revision.

An independent SHA-256 calculation over the same final artifact bytes matched
the recorded digest. A copied wheel was modified by one byte while preserving
its filesystem size. Verification against the original digest failed.
Explicit recalculation over the intentionally modified copy produced a
different digest that successfully verified the new bytes.

Executed local validation:

- Targeted Artifact Integrity/build tests: PASS — 29 tests
- Global Ruff: PASS
- Global MyPy: PASS — 1195 source files

This revision closes the cryptographic-digest item of Level 15 and implements
the minimal cryptographic calculation and verification foundation of Level 17.

It does not record digests in Build Evidence, verify artifacts after transfer
between automation stages, establish a lifecycle that automatically
recalculates integrity after intentional mutation, or automatically invalidate
previous structural or functional validation state after byte modification.
Those Level 17 responsibilities remain open.

Artifact Manifest, Build Evidence, provenance, signing, release, publication,
promotion, and deployment semantics are not introduced by this slice.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

### Minimal Artifact Manifest — 2026-08-21

Canonical package-build execution now constructs an immutable structured
`ArtifactManifest` after Artifact Identity and Artifact Integrity have been
established for the structurally validated artifact set.

The manifest records the canonical Build ID and deterministic artifact entries
containing logical name, artifact type, version, size, path, digest algorithm,
digest, and structural validation state.

`BuildArtifactManifestUseCase` consumes established Artifact Integrity and
structural-validation results without recalculating artifact identity or
cryptographic digest data. Manifest completeness validation rejects duplicate
artifact paths, mismatched integrity and structural-validation artifact sets,
Build ID inconsistencies, and artifact-type inconsistencies.

A real canonical functional build produced exactly two manifest entries: one
for the Python wheel and one for the source distribution. Each manifest entry
matched its corresponding Artifact Identity and Artifact Integrity metadata,
used SHA-256 integrity data, reported structural validation state `valid`, and
referenced an existing artifact whose current filesystem size matched the
recorded manifest size.

Executed local validation:

- Manifest-generation tests: PASS — 9 tests
- Related Artifact Identity/Integrity/build tests: PASS — 24 tests
- Global Ruff: PASS
- Global MyPy: PASS — 1198 source files

- Build ID consistency: PASS

- SHA-256 digest propagation: PASS
- Structural validation-state propagation: PASS
- Manifest completeness guards: PASS
- `git diff --check`: PASS

This revision implements the minimal application-owned Artifact Manifest
foundation of Level 18.

Association of the manifest with Build Evidence remains open. No serialized
manifest artifact, Build Evidence bundle, provenance, signing, trust,
publication, promotion, or deployment semantics are introduced by this slice.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

### Build Validation Orchestration — 2026-08-21

The Build Framework now provides an explicit application-owned Build Validation
orchestration model for canonical package-build results.

`BuildValidationProfile` defines development, validation, CI, and
release-candidate profiles. `BuildValidationRequirement` explicitly classifies
checks as required, optional, or informational. `BuildValidationStatus`
represents passed, failed, or skipped outcomes.

`BuildValidationCheckFactory` maps established canonical package-build results
into normalized checks for:

- build execution;
- artifact discovery;
- artifact structural validation;
- artifact metadata;
- artifact integrity;
- functional artifact validation.

Execution, artifact, metadata, and integrity checks are mandatory in the
current mapping. Functional artifact validation is classified according to the
caller-provided requirement.

`BuildValidationOrchestrator` produces an explicit aggregate validation
decision while preserving Build ID, validation profile, ordered checks,
diagnostics, failures, and warnings.

A failed or skipped required check blocks the aggregate validation decision.
Optional failures remain observable as warnings without failing the aggregate
decision. Informational failures are non-blocking.

Executed validation evidence:

- Ruff: PASS
- MyPy: PASS
- Build Validation tests: PASS — 15 tests
- Canonical functional build mapping: PASS
- Canonical mapped checks: PASS — 6
- Required failure decision: PASS
- Required skipped decision: PASS
- Optional failure handling: PASS
- Informational failure handling: PASS
- Build ID/profile preservation: PASS
- Validation diagnostics preservation: PASS
- `git diff --check`: PASS

A real canonical functional package build was mapped to six Build Validation
checks and produced a successful aggregate decision with every performed check
passing.

This revision implements execution, artifact, metadata, integrity, and
functional artifact validation orchestration, explicit mandatory-versus-
optional semantics, overall validation decision logic, diagnostics, and the
initial Build Validation test suite.

Input, configuration, dependency, toolchain, environment, and Build Evidence
validation remain open.

No Build Evidence ownership, release authority, provenance, signing,
publication, promotion, or deployment semantics are introduced by this slice.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

### Build Dependency Validation Integration — 2026-08-21

Build Validation now consumes the existing canonical dependency-validation
results without re-executing dependency checks or taking ownership away from
the canonical CI validation layer.

`BuildValidationCheckFactory.from_dependency_validation()` accepts established
canonical `GateResult` values for exactly:

- `dependency-freshness`;
- `dependency-consistency`.

Both gates are mapped into required `DEPENDENCY` Build Validation checks.
Canonical validation `PASSED` maps to Build Validation `PASSED`. Canonical
validation `FAILED` and `ERROR` both map to blocking Build Validation `FAILED`,
because an unsuccessful or unexecutable required dependency control cannot
establish dependency validity.

Gate diagnostics are preserved unchanged. Non-dependency gates are rejected
rather than silently accepted.

Executed validation evidence:

- dependency mapping tests: PASS;
- all Build Validation tests: PASS — 20 tests;
- dependency freshness failure mapping: PASS;
- dependency consistency failure mapping: PASS;
- dependency gate error mapping: PASS;
- unrelated-gate rejection: PASS;
- diagnostic preservation: PASS;
- real canonical dependency gate execution: PASS;
- real Build Validation dependency decision: PASS;
- `git diff --check`: PASS.

A real canonical CI validation run produced passing `dependency-freshness` and
`dependency-consistency` results. Those exact results were consumed by Build
Validation as two required dependency checks and produced an aggregate
`PASSED` decision.

This closes the current Level 19 dependency-validation item.

Input, configuration, toolchain, environment, and Build Evidence validation
remain open.

No dependency-resolution ownership is moved into Build Validation, and no new
dependency command, release authority, Build Evidence, provenance, signing,
publication, promotion, or deployment semantics are introduced.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

### Build Toolchain Validation Integration — 2026-08-21

Build Validation now includes explicit required checks for the canonical package
build toolchain.

`BuildValidationCheckFactory.from_toolchain_validation()` maps explicit
toolchain observations into two required `TOOLCHAIN` checks:

- `python-toolchain`;
- `python-build-tool`.

The Python check verifies that the active runtime satisfies the canonical
FamilyOS Python requirement. The build-tool check verifies availability of the
Python `build` module used by canonical package construction.

Focused tests cover successful toolchain mapping, incompatible Python,
unavailable build tooling, diagnostic preservation, and aggregate Build
Validation failure behavior.

A real toolchain probe confirmed:

- Python: 3.13.7;
- canonical Python requirement: satisfied;
- `python -m build`: available;
- `build` version: 1.5.0;
- `python-toolchain`: required / passed;
- `python-build-tool`: required / passed;
- aggregate Build Validation decision: PASSED;
- `git diff --check`: PASS.

This closes the current Level 19 toolchain-validation item.

Input, configuration, environment, and Build Evidence validation remain open.

Ruff, MyPy, and Pytest remain canonical quality/testing validation gates and are
not reclassified as Build Toolchain checks by this slice.

No Build Evidence, release authority, provenance, signing, publication,
promotion, or deployment semantics are introduced.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

### Build Environment Validation Integration — 2026-08-21

Build Validation now includes explicit required checks for the canonical package
build environment.

`BuildValidationCheckFactory.from_environment_validation()` maps established
environment observations into two required `ENVIRONMENT` checks:

- `project-environment`;
- `output-environment`.

The project-environment check requires the canonical project root to be
available as a directory. The output-environment check requires the configured
build-output environment to exist, be a directory, and be writable.

Focused tests cover successful environment mapping, unavailable project root,
unavailable output environment, diagnostic preservation, and aggregate Build
Validation failure behavior.

A real environment probe confirmed:

- canonical project root: available;
- canonical output directory: available;
- canonical output directory: writable;
- write/read/delete filesystem probe: PASS;
- `project-environment`: required / passed;
- `output-environment`: required / passed;
- aggregate Build Validation decision: PASSED;
- `git diff --check`: PASS.

This closes the current Level 19 environment-validation item.

Input, configuration, and Build Evidence validation remain open.

No new filesystem ownership, build execution, source-state ownership,
Build Evidence, release authority, provenance, signing, publication,
promotion, or deployment semantics are introduced.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

### Build Input Validation Integration — 2026-08-21

Build Validation now includes explicit required checks for canonical package-
build request inputs.

`BuildValidationCheckFactory.from_input_validation()` maps established request
observations into two required `INPUT` checks:

- `output-dir-input`;
- `functional-validation-input`.

The output-dir input check validates the requested build-output path as a
canonical build request input without duplicating filesystem or environment
validation. The functional-validation input check validates the canonical
boolean option controlling optional functional artifact validation.

Focused tests cover successful input mapping, invalid output-path input,
invalid functional-validation input, diagnostic preservation, and aggregate
Build Validation failure behavior.

A real input probe confirmed:

- canonical output input: `dist`;
- functional-validation input `False`: accepted;
- functional-validation input `True`: accepted;
- `output-dir-input`: required / passed;
- `functional-validation-input`: required / passed;
- aggregate Build Validation decision: PASSED;
- `git diff --check`: PASS.

This closes the current Level 19 input-validation item.

Configuration and Build Evidence validation remain open.

No filesystem ownership, environment validation, build execution, Build
Evidence, release authority, provenance, signing, publication, promotion, or
deployment semantics are introduced.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

### Build Configuration Validation Integration — 2026-08-21

Build Validation now includes explicit required checks for canonical package-
build configuration.

`BuildValidationCheckFactory.from_configuration_validation()` maps established
configuration observations into two required `CONFIGURATION` checks:

- `package-configuration`;
- `dependency-configuration`.

The package-configuration check validates the authoritative package/build
configuration from `pyproject.toml`. The dependency-configuration check
validates availability of the canonical dependency-constraint configuration
from `requirements.txt`.

Focused tests cover successful configuration mapping, invalid package
configuration, invalid dependency configuration, diagnostic preservation, and
aggregate Build Validation failure behavior.

A real configuration probe confirmed:

- project name: `familyos-cli`;
- project version: `0.1.0`;
- Python requirement: `>=3.13`;
- build backend: `setuptools.build_meta`;
- canonical `requirements.txt`: available and non-empty;
- `package-configuration`: required / passed;
- `dependency-configuration`: required / passed;
- aggregate Build Validation decision: PASSED;
- `git diff --check`: PASS.

This closes the current Level 19 configuration-validation item.

Build Evidence validation remains open.

No dependency freshness or consistency gate is re-executed by this slice.
No Build Evidence, release authority, provenance, signing, publication,
promotion, or deployment semantics are introduced.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

### Minimum Build Evidence Integration — 2026-08-21

The Build Framework now provides a concrete immutable `BuildEvidence` aggregate
and `BuildEvidenceFactory`.

The minimum evidence bundle reuses established canonical authorities without
recalculating them:

- Build ID;
- captured source state and source revision;
- Build Validation result and profile;
- artifact manifest;
- artifact integrity records and digests.

`BuildEvidence` enforces cross-authority consistency. The validation result and
artifact manifest must belong to the same Build ID as the evidence bundle.
Every artifact integrity record must belong to the same Build ID and must be
represented by an equivalent artifact manifest entry using canonical identity,
size, path, digest algorithm, and digest data.

`BuildEvidenceFactory` assembles the bundle directly from
`CanonicalPackageBuildResult` and `BuildValidationResult`. It does not generate
a new Build ID, re-read source state, recalculate digests, or rebuild the
artifact manifest.

Focused tests cover:

- preservation of canonical build authorities;
- source revision exposure;
- validation profile preservation;
- mismatched validation Build IDs;
- mismatched manifest Build IDs;
- missing source revision;
- foreign artifact-integrity Build IDs;
- integrity records not represented by the artifact manifest;
- factory preservation of package-build authorities;
- missing artifact manifests;
- mismatched factory validation Build IDs.

A real canonical package build produced coherent Build Evidence with:

- one Build ID shared across build, validation, manifest, and integrity records;
- source revision captured from the repository;
- validation profile `validation`;
- aggregate validation status `passed`;
- two artifact manifest entries;
- two SHA-256 artifact integrity records.

The minimum Level 24 evidence implementation therefore establishes:

- Build ID;
- source revision;
- profile;
- validation result;
- artifact manifest;
- artifact digests.

It also closes the existing Level 17 digest-to-Build-Evidence association and
Level 18 manifest-to-Build-Evidence association.

The following initial evidence capabilities remain open because no canonical
authority is yet established for them:

- target;
- runtime version;
- critical tool versions;
- effective configuration summary.

Mature evidence capabilities also remain open.

No provenance, signing, release authority, publication, promotion, deployment,
or reproducibility claims are introduced.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

### Build Evidence Validation Integration — 2026-08-21

Build Validation now integrates concrete canonical `BuildEvidence`.

`BuildValidationCheckFactory.from_evidence_validation()` maps Build Evidence
availability and Build ID association into one required `EVIDENCE` check named
`build-evidence`.

The evidence check behaves as follows:

- missing Build Evidence produces `FAILED`;
- Build Evidence associated with another Build ID produces `FAILED`;
- coherent Build Evidence associated with the current validation Build ID
  produces `PASSED`.

The check does not reconstruct or revalidate the internal artifact evidence.
`BuildEvidence` already enforces the consistency of Build ID, source revision,
validation result, artifact manifest, and artifact integrity records.

Focused tests cover coherent Build Evidence mapping, missing evidence,
mismatched evidence Build ID, and aggregate Build Validation failure behavior.

A real canonical package build was executed with functional artifact validation,
mapped into its base Build Validation result, converted into concrete
`BuildEvidence`, and then mapped into a required passing `EVIDENCE` check.

The resulting final validation contained seven passing required checks:

- build execution;
- artifact discovery;
- artifact structural validation;
- artifact metadata;
- artifact integrity;
- functional artifact validation;
- Build Evidence.

The final aggregate Build Validation decision was `PASSED`.

This closes the final open item in Level 19 — Build Validation Orchestration.

No release authority, publication, promotion, signing, provenance, or
deployment semantics are introduced.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

### CI Build Evidence Collection — 2026-08-22

The canonical GitHub Actions build now persists machine-readable Build
Evidence produced by the canonical FamilyOS build path.

The workflow invokes:

`familyos build --output-dir dist --evidence-output build-evidence.json`

The build command preserves established build authorities and projects them
through `BuildValidationCheckFactory`, `BuildValidationOrchestrator`,
`BuildEvidenceFactory`, and `BuildEvidenceJsonRenderer`.

The resulting `build-evidence.json` contains:

- Build ID;
- captured source revision and working-tree state;
- CI Build Validation profile and aggregate result;
- ordered Build Validation checks;
- artifact manifest;
- artifact integrity records;
- SHA-256 digests for each canonical candidate artifact.

GitHub Actions run `32574446181` completed successfully for commit
`794907e7b3b2fc5b3cdfb04da148a56bf15a0167`.

The run uploaded three distinct artifacts:

- `familyos-ci-validation`;
- `familyos-build-evidence`;
- `familyos-package-candidates`.

The downloaded Build Evidence was validated independently after the run.

Observed remote evidence:

- source revision matched the executed commit exactly;
- Build Validation profile was `ci`;
- aggregate Build Validation status was `passed`;
- six Build Validation checks were present;
- two artifact manifest entries were present;
- two artifact integrity records were present;
- both integrity records used SHA-256;
- manifest digests matched the corresponding integrity digests;
- each artifact integrity record referenced the same captured source revision.

The captured source working-tree state was `dirty: true`. This value is retained
as observed evidence and is not normalized or overridden by the Build
Framework. Clean-tree enforcement is not introduced by this CI Foundation
revision and remains a separate policy concern for stricter build profiles.

This evidence closes the remaining Level 27 items:

- Generate artifact integrity data.
- Collect Build Evidence.

Level 27 — CI Foundation is now functionally complete.

No release authority, publication, promotion, signing, provenance, or
deployment semantics are introduced.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

### Local Developer Cleanup Completion — 2026-08-22

The repository root `README.md` now documents the canonical local developer
cleanup procedure for the implemented derived state.

The documented procedure may remove:

- `.venv`;
- root `dist/`;
- root `build/`;
- generated `*.egg-info/`;
- Pytest cache directories;
- Ruff cache directories;
- MyPy cache directories.

These paths are local derived state and are reconstructable from committed
repository inputs. Root `dist/`, root `build/`, generated `*.egg-info/`, and the
listed tool caches are already classified as ignored derived state where
applicable.

The cleanup procedure explicitly avoids authoritative source, project
configuration, dependency definitions, tracked generated derivatives, and
other repository authority.

No dedicated `familyos clean` command is introduced. The documented shell
procedure is the canonical local developer cleanup path for the currently
implemented derived state.

This closes the final open item in Level 26 — Local Developer Workflow.

Level 26 is now complete at 10/10.

Broader execution failure cleanup, temporary/intermediate artifact lifecycle,
release retention, and downstream artifact handling remain owned by their
respective Build Framework implementation levels.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

### Artifact Output Classification Completion — 2026-08-22

Level 14 — Artifact Discovery now distinguishes build-output lifecycle roles
explicitly.

`ArtifactOutputClassification` defines:

- `TEMPORARY`;
- `INTERMEDIATE`;
- `CANDIDATE`.

This lifecycle classification remains independent from `ArtifactClass`, which
describes artifact/package type such as Python wheel or source distribution.

The current canonical Python package builder exposes only final direct
package-build outputs to Artifact Discovery. Under the exact canonical package
contract, the discovered wheel and source distribution are therefore classified
exclusively as `CANDIDATE`.

Temporary and intermediate roles remain explicitly representable without being
falsely inferred from outputs the current builder does not expose.

Focused tests establish that:

- all three lifecycle classifications are distinct;
- temporary output can be represented explicitly;
- intermediate output can be represented explicitly;
- canonical package discovery emits only candidate outputs.

Artifact Discovery continues to reject missing, duplicate, unexpected, and
out-of-location current outputs.

Candidate Artifact Identity and Build ID association remain downstream of
successful structural validation; discovery itself remains identity-neutral.

This closes the final two open items in Level 14 — Artifact Discovery.

Level 14 is now complete at 11/11.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

### Artifact Integrity Lifecycle Completion — 2026-08-22

Level 17 — Artifact Integrity now completes the remaining mutation lifecycle
requirements.

The application-owned `MutateArtifactUseCase` provides an explicit controlled
transition for intentional artifact byte modification.

After mutation, the use case:

- preserves the logical artifact context;
- refreshes material Artifact Identity metadata from the current bytes;
- recalculates canonical SHA-256 Artifact Integrity;
- returns only the refreshed identity and integrity state.

Previously recorded integrity does not survive byte modification. Focused tests
prove that the old digest fails against mutated bytes while the freshly
calculated integrity verifies the new bytes.

Validation state is intentionally not propagated through the mutation
transition. `MutatedArtifact` contains no structural-validation,
functional-validation, validated, or trusted state. Mutated bytes therefore
require fresh validation before downstream validated-artifact semantics can be
established again.

Artifact integrity verification after automation-stage transfer was also
validated against remotely produced CI artifacts. Downloaded wheel and source
distribution bytes matched the SHA-256 digests recorded in canonical Build
Evidence. A same-size one-byte mutation of the transferred wheel produced a
different digest and was rejected.

Focused mutation, integrity, and transfer tests cover:

- digest generation from final bytes;
- unchanged-byte verification;
- same-size and size-changing mutation detection;
- recalculation after intentional mutation;
- material identity refresh;
- invalidation of previous integrity;
- exclusion of prior validation state;
- verification after artifact transfer.

This closes the final two open items in Level 17 — Artifact Integrity.

Level 17 is now complete at 7/7.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

### Artifact Manifest Completion Reconciliation — 2026-08-22

Level 18 — Artifact Manifest is now fully reconciled with the implemented
Build Evidence model.

The canonical package build produces an immutable `ArtifactManifest` containing
the Build ID and deterministic artifact entries with logical name, artifact
type, version, size, path, digest algorithm, digest, and structural validation
state.

`BuildEvidenceFactory` requires the canonical package build result to contain
an Artifact Manifest before Build Evidence can be assembled.

The resulting immutable `BuildEvidence` aggregate directly contains the
Artifact Manifest and enforces that:

- the manifest Build ID matches the Build Evidence Build ID;
- every Artifact Integrity record belongs to the same Build ID;
- every Artifact Integrity record is represented by an equivalent manifest
  entry.

Focused manifest and Build Evidence tests validate complete manifest
construction, manifest completeness, Build ID consistency, manifest/integrity
coherence, missing-manifest rejection, and association of the established
manifest with Build Evidence.

The earlier Minimal Artifact Manifest revision correctly recorded that Build
Evidence association was not yet implemented at that historical point.
Subsequent Minimum Build Evidence integration closed that gap.

No standalone serialized manifest artifact, provenance, signing, publication,
promotion, release authority, or deployment semantics are introduced.

Level 18 — Artifact Manifest is complete at 11/11.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

### Reproducibility Baseline Validation — 2026-08-26

Level 40 reproducibility work introduced canonical wall-clock normalization at
the Python package-builder execution boundary.

`PythonPackageBuilder` now sets:

```text
SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=315532800
```

The canonical value is applied whether the caller environment omits
SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH or supplies another value.

Focused tests verify both cases.

Two consecutive canonical validation-profile builds were executed from
equivalent controlled inputs.

Observed results:

the Python wheel was byte-for-byte identical;
wheel size was identical at 481456 bytes;
wheel SHA-256 was identical at
dd817dd317062f411f564c635bb9ae8caaeda57762d3f0a602c777d761b8f42c;
wheel archive-member timestamps were identical;
the source distribution remained logically equivalent but not byte-for-byte
identical;
source-distribution variability remained confined to backend-generated
archive metadata, including temporal metadata.

A separate falsification experiment normalized all staged input mtimes and
retained the same canonical SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH. The source distribution still
contained backend-generated temporal metadata differences. This demonstrates
that the remaining sdist variability is not caused by FamilyOS input staging.

No custom archive rewriting is introduced at this maturity level.

The Level 40 acceptance target remains:

Equivalent Controlled Inputs
            ↓
Equivalent Logical Artifact

Bit-for-bit identity remains a stronger maturity target.

This evidence closes the Level 40 checklist items for removing unnecessary
time-dependent artifact influence at the current FamilyOS package-builder
boundary and comparing repeated builds.

Level 40 currently stands at 5/11.

Framework version 1.0.0 and immutable historical publication tag
v4.7.0-build-framework remain unchanged.

### Level 40 Existing-Contract Closure Validation — 2026-08-26

A focused Level 40 audit established that three reproducibility requirements
were already satisfied by existing canonical Build architecture and tests.
No new production implementation was required.

#### Deterministic Configuration Resolution

Canonical configuration resolution already has explicit behavioral coverage for:

* equivalent default and explicit development inputs;
* equivalent relative and absolute path forms;
* process-working-directory independence;
* repeated deterministic resolution;
* deterministic conflict reporting;
* immutable configuration projection;
* separation of observed environment state from configuration projection.

The focused configuration validation executed 54 tests successfully.

This evidence closes:

```text
Establish deterministic configuration resolution.
```

#### Critical Toolchain Version Identity

Canonical Build Context already captures explicit critical toolchain identities.

The existing toolchain contract provides:

* deterministic critical-version capture;
* explicit distribution and version identity;
* immutable toolchain state;
* rejection of missing or duplicate critical distributions;
* compatibility validation against canonical policy;
* exact version enforcement where required;
* deterministic incompatibility reporting;
* preservation of toolchain authority in Build Evidence.

The focused toolchain validation executed 30 tests successfully.

This evidence closes:

```text
Establish critical toolchain version identity.
```

#### Canonical Ordering

Existing Build authorities already normalize ordering where semantic ordering
is required.

Behavioral coverage establishes deterministic ordering for:

* discovered package artifacts;
* established Artifact Identities;
* Artifact Manifest artifact order;
* structural-validation content inventory diagnostics;
* candidate-specific diagnostics;
* critical toolchain versions.

The focused ordering validation executed 98 tests successfully.

This evidence closes:

```text
Normalize input ordering where relevant.
```

#### Validation Summary

```text
Configuration contract tests: 54 passed
Toolchain contract tests:     30 passed
Ordering contract tests:      98 passed
git diff --check:              PASS
Repository pre-patch state:   CLEAN
Audited HEAD:                  46d90ff
```

These closures recognize already-established behavior rather than introducing
new architecture.

Level 40 now stands at 8/11.

The remaining open requirements are:

```text
Establish canonical source identity.
Remove random artifact content where unnecessary.
Reduce uncontrolled network dependency.
```

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

### Level 40 Randomness Isolation Validation — 2026-08-26

A focused falsification established that canonical Build execution randomness
does not influence trusted package artifact content.

Two consecutive canonical validation-profile builds generated distinct Build
IDs:

```text
1f0152c0-9570-40fa-9df8-58c33737f389
678b4dfc-8b53-4582-9ce7-700b7f7e63c4
```

Build ID uniqueness therefore remained intact.

Despite the distinct execution identities:

* both builds produced the same artifact filenames;
* the Python wheel was byte-for-byte identical;
* the wheel SHA-256 was identical across both builds;
* wheel archive-member ordering was identical;
* no wheel member content differed;
* no source-distribution file content differed;
* neither Build ID appeared inside the wheel;
* neither Build ID appeared inside the source distribution.

The source-distribution archive bytes remained different only because of the
previously identified backend-generated temporal archive metadata.

Static inspection additionally confirmed that `PythonPackageBuilder` has no
`BuildId`, `uuid4`, or UUID-factory dependency.

Build ID randomness therefore remains correctly scoped to execution identity,
workspace isolation, evidence association, and related Build authorities rather
than trusted artifact content.

This evidence closes:

```text
Remove random artifact content where unnecessary.
```

Level 40 now stands at 9/11.

The remaining open requirements are:

```text
Establish canonical source identity.
Reduce uncontrolled network dependency.
```

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

### Level 40 Canonical Source Identity Validation — 2026-08-26

A focused Level 40 audit established that canonical source identity is
already provided by the existing Build architecture.

No new production implementation was required.

Canonical source identity is represented by immutable `SourceState`, which
captures:

* the exact Git source revision;
* the working-tree dirty state.

`GitSourceStateProvider` resolves the exact repository root, captures
`HEAD^{commit}`, and observes working-tree state using
`git status --porcelain=v1 -z --untracked-files=all`.

The source-state contract has explicit behavioral coverage for:

* clean repositories;
* unstaged tracked modifications;
* staged modifications;
* tracked deletions;
* untracked files;
* ignored generated outputs;
* detached HEAD;
* tagged checkouts;
* shallow repositories;
* repositories without an initial commit;
* non-Git directories;
* unavailable Git executables;
* nested projects beneath an ancestor Git repository.

The source state is captured before package construction and propagated
through canonical Build Context.

The captured source revision is subsequently associated with Artifact
Identity, while Build Evidence preserves both source revision and dirty
state.

Build Evidence requires a captured source revision, preventing evidence
from claiming authoritative source identity when that identity is absent.

Release-candidate validation additionally rejects invalid source state
before package execution.

This establishes the canonical authority chain:

```text
Git repository
      ↓
HEAD^{commit} + working-tree state
      ↓
SourceState
      ↓
BuildContext
      ↓
Package execution
      ↓
ArtifactIdentity
      ↓
BuildEvidence
```

This evidence closes:

```text
Establish canonical source identity.
```

Level 40 now stands at 10/11.

The remaining open requirement is:

```text
Reduce uncontrolled network dependency.
```

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

### Level 40 Network Dependency Closure Validation — 2026-08-26

A focused audit established that canonical Build network dependency is reduced
and controlled at the current reproducibility maturity level.

Canonical Python package construction invokes `pypa/build` with the
repository-owned absolute `requirements.txt` path through
`--dependency-constraints-txt`.

Existing integration coverage demonstrates that these constraints apply to
both isolated backend executions: source-distribution construction and wheel
construction from the emitted source distribution.

The committed dependency authority pins the critical Build toolchain:

```text
build==1.5.0
pip-tools==7.6.1
setuptools==84.0.0
wheel==0.48.0
```

Canonical CI installs committed locked dependencies before installing FamilyOS
with dependency resolution disabled.

The cache-free validation path installs the same committed dependency state
with `--no-cache-dir`, demonstrating that cache state is an optimization rather
than authoritative dependency state.

Functional wheel validation derives runtime dependencies from emitted wheel
metadata and constrains them to exact pins in committed `requirements.txt`.
Pip may retrieve constrained wheels from a cache or index when required, but
it may not choose unconstrained runtime versions.

A focused search found no arbitrary HTTP client, socket, curl, wget, git-clone,
or live external service dependency in canonical Build application or
infrastructure authorities.

Fully offline builds, prefetched dependency infrastructure, and controlled
mirrors remain stronger future maturity capabilities rather than immediate
requirements.

This evidence closes:

```text
Reduce uncontrolled network dependency.
```

It does not claim complete network independence or fully offline package
construction.

Level 40 — Reproducibility Baseline is complete at 11/11.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

### Level 41 Build Context Fingerprint Validation — 2026-08-26

Level 41 introduced canonical semantic identity for resolved Build Context.

`BuildContextFingerprinter` projects canonical Build Context authorities into a
versioned deterministic payload.

The fingerprint projection includes:

```text
source revision
source dirty state
runtime version
dependency declaration identity and SHA-256
dependency lock identity and SHA-256
critical toolchain distributions and versions
operating system
operating-system release
machine architecture
filesystem encoding
Build profile
Build target
functional-validation configuration
```

The projection intentionally excludes execution-specific or volatile identity:

```text
Build ID
package output path
Build Evidence output path
temporary directory
virtual-environment activation state
```

Critical toolchain entries are sorted before serialization.

Serialization uses deterministic JSON with sorted keys and compact separators,
UTF-8 encoding, and SHA-256.

The resulting `BuildContextFingerprint` enforces:

```text
algorithm = sha256
digest length = 64 hexadecimal characters
lowercase hexadecimal encoding
```

Focused behavioral validation confirms that:

* repeated fingerprinting of the same semantic context is deterministic;
* different Build IDs do not change the fingerprint;
* different output and Evidence paths do not change the fingerprint;
* temporary-directory changes do not change the fingerprint;
* virtual-environment activation changes do not change the fingerprint;
* dependency-state changes alter the fingerprint;
* source-revision changes alter the fingerprint;
* runtime-version changes alter the fingerprint;
* relevant environment changes alter the fingerprint;
* missing canonical source revision prevents fingerprint calculation;
* non-canonical fingerprint identities are rejected;
* equivalent fingerprints match symmetrically;
* changed canonical contexts do not match.

`BuildEvidenceFactory` calculates the fingerprint exclusively from the
already-established Build Context and does not recapture canonical authorities.

Build Evidence requires the fingerprint and deterministic JSON projects:

```json
{
  "build_context_fingerprint": {
    "algorithm": "sha256",
    "digest": "..."
  }
}
```

Focused Level 41 validation completed successfully:

```text
Build Context fingerprint tests: 16 passed
Build Evidence tests:            14 passed
Build Evidence Factory tests:     8 passed
Evidence validation checks:      57 passed
Build Evidence JSON tests:        5 passed
Build application regression:   623 passed
Build CLI/rendering regression:  47 passed
Build infrastructure regression: 30 passed
Ruff:                           PASS
MyPy:                           PASS
git diff --check:               PASS
```

Level 41 — Build Context Fingerprint is complete at 10/10.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

### Level 42 Reproducibility Testing Validation — 2026-08-26

Level 42 established canonical artifact reproducibility comparison for
equivalent FamilyOS Build Contexts.

Two canonical validation-profile package builds were executed from source
revision:

```text
3d28729718578c6933fc677b4bc2fba50ae01401
```

The executions intentionally had different Build IDs while preserving the
semantic build context.

Both executions produced the same artifact inventory:

```text
familyos_cli-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
familyos_cli-0.1.0.tar.gz
```

Canonical semantic content snapshots were introduced for regular package
archive members. Each member records canonical path, size, SHA-256 algorithm,
and SHA-256 digest.

The repeated-build comparison observed:

```text
Python wheel
raw size equal:       True
raw digest equal:     True
semantic content:     equal
metadata differences: none
classification:       bit-for-bit-equivalent

Source distribution
raw size equal:       False
raw digest equal:     False
semantic content:     equal
metadata differences: timestamp
variability:          expected
classification:       logically-equivalent

Aggregate reproducible: True
```

The wheel contained 743 semantic members in each build and the source
distribution contained 748 semantic members in each build.

Investigation of the source-distribution byte variability established that
logical member paths and contents were unchanged. Archive inspection isolated
the raw variability to timestamps. The decompressed tar byte streams therefore
differed even though semantic member content remained equivalent.

`ArtifactArchiveMetadataObserver` subsequently reproduced this finding
automatically on the real artifacts:

```text
python-wheel
differing fields: ()
metadata equal: True

source-distribution
differing fields: ('timestamp',)
metadata equal: False
```

The reproducibility model distinguishes:

* bit-for-bit equivalent artifacts;
* logically equivalent artifacts with explicitly expected variability;
* non-reproducible artifacts.

`ReproducibilityVariabilityPolicy` permits timestamp-only variability for the
current source-distribution baseline. Changed semantic content is never
classified as expected variability.

Focused Level 42 validation completed successfully:

```text
Level 42 focused tests:          67 passed
Build application regression:  687 passed
Build infrastructure:           30 passed
Build CLI / rendering:          47 passed
Ruff:                           PASS
MyPy:                           PASS
git diff --check:               PASS
```

Periodic reproducibility CI was explicitly evaluated.

The Build Framework already exercises a separate cache-free validation path
periodically. Artifact reproducibility automation remains a distinct future
capability in the CI architecture.

A new periodic reproducibility job is not justified at the current maturity
level because no canonical reproducibility runner yet owns repeated-build
orchestration, artifact pairing, comparison diagnostics, and CI result
semantics.

Scheduled reproducibility validation is therefore deferred until that
application-level authority exists. This is an explicit maturity decision and
does not weaken the Level 42 reproducibility contract established by the real
repeated-build evidence.

Level 42 — Reproducibility Testing is complete at 9/9.

Framework version 1.0.0 and immutable historical publication tag
v4.7.0-build-framework remain unchanged.

### Level 43 Supply Chain Evidence Validation — 2026-08-26

Level 43 established the current FamilyOS Supply Chain Evidence provenance
boundary.

A canonical internal `BuildProvenance` model now projects already-established
Build Evidence authorities without recapturing or reinterpreting canonical
build state.

The provenance relationship preserves:

```text
Build ID
Build Context Fingerprint
Source State
Dependency State
Toolchain State
Environment State
Artifact Integrity Records
```

`BuildProvenanceFactory` derives this representation directly from
`BuildEvidence`.

Focused validation confirmed that the factory preserves the canonical
Build Evidence objects rather than recalculating or copying independent
authorities.

Artifact provenance remains bound to the Build ID and captured source
revision, and duplicate canonical artifact types are rejected.

#### Dependency Source Evidence

Dependency-source information is recorded only to the extent currently
established by canonical Build Evidence.

`DependencyState` records the repository-controlled dependency declaration and
lock inputs through their canonical paths and cryptographic digests.

This establishes dependency-input provenance but does not claim knowledge of
the network origin from which individual distributions were resolved.

No package registry, mirror, index URL, upstream repository, download URL,
PyPI origin, or equivalent distribution-origin authority is inferred.

#### Toolchain And Environment Identity

Critical toolchain versions and canonical non-sensitive environment state are
preserved directly from Build Evidence.

The current environment authority records execution properties such as
operating system, operating-system release, machine architecture, virtual
environment state, temporary-directory identity, and filesystem encoding.

These properties describe the observed execution environment. They do not
constitute an authenticated builder identity.

#### Builder Identity

Builder identity was explicitly evaluated and intentionally deferred.

The current Build Framework does not possess a canonical authority capable of
authenticating the identity of the builder or execution worker.

Provider-specific CI runner metadata is therefore not promoted into a
canonical builder identity.

Builder identity will be reconsidered under Level 46 — Controlled Builder
Evaluation, where stronger isolation, dedicated or ephemeral workers,
environment identity, security properties, portability, and trust boundaries
can be evaluated together.

The Level 43 builder-identity checklist item therefore remains deliberately
unchecked.

#### Provenance Representation

`BuildProvenance` is an internal application model and is not a standalone
FamilyOS wire format.

The existing Build Evidence JSON representation remains unchanged and no
duplicate `"provenance"` object or proprietary provenance serializer was
introduced.

Industry-standard provenance formats were evaluated. in-toto Statement and
SLSA Provenance remain the intended future standards direction when FamilyOS
has the missing builder and attestation authorities required to produce such
claims correctly.

No SLSA statement, in-toto attestation, signing assertion, signature,
`BuilderIdentity`, `DependencySourceState`, inferred package origin, or
provider-specific runner identity is introduced by Level 43.

#### Validation Results

The final Level 43 validation completed successfully:

```text
Provenance focused tests:        12 passed
Build application regression:  704 passed
Build infrastructure:            30 passed
Build CLI / rendering:           47 passed
Ruff:                            PASS
MyPy:                            PASS
Public provenance API:           PASS
git diff --check:                PASS
```

The Level 43 checklist closes as:

```text
7 requirements satisfied
1 requirement explicitly deferred
```

The deferred requirement is:

```text
Record builder identity where appropriate
```

and is explicitly assigned to Level 46 — Controlled Builder Evaluation.

Level 43 — Supply Chain Evidence is therefore closed at the current maturity
boundary as 7/8 satisfied plus 1 explicit architectural deferral.

Framework version 1.0.0 and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

### Level 44 SBOM Evaluation Validation — 2026-08-26

Level 44 completed the architectural evaluation of Software Bill of Materials
generation without introducing premature SBOM infrastructure.

The evaluation identified operational value in runtime dependency inventory,
vulnerability analysis, software supply-chain transparency, release
composition evidence, historical investigation, and future compliance
automation.

The current canonical Build artifact scope consists of the Python wheel and
source distribution.

For artifact composition, the required dependency depth was evaluated as the
runtime dependency closure:

```text
FamilyOS package component
        ↓
direct runtime dependencies
        ↓
transitive runtime dependencies
```

Development, validation, and build-tool dependencies remain separate Build
Evidence and provenance concerns unless a future SBOM profile explicitly
extends the composition scope.

Real package metadata confirmed that the Python wheel exposes five direct
runtime requirements:

```text
packaging
typer
jinja2
pyyaml
pydantic
```

Development dependencies are emitted separately through the `dev` extra and
are not part of normal runtime composition.

The repository lock currently contains runtime, transitive, development, and
build/toolchain components together. It therefore cannot by itself be treated
as an authoritative runtime SBOM.

The current `DependencyState` establishes only the identity and SHA-256
digests of the canonical dependency declaration and lock inputs. Canonical
resolved dependency-graph identity remains a separate future maturity
capability.

SPDX and CycloneDX were both evaluated as suitable future industry-standard
SBOM representations.

Neither format was adopted as FamilyOS canonical dependency authority.

A future SBOM must be derived from established dependency authorities and must
not become the source of truth for dependency resolution.

Security Architecture integration was evaluated positively because SBOM
composition information may support dependency inventory, transitive
dependency analysis, vulnerability assessment, and release eligibility.

Release Evidence integration was also evaluated positively. A future SBOM may
form part of durable supply-chain and release evidence while remaining
complementary to Build Provenance, Artifact Integrity, release manifests, and
release validation.

Architecture governance was explicitly evaluated.

No existing ADR or RFC currently establishes a FamilyOS SBOM architecture.
Existing dependency-graph ADR material concerns other platform domains and
does not establish canonical Build dependency-graph identity.

Current Build Governance classifies changes spanning significant Build
architecture and multiple platform areas under the stronger RFC path.

A future SBOM implementation would cross Build, Security, and Release Evidence
boundaries and therefore requires an RFC or equivalent stronger governance
record before adoption.

Level 44 intentionally introduces no:

```text
SBOM generator
SPDX implementation
CycloneDX implementation
DependencyInventory authority
package-URL authority
new SBOM dependency
CI SBOM pipeline
```

Level 44 — SBOM Evaluation is complete at 8/8.

The resulting architecture decision is to defer implementation until FamilyOS
has sufficient canonical dependency-graph authority and an approved
cross-cutting governance decision.

Framework version 1.0.0 and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.


### Level 45 Artifact Signing Evaluation Validation — 2026-08-26

#### Scope

Level 45 evaluated artifact signing as a potential future supply-chain trust
control without introducing signing implementation, signing dependencies,
credentials, CI signing authority, or a proprietary signature format.

#### Validation Result

The evaluation distinguished the current artifact-integrity and provenance
authorities from cryptographic signing. Artifact SHA-256 digests provide
content-integrity evidence but do not establish signer authenticity or release
authority. Build Provenance records canonical build relationships but is not a
signed attestation.

The existing architecture assigns artifact construction, identity, integrity,
metadata, validation, and Build Evidence to Build, while downstream promotion
and release policy belong to Release. Security supplies the cryptographic and
trust requirements that a future signing architecture must satisfy.

The evaluation identified the required decision surface before adoption:

* signing objectives and target artifacts;
* trusted signing identity or authority;
* key-based versus keyless identity model;
* key, certificate, or identity protection and lifecycle;
* signature representation and storage;
* verification policy and trusted-root semantics;
* CI permissions and secret/OIDC boundaries;
* Release integration and failure behavior;
* rotation and revocation;
* cross-framework architecture governance.

No specific signing technology is adopted. Sigstore, Cosign, GPG/PGP,
key-based signing, keyless signing, certificates, OIDC identities, and
transparency-log mechanisms remain future evaluation candidates.

No `ArtifactSignature`, signer, signing service, signing key, verification key,
certificate identity, CI signing secret, OIDC `id-token` permission,
signature-verification runtime, or new signing dependency was introduced.

A future signing/trust architecture that crosses Build, Release, Security, and
CI boundaries requires architecture governance before adoption and may require
an RFC under the Build governance classification. Level 46 Controlled Builder
Evaluation may inform future builder-identity or attestation decisions, but
release signing authority is not inferred from builder identity.

#### Closure

Level 45 is complete as an architecture evaluation milestone.

**Level 45: evaluation complete.**

**Artifact Signing Adoption: Deferred by Governance.**


### Level 46 Controlled Builder Evaluation Validation — 2026-08-26

#### Scope

Level 46 evaluated stronger build isolation and controlled-builder
architecture without introducing containerized canonical builds, immutable
build images, dedicated or self-hosted build runners, remote build workers, or
authenticated builder identity.

#### Current Reproducibility Boundary

FamilyOS currently controls canonical repository and dependency inputs,
runtime and critical toolchain policy, Build Context, observed environment
state, artifact identity and integrity, Build Evidence, cache-free validation,
and artifact reproducibility comparison.

The remaining environment limitation is external host state. The framework
does not fully define or immutably control the CI host operating-system image,
provider runner-image lifecycle, preinstalled system packages, underlying host
infrastructure, or an authenticated builder identity.

#### Isolation Evaluation

Stronger isolation can reduce uncontrolled state and can provide real
reproducibility, portability, and security benefits. Candidate mechanisms
include containerized builds, immutable images, isolated or dedicated runners,
and remote build workers.

Current ephemeral CI runners already prevent reliance on previous local build
state. Combined with explicit dependency installation, virtual environments,
canonical toolchain policy, environment capture, cache-free validation, and
reproducibility testing, the current controls are proportionate to the
framework's demonstrated needs.

#### Cost And Portability Evaluation

Containerization adds image maintenance, complexity, patching, and local
developer overhead. Dedicated runners add operational lifecycle and isolation
responsibilities. Immutable images require controlled image production and
update governance. Remote workers introduce distributed infrastructure.

Any future mechanism must preserve provider independence and integrate with
canonical Build Context and Build Evidence semantics rather than defining
parallel Build behavior.

#### Security And Trust Boundary

Stronger isolation can reduce interaction with host state and limit the impact
of compromised tooling or dependencies. This is a valid future high-trust
release capability, but current evidence does not demonstrate a requirement
for the additional infrastructure.

Builder identity remains deferred. Observed environment state, GitHub runner
metadata, `ubuntu-latest`, and provider infrastructure identifiers do not
constitute authenticated `BuilderIdentity`.

#### Governance Decision

No controlled-builder implementation is adopted by Level 46. Future adoption
requires architecture governance appropriate to its scope. Containerized
canonical builds or dedicated build workers are significant environment
architecture changes; broader remote execution or trusted-builder strategy may
require RFC-level governance.

**Level 46: 7/7 evaluation complete.**

**Controlled Builder Adoption: Deferred Until Demonstrated Need.**


### Level 47 Artifact Registry Evaluation Validation — 2026-08-26

#### Scope

Level 47 evaluated whether the Build Framework currently requires a dedicated
persistent artifact registry. No registry implementation, package publication
path, registry credential, or Build-owned distribution authority was
introduced.

#### Current Storage Boundary

Canonical package candidates and canonical Build Evidence are currently
transferred through CI artifact storage. Artifact integrity is verified after
transfer, and Release Handoff consumes the validated artifacts without
rebuilding them.

This is sufficient for current CI validation and release handoff, but CI
artifact storage is not treated as a durable consumer-facing package
repository or long-term distribution architecture.

#### Registry Use Cases

A persistent registry becomes relevant when Release requires durable retention,
cross-workflow retrieval, promotion of identical validated artifacts, controlled
distribution, rollback/recovery from retained artifacts, or repository-level
retention and access policy.

The target storage relationship must preserve canonical package candidates and
their Build Evidence so that artifact identity and digests remain verifiable.

#### Retention, Permissions, And Immutability

No arbitrary retention period is introduced before a persistent repository is
selected. Future adoption must define retention classes, expiry/preservation
rules, cleanup authority, release-history requirements, and applicable
operational obligations.

Permissions must preserve the Build/Release boundary. Build owns construction,
identity, integrity, validation, evidence, and validated handoff. Release owns
promotion, publication, distribution policy, and consumer-facing channels.

Validated artifact bytes must remain immutable through promotion. A future
registry must not cause artifacts to be rebuilt between validation and
release.

#### Integrity And Existing Capabilities

Repository presence is not an integrity assertion. Canonical artifact digests
recorded in Build Evidence remain the authority for verifying transferred or
retrieved artifact bytes.

Existing package and artifact repository capabilities must be evaluated before
custom infrastructure is introduced. Concrete technology selection is deferred
until Release requirements justify persistent storage.

#### Governance Decision

No artifact registry is adopted by Level 47. Introducing a persistent
repository or materially changing release handoff/distribution architecture
requires architecture governance appropriate to its scope, potentially
including RFC-level governance for broader distribution architecture.

**Level 47: 9/9 evaluation complete.**

**Artifact Registry Adoption: Deferred Until Release Distribution Requires Persistent Artifact Storage.**

### Level 48 Remote Build Execution Evaluation Validation — 2026-08-26

Level 48 — Remote Build Execution Evaluation was completed as an architectural
and operational evaluation without introducing remote or distributed build
execution.

#### Performance Baseline

The current Build execution baseline was measured before making the adoption
decision.

Observed results:

* Build application tests: 704 passed / real 9.11s;
* Build infrastructure tests: 30 passed / real 0.90s;
* Build CLI tests: 29 passed / real 0.32s;
* Ruff Build-scope validation: PASS / real 0.04s;
* MyPy Build-scope validation: PASS / 82 source files / real 0.18s;
* recent Canonical CI Validation duration: approximately 1m24s–1m58s.

The measurements do not establish a current scalability limitation requiring
distributed Build execution.

#### Existing Execution Model

Repository inspection confirmed that remote or distributed Build execution is
not currently implemented.

No remote build worker, distributed build system, build farm, REAPI-based
execution service, Bazel remote execution architecture, BuildGrid, or
Buildbarn implementation was identified in the current Build implementation or
CI workflow.

The current local and hosted-CI execution model remains sufficient for the
demonstrated workload.

#### Cache Correctness

The current CI workflow uses dependency caching as a performance optimization.

The cache is associated with dependency state through `requirements.txt`, and
the workflow retains an independent cache-free validation path using
`--no-cache-dir`.

This existing dependency cache is not evidence of remote Build execution.

Any future remote cache or execution cache must preserve the Build Framework
cache-safety requirements, including input-aware keys, correct invalidation,
integrity, reproducibility expectations, and protection against stale or
cross-build contamination.

#### Infrastructure Complexity

Remote execution would add infrastructure that the current workload does not
justify, potentially including:

* remote workers;
* scheduling and dispatch;
* execution transport;
* worker lifecycle management;
* distributed failure handling;
* cache coordination;
* additional observability;
* infrastructure maintenance;
* stronger builder identity or trust controls.

The current evidence does not show that these costs are outweighed by an
observed engineering need.

#### Security Boundaries

Remote execution would create additional trust boundaries beyond the current
ephemeral hosted-CI model.

Future adoption must explicitly evaluate:

* worker identity and trust;
* worker isolation;
* authentication and authorization;
* source and dependency integrity;
* artifact integrity;
* secret exposure;
* cross-build contamination;
* remote cache trust;
* Build Context preservation;
* Build Evidence preservation.

Remote build services must integrate with canonical Build Context and Evidence
models and must not create a separate Build architecture.

#### Governance

Build governance explicitly identifies remote execution architecture as an
RFC-level concern.

Any adoption of remote execution therefore requires RFC-level architectural
review before implementation. Broader changes to Build Framework
responsibilities may additionally require EPIC evolution under the existing
governance model.

#### Decision

**Remote Build Execution Adoption: Deferred Until Demonstrated Scalability
Need.**

The decision is evidence-based rather than permanent. Remote execution remains
available as a future maturity capability if measurable Build scale,
performance, or operational requirements demonstrate that the existing model
is insufficient.

Level 48 — Remote Build Execution Evaluation is complete at 8/8.

### Level 49 Performance Optimization Validation — 2026-08-26

Level 49 — Performance Optimization was completed as an evidence-driven
performance evaluation. No additional optimization was introduced because the
measured Build workload does not demonstrate a bottleneck that justifies new
execution complexity.

#### Measured Baseline

Observed measurements:

* dependency installation with available pip cache: real 4.50s;
* dependency installation with `--no-cache-dir`: real 11.44s;
* canonical package build: real 2.98s;
* Build application tests: 704 passed / real 8.73s;
* Build infrastructure tests: 30 passed / real 0.84s;
* Build CLI tests: 29 passed / real 0.31s;
* combined Build validation: 763 passed / real 8.89s;
* Ruff Build-scope validation: PASS / real 0.03s;
* MyPy Build-scope validation: PASS / 82 source files / real 0.16s;
* latest observed Canonical CI Validation: approximately 1m22s;
* recent observed Canonical CI range: approximately 1m22s–1m58s.

Testing is the largest measured local validation cost. Cache-free dependency
installation is the largest measured environment-reconstruction cost. Neither
currently demonstrates a productivity or scalability problem requiring
additional Build architecture.

#### Caching Evaluation

The existing pip dependency cache has measurable value: the observed cached
installation completed in 4.50s compared with 11.44s for the cache-free
installation.

The cache remains a performance optimization rather than a correctness
dependency. Canonical CI retains a cache-free validation path, preserving the
ability to reconstruct valid dependency state without relying on cached
content.

No additional Build or artifact cache was introduced.

#### Parallel Validation Evaluation

Independent validation stages may be parallelized under the documented Build
automation contract when doing so provides material benefit and all mandatory
results remain aggregated.

The current measured workload does not justify introducing additional
parallel-execution orchestration.

#### Incremental Execution Evaluation

Repository inspection found no current incremental Build execution mechanism,
skip-unchanged Build semantics, or Build-stage cache.

Introducing incremental execution would require additional state,
invalidation, correctness, and reproducibility semantics. Current measurements
do not justify that complexity.

#### Semantic Revalidation And Re-measurement

No new optimization was adopted, so semantic revalidation after a newly
introduced optimization is not applicable.

Canonical Build semantics were nevertheless revalidated after the performance
evaluation. The combined Build-scope validation completed with 763 tests
passing.

Performance was re-measured during the evaluation. The resulting measurements
do not demonstrate a regression or a bottleneck requiring optimization.

#### Assumptions And Decision

The measurements describe the demonstrated repository workload and current
execution environment. They are not permanent performance guarantees.

Future optimization must begin with measurement, identify a material
bottleneck, evaluate risk, preserve canonical semantics, validate correctness,
and measure again.

Correctness, reliability, reproducibility, and validation remain higher
priorities than performance.

**Performance Optimization Adoption: No Additional Optimization Justified At Current Measured Scale.**

Level 49 — Performance Optimization is complete at 11/11.

### Level 50 Final Build Framework Implementation Validation — 2026-08-26

Level 50 completes the final implementation validation of EPIC-BLD-001.

#### Final Mandatory Contract

The Level 50 checklist is complete at 19/19.

The validated implementation establishes:

* canonical Build interface authority;
* explicit Build profiles;
* explicit Build Context;
* reconstructable Build environment;
* canonical dependency authority;
* explicit configuration precedence;
* observable Build execution;
* explicit candidate-artifact semantics;
* automated artifact validation;
* artifact-integrity evidence;
* canonical Build Evidence;
* canonical CI invocation;
* local/CI semantic alignment;
* enforced security boundaries;
* operational Build Governance;
* exact validated-byte Release Handoff;
* synchronized implementation documentation;
* passing implementation validation;
* no remaining critical Build Framework implementation finding.

#### Final Validation Authorities

Current evidence includes:

* full repository Pytest: 1743 passed;
* Build-focused validation: 756 passed;
* Ruff: PASS;
* MyPy: PASS across 1361 source files;
* canonical `familyos validation ci`: PASS;
* GitHub Canonical CI Validation run `33007015161`: SUCCESS;
* synchronized local and remote branch state before closure;
* clean repository state before documentation reconciliation.

The four full-suite Pytest warnings are collection warnings for application
domain classes whose names begin with `Test`; they are not test failures.

#### Historical Checklist Reconciliation

Satisfied historical mandatory requirements are reconciled as complete.

The following remain intentionally conditional or higher maturity rather than
mandatory closure blockers:

* independent official-plugin Build targets;
* documentation Build targets;
* dependency-graph identity;
* non-required potential Build metrics;
* authenticated builder identity.

#### Reproducibility Boundary

Strong reproducibility capability is validated at the governed Build Framework
scope through precise source identity, deterministic configuration,
reconstructable dependency and environment state, controlled critical
toolchain state, repeated-build comparison, and explainable variability.

Bit-for-bit reproducibility remains a separate higher-maturity target.

#### Final Decision

No additional production implementation is justified by the final audit.

**EPIC-BLD-001 Build Framework Implementation: Completed and Validated.**

Level 50 — Final Build Framework Implementation Validation is complete at
19/19.
