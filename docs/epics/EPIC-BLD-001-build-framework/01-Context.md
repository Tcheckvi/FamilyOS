# Build Framework

## 01 Context

### Overview

EPIC-BLD-001 — Build Framework establishes the context in which build engineering becomes a formal and governed capability of the FamilyOS Engineering Platform.

FamilyOS is no longer a simple collection of source files executed directly from a developer workstation.

The platform is progressively composed of:

* architectural foundations;
* engineering frameworks;
* official plugins;
* domain capabilities;
* specifications;
* generated resources;
* validation systems;
* documentation systems;
* automation;
* release processes;
* governance mechanisms.

As this ecosystem grows, the process that transforms engineering inputs into distributable technical outputs becomes a critical engineering boundary.

That process is the build.

The Build Framework exists to ensure that this boundary remains:

* explicit;
* reproducible;
* deterministic where technically feasible;
* traceable;
* observable;
* validated;
* secure;
* maintainable;
* automatable;
* governable.

The purpose of this document is to define why FamilyOS requires a dedicated Build Framework, which problems it must solve, how it relates to existing engineering foundations, and which strategic constraints guide its evolution.

---

## Background

Early-stage software projects can often rely on simple development procedures.

A developer may:

```text
Edit Source
    ↓
Run Tests
    ↓
Execute Application
```

At that stage, the distinction between development environment, build environment, validation environment, and release environment may remain relatively small.

As software architecture matures, that model becomes insufficient.

FamilyOS introduces an increasingly structured engineering ecosystem in which software must be:

* developed according to common engineering rules;
* verified through formal testing practices;
* assessed through quality controls;
* documented according to governed standards;
* packaged into technical artifacts;
* validated before promotion;
* released through controlled processes.

The build process therefore becomes an independent engineering concern.

The transition can be represented as follows:

```text
Simple Development Model

Source
  ↓
Execution
```

evolves into:

```text
FamilyOS Engineering Model

Engineering Inputs
       ↓
Testing
       ↓
Quality Controls
       ↓
Build
       ↓
Trusted Artifacts
       ↓
Release
       ↓
Distribution
```

This evolution requires build engineering to become explicit rather than implicit.

---

## Current Situation

FamilyOS already possesses many of the foundations required for disciplined build engineering.

These include:

* repository architecture;
* coding conventions;
* development workflows;
* dependency management practices;
* Python environment management;
* static analysis;
* automated testing;
* documentation standards;
* quality requirements;
* plugin architecture;
* compliance mechanisms;
* release concepts;
* technical governance.

Build-related practices also already exist throughout the repository.

Examples may include:

* Python packaging configuration;
* dependency declarations;
* virtual environments;
* package installation;
* test execution;
* Ruff validation;
* MyPy validation;
* Pytest execution;
* documentation generation;
* plugin packaging;
* generated resources;
* CI-oriented workflows;
* Git-based version identification;
* release preparation.

However, individual practices do not automatically constitute a Build Framework.

Without an explicit architecture, they risk evolving independently.

The framework therefore consolidates build-related responsibilities into a single coherent engineering model.

---

## Problem Statement

The central problem addressed by EPIC-BLD-001 is:

> How can FamilyOS reliably transform controlled engineering inputs into trusted artifacts while preserving reproducibility, traceability, validation, security, and governance?

A conventional build process might answer only:

```text
Did the build complete?
```

FamilyOS requires answers to a broader set of questions:

```text
What was built?

From which source revision?

Using which dependencies?

Using which toolchain?

Under which configuration?

Inside which environment?

Which transformations occurred?

Which validations were executed?

Which artifacts were produced?

Can those artifacts be identified?

Can their integrity be checked?

Can the build be repeated?

Can the artifact be traced back to its inputs?

Is sufficient evidence available?

Is the artifact suitable for release processing?
```

These questions define the engineering context of the Build Framework.

---

## Build Framework Motivation

The Build Framework is motivated by the need to prevent several classes of engineering instability.

---

### Uncontrolled Build Behavior

Without a common framework, different contributors or automation systems may use different build procedures.

For example:

```text
Developer A
    ↓
Build Method A

Developer B
    ↓
Build Method B

CI
    ↓
Build Method C
```

Even when all three processes appear successful, they may produce different results or apply different validation rules.

The Build Framework establishes common semantics.

---

### Hidden Environment Dependency

A build may accidentally depend on properties of the machine executing it.

Examples include:

* locally installed tools;
* local environment variables;
* operating system state;
* shell configuration;
* globally installed packages;
* implicit paths;
* user-specific configuration;
* cached dependencies;
* local filesystem content.

These dependencies reduce reproducibility.

The Build Framework requires significant build influences to become explicit wherever technically feasible.

---

### Dependency Drift

Dependencies may change independently from the FamilyOS source code.

Uncontrolled resolution can produce situations such as:

```text
Same Source Revision
        │
        ├── Dependency Set A
        │       ↓
        │   Artifact A
        │
        └── Dependency Set B
                ↓
            Artifact B
```

This weakens reproducibility and complicates debugging.

Dependency governance is therefore a fundamental build responsibility.

---

### Toolchain Drift

Build results may depend on:

* Python version;
* package manager version;
* packaging tools;
* generators;
* compilers;
* validation tools;
* platform-specific utilities.

If toolchain versions are unknown or uncontrolled, the resulting build context becomes difficult to reproduce.

The Build Framework therefore treats toolchain information as part of build context.

---

### Configuration Drift

Build behavior often depends on configuration.

Configuration may control:

* optional features;
* build profiles;
* artifact generation;
* validation behavior;
* optimization;
* packaging;
* environment behavior;
* plugin inclusion.

If configuration is implicit or uncontrolled, two apparently identical builds may behave differently.

FamilyOS therefore requires build configuration to be explicit and governable.

---

### Artifact Ambiguity

A generated file is not automatically a trusted artifact.

Without metadata and traceability, an artifact may lack answers to fundamental questions such as:

* which source produced it;
* when it was produced;
* how it was produced;
* which build profile was used;
* which dependencies were resolved;
* whether validation succeeded;
* whether it has been modified.

Artifact identity and provenance are therefore core concerns.

---

### Local and CI Divergence

A common engineering failure mode occurs when local development and CI use different build semantics.

For example:

```text
Local
  ↓
Pass

CI
  ↓
Fail
```

or worse:

```text
Local Build
      ↓
Artifact A

CI Build
      ↓
Artifact B
```

FamilyOS must reduce semantic divergence between local and automated build execution.

---

### Build and Release Coupling

Another risk is treating successful build completion as automatic release authorization.

The Build Framework deliberately separates these concerns.

```text
Build Success
    ≠
Release Approval
```

The build system establishes whether an artifact can be trusted as a build output.

The Release Framework determines whether that artifact should become an official release.

---

## Strategic Context

The Build Framework is part of a broader transition in FamilyOS engineering maturity.

The platform is progressively moving from:

```text
Implementation-Oriented Engineering
```

toward:

```text
Platform-Oriented Engineering
```

This means engineering capabilities must themselves become explicit platform components.

Examples include:

* testing as a framework;
* quality as a framework;
* documentation as a framework;
* plugin compliance as a framework;
* build as a framework;
* release as a framework.

This approach allows FamilyOS to evolve without relying on undocumented organizational knowledge.

---

## Engineering Platform Context

The Build Framework participates in the FamilyOS Engineering Platform.

Its conceptual position is:

```text
FamilyOS Engineering Platform
│
├── Engineering Foundation
├── Documentation Framework
├── Testing Framework
├── Quality Framework
├── Plugin Compliance Framework
├── Build Framework
└── Release Framework
```

These frameworks collectively govern how engineering work moves from design to distributable outputs.

---

## Engineering Flow Context

At a high level, FamilyOS engineering follows a controlled progression.

```text
Architecture
    ↓
Engineering
    ↓
Implementation
    ↓
Testing
    ↓
Quality Assessment
    ↓
Build
    ↓
Artifact Validation
    ↓
Release
```

The Build Framework does not own every stage.

Instead, it forms the transformation stage through which validated engineering state becomes explicit artifacts.

---

## Relationship With Engineering Foundation

EPIC-ENG-001 — Engineering Foundation establishes the fundamental engineering environment in which the Build Framework operates.

It provides foundational expectations concerning:

* repository organization;
* development workflow;
* code structure;
* toolchain philosophy;
* environment management;
* dependency management;
* configuration management;
* testing;
* quality;
* documentation;
* governance;
* lifecycle management.

The Build Framework specializes those concepts for build engineering.

The relationship can be represented as:

```text
Engineering Foundation
        ↓
General Engineering Rules
        ↓
Build Framework
        ↓
Build-Specific Rules
```

The Build Framework must remain consistent with the Engineering Foundation.

---

## Relationship With Testing Framework

EPIC-TST-001 — Testing Framework defines how FamilyOS verifies implementation behavior and engineering expectations.

Testing may participate in multiple stages of the build lifecycle.

Examples include:

```text
Pre-Build Tests
       ↓
Build
       ↓
Artifact Tests
       ↓
Integration Tests
```

However, responsibility remains separated.

The Testing Framework owns:

* testing architecture;
* testing levels;
* unit testing;
* integration testing;
* system testing;
* regression testing;
* fixtures;
* test isolation;
* test execution;
* test reporting.

The Build Framework owns how required test results participate in build validation and artifact trust.

---

## Relationship With Quality Framework

EPIC-QLT-001 — Quality Framework defines the broader quality model applied across FamilyOS engineering.

The Build Framework consumes quality expectations and produces evidence that can support quality assessment.

The relationship can be represented as:

```text
Quality Framework
      ↓
Quality Requirements
      ↓
Build Framework
      ↓
Build Evidence
      ↓
Quality Gates
```

The Build Framework must not duplicate the Quality Framework.

Instead, it implements build-specific quality mechanisms where necessary.

---

## Relationship With Documentation Framework

Documentation influences build engineering in two directions.

First, build processes themselves must be documented according to FamilyOS documentation standards.

Second, documentation may itself become a generated artifact.

Examples include:

* generated reference documentation;
* manifests;
* validation reports;
* metadata reports;
* API documentation;
* plugin documentation;
* release preparation documents.

The Build Framework therefore interacts with documentation both as engineering guidance and as possible build output.

---

## Relationship With Plugin Architecture

The FamilyOS plugin ecosystem introduces additional build requirements.

Official plugins may require:

* packaging;
* metadata generation;
* manifest validation;
* capability discovery;
* configuration inclusion;
* resource generation;
* compliance evidence;
* artifact creation.

The Build Framework must therefore support modular artifact production without introducing plugin-specific coupling into the core build architecture.

---

## Relationship With Plugin Compliance

The Plugin Compliance Framework establishes rules under which plugins are assessed against FamilyOS requirements.

Build processes may participate in this compliance model.

For example:

```text
Plugin Source
     ↓
Compliance Validation
     ↓
Plugin Build
     ↓
Artifact Validation
     ↓
Compliant Plugin Artifact
```

The exact integration may evolve, but build tooling must remain compatible with compliance evidence and validation requirements.

---

## Relationship With Release Framework

EPIC-REL-001 — Release Framework is the principal downstream consumer of Build Framework outputs.

The relationship is explicit:

```text
Build Framework
│
├── Artifact
├── Metadata
├── Integrity Information
├── Build Evidence
└── Validation Status
        ↓
Release Framework
```

The Release Framework may then perform:

* version confirmation;
* release approval;
* promotion;
* publication;
* distribution;
* release communication;
* release lifecycle management.

The Build Framework therefore ends where release authority begins.

---

## Relationship With Security Architecture

Build systems are security-sensitive because they participate directly in the software supply chain.

A compromised build process can potentially compromise all downstream artifacts.

Build security therefore includes concern for:

* dependencies;
* tooling;
* configuration;
* execution environment;
* secrets;
* automation permissions;
* artifact integrity;
* provenance;
* external inputs.

The Build Framework must remain aligned with FamilyOS Security Architecture and future supply-chain security requirements.

---

## Why Build Is A Separate Framework

Build engineering could theoretically remain part of the Engineering Foundation.

FamilyOS deliberately separates it because build behavior has become sufficiently complex and strategically important to require its own lifecycle, architecture, validation model, and governance.

A dedicated framework provides several advantages.

---

### Clear Ownership

Build-specific decisions can be governed independently from general development conventions.

---

### Architectural Clarity

The transformation from source to artifact becomes an explicit architecture.

---

### Stronger Reproducibility

Reproducibility becomes a first-class engineering objective rather than an incidental property.

---

### Better Traceability

Artifacts can be associated with their source, dependencies, configuration, and validation evidence.

---

### Automation Readiness

The build model can be consistently used by local workflows, CI systems, and release processes.

---

### Release Separation

Build trust and release approval remain distinct concerns.

---

### Supply Chain Foundation

The framework creates the structural basis for progressively stronger software supply-chain assurance.

---

## Build As An Engineering Capability

FamilyOS treats build engineering as a capability rather than as a command.

A command such as:

```text
python -m build
```

may execute part of a build.

But it does not define the complete build capability.

The capability includes:

```text
Build Capability
│
├── Inputs
├── Configuration
├── Dependencies
├── Toolchain
├── Environment
├── Execution
├── Validation
├── Artifact Production
├── Metadata
├── Evidence
└── Governance
```

This distinction is essential.

Commands are implementation mechanisms.

The Build Framework defines engineering semantics.

---

## Build Context Model

A build is always executed within a context.

The effective build context includes every significant element capable of influencing the output.

Conceptually:

```text
Build Context
│
├── Source Context
│   ├── Repository
│   ├── Revision
│   └── Working Tree State
│
├── Dependency Context
│   ├── Dependency Declarations
│   ├── Lock State
│   └── Resolved Versions
│
├── Toolchain Context
│   ├── Runtime
│   ├── Build Tools
│   └── Validation Tools
│
├── Configuration Context
│   ├── Build Profile
│   ├── Build Settings
│   └── Environment Overrides
│
├── Execution Context
│   ├── Operating Environment
│   ├── CI Context
│   └── Permissions
│
└── Policy Context
    ├── Quality Requirements
    ├── Security Requirements
    └── Compliance Requirements
```

The more completely this context is understood, the more explainable the resulting artifact becomes.

---

## Build Input Context

Build inputs are broader than source code.

They may include:

* application source;
* library source;
* plugin source;
* configuration;
* schemas;
* templates;
* assets;
* generated sources;
* manifests;
* dependency declarations;
* lock files;
* package metadata;
* documentation sources;
* build scripts;
* policy definitions.

A change to any significant build input may alter the result.

The Build Framework must therefore treat inputs systematically.

---

## Repository Context

FamilyOS uses the repository as the primary controlled source of engineering state.

Where practical, build-relevant definitions should be represented in version control.

This may include:

* build configuration;
* dependency declarations;
* package configuration;
* tool configuration;
* generation rules;
* validation configuration;
* CI configuration;
* artifact definitions.

This supports:

```text
Repository State
      ↓
Explainable Build State
```

Uncontrolled external state should be minimized.

---

## Environment Context

A build environment consists of the runtime conditions under which build execution occurs.

Examples include:

* operating system;
* Python version;
* installed tooling;
* dependency environment;
* filesystem state;
* environment variables;
* execution permissions;
* network availability.

FamilyOS does not require every environment to be physically identical.

It requires differences that affect build semantics to be controlled or understood.

---

## Local Development Context

Developers require build operations that are:

* accessible;
* understandable;
* reasonably fast;
* compatible with local development;
* representative of automated builds.

The framework must avoid creating a situation where only CI can reproduce the canonical build.

Local execution should remain an important engineering capability.

---

## Continuous Integration Context

CI provides a more controlled environment for standardized execution.

Build integration with CI enables:

* repeatable commands;
* controlled runtime environments;
* automated validation;
* consistent evidence;
* artifact generation;
* policy enforcement.

CI must implement the Build Framework rather than create an independent build model.

---

## Release Preparation Context

Release preparation may require stricter build controls than normal development.

Possible additional requirements include:

* clean repository state;
* controlled build profile;
* complete validation;
* artifact checksums;
* metadata generation;
* provenance information;
* immutable artifact handling.

These requirements belong to the intersection between Build and Release.

---

## Artifact Context

Artifacts are the primary outputs of the Build Framework.

Examples may include:

* Python wheels;
* source distributions;
* plugin bundles;
* generated documentation;
* schema packages;
* metadata manifests;
* validation reports;
* generated resources;
* provenance information.

Artifacts must be considered within a lifecycle.

```text
Create
  ↓
Identify
  ↓
Validate
  ↓
Record
  ↓
Store
  ↓
Handoff
```

The Build Framework governs the early stages of this lifecycle.

---

## Evidence Context

A trusted artifact requires more than artifact bytes.

FamilyOS must progressively capture evidence describing how build trust was established.

Examples include:

```text
Evidence
│
├── Source Revision
├── Build Identifier
├── Dependency State
├── Tool Versions
├── Environment Context
├── Validation Results
├── Artifact Checksums
└── Execution Logs
```

Evidence requirements may become stronger as the engineering platform matures.

---

## Reproducibility Context

Perfect bit-for-bit reproducibility may not always be immediately achievable or necessary.

FamilyOS therefore treats reproducibility as a maturity objective.

The initial objective is to make builds sufficiently controlled that equivalent engineering conditions produce predictable results.

Over time this can progress toward stronger reproducibility guarantees.

---

## Determinism Context

Determinism concerns whether identical controlled inputs produce predictable outputs.

Potential non-deterministic influences include:

* timestamps;
* random identifiers;
* unordered filesystem traversal;
* network content;
* mutable dependency repositories;
* temporary paths;
* host identifiers;
* generated metadata.

The framework requires these influences to be controlled where they materially affect trust.

---

## Traceability Context

Traceability allows FamilyOS to answer:

```text
Artifact
   ↓
Which Build?
   ↓
Which Inputs?
   ↓
Which Source?
```

This relationship is essential for:

* debugging;
* release verification;
* incident analysis;
* compliance;
* rollback investigation;
* long-term maintenance.

---

## Software Supply Chain Context

The Build Framework exists within the FamilyOS software supply chain.

```text
Source
  ↓
Dependencies
  ↓
Toolchain
  ↓
Build Environment
  ↓
Build Process
  ↓
Artifacts
  ↓
Release
  ↓
Distribution
  ↓
Runtime
```

Trust cannot be created exclusively at the final stage.

Each layer contributes to downstream confidence.

The Build Framework therefore acts as one of the central assurance boundaries in the supply chain.

---

## Governance Context

Build systems tend to accumulate complexity over time.

New:

* scripts;
* tools;
* generators;
* profiles;
* dependency mechanisms;
* CI jobs;
* packaging methods;

can gradually create fragmented build architecture.

FamilyOS governance must prevent this fragmentation.

Significant build changes therefore require appropriate architectural review.

The applicable mechanism may include:

* documentation review;
* architecture review;
* ADR;
* RFC;
* EPIC evolution;
* quality assessment.

Governance effort should remain proportional to the importance of the change.

---

## Build Complexity Risk

One of the strategic risks of build engineering is over-engineering.

A mature build platform could theoretically introduce:

* distributed build systems;
* remote execution;
* large build graphs;
* sophisticated cache infrastructure;
* dedicated artifact registries;
* advanced provenance services;
* policy engines;
* signing infrastructures.

FamilyOS must not adopt such complexity without demonstrated need.

The Build Framework therefore follows the principle:

```text
Engineering Need
      ↓
Required Capability
      ↓
Minimum Sufficient Mechanism
```

Architecture should remain scalable without forcing premature infrastructure.

---

## Simplicity Context

Simplicity is particularly important because build systems affect every contributor.

A build system that is theoretically powerful but difficult to understand may reduce engineering reliability.

FamilyOS therefore values:

* explicit commands;
* predictable stages;
* transparent configuration;
* understandable failure modes;
* minimal hidden state;
* documented behavior.

Build complexity must justify itself through clear engineering value.

---

## Maintainability Context

The Build Framework must remain maintainable across long-term platform evolution.

This requires avoiding excessive dependence on:

* individual contributors;
* undocumented local procedures;
* opaque shell behavior;
* machine-specific configuration;
* abandoned tooling;
* hidden CI logic.

Build knowledge should remain represented in:

* version-controlled configuration;
* documentation;
* automated validation;
* standard workflows.

---

## Developer Experience Context

Build engineering directly affects developer productivity.

A reliable build system should help developers understand:

* what command to run;
* what prerequisites exist;
* what stage failed;
* why it failed;
* which artifact was created;
* whether the artifact is valid.

Developer experience is therefore not separate from build quality.

Clear and predictable build behavior improves both.

---

## Automation Context

Automation is necessary for scale, but automation itself is not the objective.

The objective is controlled execution.

The progression should be:

```text
Defined Process
      ↓
Repeatable Process
      ↓
Validated Process
      ↓
Automated Process
```

Automating an undefined or inconsistent process simply reproduces inconsistency faster.

---

## Observability Context

Build failures can consume significant engineering time when diagnostic information is weak.

The framework therefore requires sufficient observability to answer:

```text
Where did the build fail?

What operation was executing?

Which input caused the failure?

Which configuration was active?

Which dependency was involved?

Which artifact was affected?

What evidence is available?
```

Observability must remain useful without exposing sensitive information.

---

## Security Context

The build process may interact with security-sensitive information such as:

* repository credentials;
* package registry credentials;
* signing material;
* API tokens;
* CI secrets;
* deployment credentials.

Build architecture must minimize unnecessary access to secrets.

Secrets should not become ordinary build inputs or artifact content.

Security-sensitive capabilities should follow least-privilege principles.

---

## Quality Context

Build quality must be evaluated through evidence rather than assumption.

A reliable build process should demonstrate:

* controlled inputs;
* valid configuration;
* valid dependencies;
* valid environment;
* successful execution;
* valid artifacts.

This creates a layered assurance model.

```text
Input Trust
    ↓
Execution Trust
    ↓
Artifact Trust
```

---

## Failure Context

Build failure is not itself undesirable.

A build system that correctly rejects invalid state is functioning as intended.

The important distinction is between:

```text
Useful Failure
```

and:

```text
Unexplained Failure
```

Useful failure:

* occurs predictably;
* identifies the failing stage;
* exposes relevant evidence;
* prevents invalid artifacts from progressing.

The framework therefore treats failure handling as part of build design.

---

## Change Context

FamilyOS will evolve.

New languages, packaging models, plugins, tooling, platforms, and distribution mechanisms may eventually appear.

The Build Framework must therefore avoid encoding assumptions that prevent evolution.

It should define stable concepts such as:

* inputs;
* environments;
* dependencies;
* toolchains;
* execution;
* artifacts;
* evidence;
* validation;

while allowing specific implementation technologies to evolve.

---

## Build Maturity Context

FamilyOS build maturity can progress incrementally.

A conceptual maturity model is:

```text
Stage 1
Manual but Documented

    ↓

Stage 2
Standardized

    ↓

Stage 3
Validated

    ↓

Stage 4
Automated

    ↓

Stage 5
Reproducible

    ↓

Stage 6
Traceable

    ↓

Stage 7
Supply-Chain Assured
```

The framework provides a stable architecture through which this progression can occur.

---

## Constraints

The Build Framework must operate within several important constraints.

### Architectural Consistency

Build architecture must remain aligned with FamilyOS architectural principles.

### Engineering Simplicity

Build infrastructure must not become more complex than necessary.

### Incremental Adoption

The framework must allow gradual implementation.

### Tool Independence

Core build concepts should not depend unnecessarily on a single tool.

### Local Usability

Developers must retain practical local build workflows.

### Automation Compatibility

The same model must support CI and future automation.

### Governance

Significant build evolution must remain controlled.

### Traceability

Trusted artifacts must progressively become more traceable.

### Security

Build processes must not weaken FamilyOS security boundaries.

---

## Assumptions

EPIC-BLD-001 currently assumes that:

* Git remains the primary source control system;
* repository state remains the primary engineering source of truth;
* Python remains a core FamilyOS implementation environment;
* local development remains important;
* CI automation will progressively increase;
* artifacts will become increasingly important as FamilyOS distribution matures;
* the Release Framework will consume trusted build outputs;
* build requirements will evolve as the platform grows.

These assumptions may be revisited through governance when the platform architecture changes.

---

## Risks

Several risks motivate continued governance of the Build Framework.

### Build Fragmentation

Multiple independent build mechanisms could emerge.

### Environment Drift

Developer and CI environments could diverge.

### Dependency Instability

Uncontrolled dependency resolution could reduce reproducibility.

### Toolchain Drift

Tool versions could silently influence build results.

### Artifact Ambiguity

Artifacts could become disconnected from source and validation evidence.

### Excessive Complexity

Build infrastructure could outgrow actual engineering needs.

### Hidden CI Logic

Critical build behavior could exist only inside automation configuration.

### Weak Release Boundary

Build completion could be confused with release authorization.

The framework is designed to reduce these risks systematically.

---

## Expected Contextual Outcome

After implementation of EPIC-BLD-001, FamilyOS should be able to move from:

```text
Developer Knowledge
       +
Repository State
       +
Local Tools
       ↓
Artifact
```

toward:

```text
Controlled Inputs
       +
Defined Configuration
       +
Governed Dependencies
       +
Known Toolchain
       +
Validated Environment
       ↓
Controlled Build Execution
       ↓
Validated Artifact
       ↓
Build Evidence
       ↓
Trusted Output
```

This transformation is the principal contextual justification for the framework.

---

## Framework Boundary

The Build Framework begins when engineering state is ready to participate in controlled artifact production.

It ends when a trusted build artifact and its associated evidence are available for downstream release processing.

```text
Engineering State
      ↓
────────────────────────────
      BUILD FRAMEWORK
────────────────────────────
      ↓
Trusted Artifact
      ↓
────────────────────────────
      RELEASE FRAMEWORK
────────────────────────────
```

This boundary is one of the core architectural separations of the FamilyOS Engineering Platform.

---

## Strategic Principle

The Build Framework exists because FamilyOS cannot rely indefinitely on the assumption that:

```text
"It builds on my machine"
```

is sufficient engineering evidence.

The target state is instead:

```text
"We know what was built,
from which inputs,
under which controlled conditions,
using which dependencies and tools,
which validations succeeded,
which artifact was produced,
and why that artifact can be trusted."
```

---

## Final Statement

EPIC-BLD-001 formalizes build engineering as a permanent capability of the FamilyOS Engineering Platform.

The framework establishes the context required to evolve from informal source-to-package operations toward a controlled artifact production system based on reproducibility, traceability, validation, evidence, automation, security, and governance.

Its purpose is not to introduce unnecessary build infrastructure.

Its purpose is to ensure that as FamilyOS grows, the transformation between source and release remains understandable, repeatable, governable, and trustworthy.

The Build Framework therefore provides the essential engineering bridge between validated FamilyOS source state and the trusted artifacts consumed by the Release Framework.
