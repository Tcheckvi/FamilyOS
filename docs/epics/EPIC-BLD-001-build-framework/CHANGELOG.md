## Changelog Policy

This changelog records significant changes to the canonical FamilyOS Build Framework.

It distinguishes between:

1. framework evolution;
2. canonical documentation changes;
3. validation-state changes;
4. historical publication;
5. post-release normalization.

Historical publication records SHALL remain immutable.

Post-release corrections SHALL be recorded separately and SHALL NOT move or recreate an existing historical release tag.

---

---

## Post-Framework Implementation — Dependency Reproducibility Baseline

Commit `113148e` established the first incremental technical implementation slice under the completed Build Framework documentation baseline.

Technical files in the implementation commit:

* `pyproject.toml`;
* `requirements.txt`;
* `scripts/compile_dependencies.py`;
* `scripts/check_dependency_lock.py`;
* `tests/unit/scripts/test_dependency_lock.py`.

The slice established canonical dependency declarations, a generated and exactly pinned Python 3.13 development/CI lock, governed pip-tools 7.6.1 resolution, canonical dependency-input digest validation, read-only freshness checking, and fresh-environment bootstrap validation.

Validation evidence:

```text
Focused Dependency Tests:  PASS — 18 tests
Dependency Freshness:       PASS
Fresh Python 3.13 Bootstrap: PASS
pip check:                  PASS
Ruff:                       PASS
MyPy:                       PASS — 1141 source files
Pytest:                     PASS — 1525 tests
git diff --check:           PASS
```

Closure state:

```text
Dependency Reproducibility Baseline: CLOSED
Build Framework Technical Implementation: IN PROGRESS
```

CI, artifact integrity and hashes, SBOM generation, provenance, vulnerability scanning, and broader reproducible-build capability remain future work. This entry does not create a new Build Framework release and does not change framework version `1.0.0` or the historical tag `v4.7.0-build-framework`.

---

## Post-Framework Implementation — Canonical CI Validation Baseline

Commit `504bd19` established the second incremental technical implementation slice after the Dependency Reproducibility Baseline.

It added:

* a provider-neutral canonical CI validation runner;
* mandatory dependency-freshness, dependency-consistency, Ruff, MyPy, Pytest, and builtin Plugin Compliance gates;
* deterministic structured `ci-validation.json` evidence;
* the local `familyos validation ci` entry point;
* a thin GitHub Actions workflow with Python 3.13 and locked dependency bootstrap;
* read-only repository permission and commit-SHA-pinned official actions;
* failure-preserving evidence upload behavior;
* focused unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.

The first real CI execution identified a missing Health documentation template. Commit `c2ed8de` corrected that defect. Remote run `31749853569` then completed successfully and uploaded a canonical artifact reporting all six gates `PASSED`, the explicit `official` compliance profile, and all seven discovered builtin plugins `COMPLIANT`.

Current implementation state:

```text
Dependency Reproducibility Baseline: CLOSED
Canonical CI Validation Baseline:    VALIDATED
Build Framework Implementation:      IN PROGRESS
```

Build execution, candidate artifacts, artifact validation, artifact integrity, full Build Evidence, release automation, and deployment remain future work. Framework version `1.0.0` and historical tag `v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

---

## Post-Framework Reconciliation — Local Developer Workflow

The repository root now documents the implemented Python 3.13 local developer
workflow. The guide establishes the discoverable controlled bootstrap,
dependency freshness and regeneration commands, canonical local validation,
optional deterministic JSON evidence, local/CI semantic equivalence, and
common failure remediation.

The reconciliation closes only the supported Level 26 documentation and
validation-alignment checklist items. Level 26 remains partial: no canonical
package-build command, candidate-artifact location, artifact-related cleanup
contract, or proof of CI-independent build execution exists yet.

This documentation-only slice does not modify dependency state, validation
semantics, CI behavior, production code, tests, framework version `1.0.0`, or
historical tag `v4.7.0-build-framework`.

---

## Post-Framework Implementation — Canonical Package Build

The first Canonical Package Build slice introduces `familyos build` as the
repository-owned public package-build contract. The command follows the
existing CLI, context, container, application-use-case, port, and
infrastructure-adapter boundaries while delegating package construction to
`sys.executable -m build` and the backend declared by `pyproject.toml`.

The slice provides explicit output-directory handling, process-level wheel and
source-distribution reporting, normalized failure propagation, non-zero CLI
failure status, focused tests, and a real package build isolated in a temporary
copy of the current packaging inputs. It contains no publication behavior.

This slice removes generated setuptools egg-info from Git authority.
`*.egg-info/`, root `dist/`, and root `build/` outputs are configured as ignored
generated state, leaving `pyproject.toml` as the package metadata authority and
`requirements.txt` as the controlled resolved dependency state. Hygiene commit
`a85b5a7` established those removals in Git history; regenerated egg-info no
longer dirties Git-tracked authority.

Post-hygiene verification after commit `a85b5a7` executed editable installation,
dependency freshness, a real checkout `familyos build`, and canonical
validation. Tracked Git status remained clean after each workflow, directly
closing the Level 13 source-mutation item. No build behavior changed in this
documentation-only reconciliation; it records evidence from already-implemented
behavior. Artifact Discovery and artifact trust maturity remain unchanged.

At that revision, artifact discovery maturity, artifact validation, identity,
integrity, Build ID, Build Evidence, CI build invocation, release handoff, and
publication remained future work. The framework remains version `1.0.0`, and
historical tag `v4.7.0-build-framework` remains unchanged.

### Level 14 Artifact Discovery — 2026-08-14

Added application-owned discovery of the current Python package output set.
The execution adapter now reports all direct files created or replaced in the
explicit output directory; the discovery use case requires exactly one wheel
and one source distribution and rejects missing, duplicate, out-of-location,
or unexpected current outputs.

Candidate classification records output-contract conformance only. Temporary
and intermediate classification, Build ID, validation, identity, integrity,
trust, Build Evidence, CI build invocation, release, and publication remain
open. Framework version `1.0.0` and historical tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` are unchanged.

### CI Package Build Integration — 2026-08-14

Status: REMOTELY VERIFIED.

The `Canonical CI Validation` workflow gained one new step invoking the
existing canonical `familyos build --output-dir dist` command after
successful validation, and one candidate-upload step publishing `dist/` as
`familyos-package-candidates` only when that build succeeds. No packaging or
discovery policy was added to YAML; a failed mandatory validation or a failed
build/discovery both prevent candidate upload without weakening existing
failure semantics.

Push run `31792439104` for commit `63693e6` completed successfully, retained
`familyos-ci-validation`, and transported exactly one wheel and one source
distribution through `familyos-package-candidates`. This documentation-only
reconciliation records remote evidence for already-committed workflow
behavior; it introduces no new build implementation. Artifact validation,
identity, integrity, trust, Build Evidence, release, and publication remain
open.

Deferred CI-maintenance debt: the run warned that the pinned
`actions/checkout`, `actions/setup-python`, and `actions/upload-artifact`
versions target Node.js 20 and were forced to Node.js 24. Action updates are
outside this evidence slice. Framework version `1.0.0` and historical tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` are unchanged.

### Python Package Structural Validation — 2026-08-14

The canonical `familyos build` application flow now validates the exact wheel
and source-distribution candidates returned by successful Artifact Discovery.
A dedicated application use case inspects ZIP and gzip-compressed tar members
through bounded decompression streams without filesystem extraction, rejects
unsafe or corrupt archive structure, requires the standard package metadata
files, and checks package name/version coherence
across filenames, archive layout, package metadata, archived project metadata,
and the authoritative repository `pyproject.toml`.

The immutable validation result distinguishes `VALID` from `INVALID` and
provides deterministic candidate-specific diagnostics. Execution or discovery
failure skips validation; structural failure fails the aggregate canonical
build and therefore returns a non-zero CLI status. The existing GitHub Actions
workflow is unchanged and will use this behavior through its existing
`familyos build --output-dir dist` invocation.

This first Level 16 slice does not install artifacts, execute imports or the
packaged CLI, validate the complete expected module/resource inventory, verify
`RECORD` hashes, generate digests, or establish Artifact Identity, Artifact
Integrity, trust, provenance, Build Evidence, release readiness, or publication.
Level 27 artifact validation remains open until a later remote workflow run
provides direct evidence. Framework version `1.0.0` and historical tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

### Remote Structural-Validation Evidence Reconciliation — 2026-08-14

This is a documentation/checklist-only reconciliation. It introduces no new
technical validation behavior; it records remote execution of the structural
validation behavior already committed in `c49c655`.

The `Canonical CI Validation` workflow executed commit `c49c655` (branch
`feature/bld-python-package-structural-validation`, `push` event) as GitHub
Actions run `31801029251`, completing with conclusion `success`. Because the
canonical `familyos build --output-dir dist` invocation at that commit already
includes Python Package Structural Validation after successful Artifact
Discovery, this run empirically proves remote execution of the mandatory
structural-validation path. `familyos-package-candidates` was uploaded
containing exactly one wheel and one source distribution, and
`familyos-ci-validation` remained available.

Level 27 `Run artifact validation` is now proven remotely and is closed.
`Generate artifact integrity data` and `Collect Build Evidence` remain open.
No Level 15 or Level 17 capability was introduced. The remaining functional
Level 16 checks (clean-environment installation, import/CLI smoke, and
source-distribution build/install validation) remain open. The previously
recorded GitHub Actions Node.js 20 deprecation warning recurred in this run;
that maintenance debt is unchanged and is not duplicated here. Framework
version `1.0.0` and historical tag `v4.7.0-build-framework` are unchanged.

### Python Package Content and Metadata Validation — 2026-08-14

The existing application-owned Python package validator now parses emitted
`Requires-Python` and `Requires-Dist` metadata using the standards-compliant
`packaging` library and compares normalized values with the authoritative
`pyproject.toml`. `packaging>=26.0` is consequently an explicit runtime
dependency rather than a silently consumed transitive build/test dependency;
the generated `requirements.txt` remains synchronized.

The validator derives its deterministic expected Python-module inventory from
configured setuptools package discovery and regular package source. Non-code
resource intent is independent: only regular source files matched by the exact
`tool.setuptools.package-data` policy are expected resources. Wheel and source-
distribution candidates fail when expected content is missing or when
unintended package content is present. This exposed and corrected packaging-
authority defects: `py.typed`, builtin plugin YAML manifests, and Jinja
templates are explicit setuptools package data and are present in both real
candidates, while an undeclared source-tree resource remains unintended if
injected into either candidate. Generated caches, bytecode, egg-info,
editor/system files, tests, and unrelated source-distribution content are not
accepted as package content merely because they appear in an archive.

This remains static package validation. It does not install either candidate,
build from the source distribution, execute imports or the CLI, verify
integrity, or establish Artifact Identity, Build ID, Build Evidence, trust,
provenance, signing, release readiness, or publication. The existing CI
workflow is unchanged; remote evidence for this increment requires a later
committed run. Framework version `1.0.0` and historical tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

### Python Package Functional Validation — 2026-08-14

The existing canonical build use case now supports explicit opt-in wheel
functional validation after successful Artifact Discovery and static package
validation. `familyos build --functional-validation` passes the exact already-
validated discovered wheel through a minimal application port to a temporary-
venv infrastructure adapter; ordinary `familyos build` and the CI workflow
remain unchanged to preserve the fast static build path.

The adapter creates a genuinely fresh venv without system site packages and
installs the wheel with pip under the exact committed `requirements.txt`
constraints. Pip follows only the wheel's runtime dependency metadata, so the
development/build portions of the shared lock are constraints rather than an
installation request. The smoke working directory is outside the checkout,
`PYTHONPATH` is removed, the import uses isolated-mode venv Python, and the
resolved `familyos_cli.main` path must belong to the temporary environment. The
installed `familyos --help` console entry point is then executed. Temporary
state is deterministically removed.

Installation, installed import, and installed CLI failures are distinct
functional `INVALID` findings and make an opted-in build fail. Real integration
evidence includes both a successful FamilyOS wheel and a structurally valid
negative-control wheel whose broken console entry point fails the CLI stage.
Source-distribution functional build/install validation remains open. No CI,
Artifact Identity, Build ID, Artifact Integrity, digest, Build Evidence,
provenance, trust, signing, release, publication, promotion, or deployment
capability is introduced. Framework version `1.0.0` and historical tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

### Python Source Distribution Rebuildability — 2026-08-14

The canonical production adapter continues to invoke pypa/build without
explicit distribution flags. That frontend behavior intentionally creates the
source distribution first and builds the wheel from that exact emitted archive;
no second rebuild, application stage, port, or CLI option is introduced.
Because repository build infrastructure invokes this behavior through
`python -m build`, `build>=1.5` is now explicit development dependency
authority rather than a transitive pip-tools dependency. The canonical compiler
regenerated `requirements.txt` without changing its resolved `build==1.5.0`
version.

A load-bearing integration negative control uses an isolated copied project,
`MANIFEST.in`, and a test-only construction guard. Direct checkout wheel
construction succeeds, while canonical execution emits the sdist and fails
when the guarded source file is absent during the wheel-from-sdist step. This
proves the frontend does not silently substitute checkout source. The real
canonical build still produces one source distribution and its derived wheel;
both pass static validation, and the existing opt-in wheel installation/import/
CLI validation succeeds for the derived wheel.

This closes the final Level 16 item with rebuildability semantics only. It does
not claim byte-for-byte reproducibility. Isolated backend dependency resolution
and network availability remain separate toolchain-determinism concerns. No CI,
Artifact Identity, Build ID, Artifact Integrity, digest, Build Evidence,
provenance, trust, signing, release, publication, promotion, or deployment
capability is introduced. Framework version `1.0.0` and historical tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

### Isolated Build-Backend Dependency Version Determinism — 2026-08-14

The production package adapter now supplies pypa/build with the absolute
repository `requirements.txt` path through
`--dependency-constraints-txt`. pypa/build applies those constraints while
installing requested dependencies into both the isolated sdist environment and
the separate isolated environment used to build the wheel from that emitted
sdist. No distribution flag or no-isolation option is added, so the existing
build-through-sdist behavior and isolation boundary remain unchanged.

An artifact-based integration regression uses temporary project copies and a
test-only backend probe that records its installed `packaging` version in an
existing package resource. An unconstrained control resolves outside the
fixture pin, while the production path records the deliberately constrained
version in both the emitted sdist and its derived wheel. The regression depends
on package artifacts rather than frontend log formatting and fails if either
isolated environment ignores the constraint authority.

Constraints restrict versions only for dependencies actually requested by the
backend; they do not install all locked packages and are not an allowlist.
Dependencies absent from the file retain normal resolver semantics, and network
or cache availability may still be required. This slice closes no checklist
item: Level 11 CI installation governance and Level 40 critical toolchain
version identity remain open, while Level 16 remains complete. It establishes
neither offline capability nor byte-for-byte reproducibility and introduces no
Artifact Identity, Build ID, Artifact Integrity, Build Manifest, Build Evidence,
provenance, signing, release, publication, promotion, or deployment semantics.
Framework version `1.0.0` and historical tag `v4.7.0-build-framework` remain
unchanged.

## Historical Publication

### Version 1.0.0

**Framework:** Build Framework
**EPIC:** EPIC-BLD-001
**Status:** Completed
**Historical Tag:** `v4.7.0-build-framework`
**Publication Status:** Published

Version `1.0.0` established the canonical FamilyOS Build Framework.

The historical tag:

```text
v4.7.0-build-framework
```

identifies the original publication state and remains immutable.

The historical tag resolves to:

```text
1b457dd86ae4c94033fa29b96b4e6db135202171
```

Post-release documentation normalization does not modify this historical reference.

---

* implementation guidance.

---

## Canonical Structure

Version `1.0.0` defines exactly:

```text
24 numbered documents
+
7 control documents
=
31 canonical files
```

Canonical numbered range:

```text
00 → 23
```

The numbered documents are:

```text
00-EPIC.md
01-Context.md
02-Vision.md
03-Build-Principles.md
04-Build-Architecture.md
05-Build-Lifecycle.md
06-Build-Input-Requirements.md

```

---

## Architecture Baseline

The Build Framework established the canonical build flow:

```text
Controlled Inputs
        ↓
Resolved Build State
        ↓
Build Execution
        ↓
Candidate Outputs
        ↓
Validation
        ↓
Trusted Artifacts
        ↓
Release Handoff
```

The architecture establishes that successful command execution alone does not make an artifact trusted.

Artifact trust depends on controlled and validated build conditions.

---

## Artifact Trust Model

The framework establishes explicit separation between:

```text
generated output
```

and:

```text
trusted artifact
```

Trusted artifacts depend on appropriate evidence including:

* controlled inputs;
* dependency resolution;
* configuration;
* environment;
* toolchain;
* execution context;
* validation;
* identity;
* integrity;
* provenance;
* reproducibility where required.

---

## Framework Boundaries

EPIC-BLD-001 defines Build Framework responsibilities without absorbing responsibilities belonging to adjacent engineering frameworks.

The Build Framework integrates with:

* Engineering Foundation;
* Testing Framework;
* Quality Framework;
* Release Framework;
* Security Framework;
* Observability Framework;
* Operations Framework.

The Build Framework produces validated build artifacts and evidence suitable for downstream release processing.

The Release Framework owns release-domain responsibilities such as:

* release planning;
* release candidates;
* promotion;
* approval;
* publication;
* distribution;
* rollback;
* release governance.

---

## Validation Model

The framework establishes evidence-based validation.

The governing principle is:

```text
Execute
    ↓
Observe
    ↓
Evaluate
    ↓
Record
```

A documented requirement is not itself evidence that the requirement passed.

Only actual validation evidence may convert an applicable validation state to PASS.

---

## Post-Release Revalidation

Following historical publication, EPIC-BLD-001 underwent canonical documentation normalization and repository revalidation.

The work preserved:

* framework identity;
* framework version `1.0.0`;
* completed framework status;
* canonical numbered range `00 → 23`;
* 24 numbered documents;
* 7 control documents;
* 31 canonical files;
* historical publication under `v4.7.0-build-framework`;
* historical tag immutability.

---

## Post-Release Normalization

### Changed

The current canonical representation was normalized to improve:

* machine-readable metadata consistency;
* canonical inventory consistency;
* validation evidence clarity;
* lifecycle-state clarity;
* framework boundary descriptions;
* historical publication separation;
* current revalidation representation;
* structural documentation consistency;
* accidental text-join defects.

---

## YAML Normalization

`EPIC.yaml` was normalized as a single valid machine-readable YAML document.

Validated identity:

```text
id: EPIC-BLD-001
version: 1.0.0
status: completed
```

Validated canonical structure:

```text
numbered_documents: 24
canonical_document_range: 00-23
control_documents: 7
canonical_files: 31
```

Validated inventory:

```text
declared: 31
actual: 31
missing: []
unexpected: []
```

Result:

```text
YAML / Filesystem Contract: PASS
```

---

## Structural Revalidation

The current canonical repository representation was checked for:

* canonical inventory;
* numbered-document integrity;
* control-document presence;
* missing files;
* unexpected files;
* empty required files;
* local Markdown references;
* canonical document references.

Validated results:

```text
Canonical Inventory:           PASS
Numbering Integrity:           PASS
Control Documents:             PASS
Filesystem Contract:           PASS
Empty File Check:              PASS
Local Markdown References:     PASS
Canonical Document References: PASS
```

---

## Placeholder Revalidation

Documentation was checked for unresolved blocking placeholder markers.

Actual result:

```text
Unresolved blocking placeholders: 0
Placeholder validation: PASS
```

Therefore:

```text
Placeholder Validation: PASS
```

---

## Join Defect Revalidation

Documentation normalization checked for accidental word joins introduced during transformations.

An identified malformed join was corrected and the subsequent executed search returned no matching defects for the configured patterns.

Result:

```text
Join Defect Validation: PASS
```

---

## Repository Quality Revalidation

The current repository state was validated using the canonical engineering quality tools.

### Ruff

Executed validation result:

```text
All checks passed!
```

Result:

```text
Ruff: PASS
```

---

### MyPy

```text
Success: no issues found in 527 source files
```

Result:

```text
MyPy: PASS — 527 source files
```

---

### Pytest

```text
1243 passed in 1.02s
```

Result:

```text
Pytest: PASS — 1243 tests
```

---

### Git Diff Validation

Executed:

```text
git diff --check
```

No errors were reported.

Result:

```text
DiffCheck: PASS
```

---

## Quality Gate Summary

Current executed quality evidence:

| Quality Gate | Result                  |
| ------------ | ----------------------- |
| Ruff         | PASS                    |
| MyPy         | PASS — 527 source files |
| Pytest       | PASS — 1243 tests       |
| Diff Check   | PASS                    |

Overall result:

```text
AUTOMATED QUALITY GATES: PASS
```

---

## Historical Tag Revalidation

The historical publication tag remains:

```text
v4.7.0-build-framework
```

Validated historical commit:

```text
1b457dd86ae4c94033fa29b96b4e6db135202171
```

The historical tag remains separate from subsequent normalization work.

Result:

```text
Historical Tag Integrity: PASS
```

---

## Revalidation Outcome

The current canonical Build Framework state satisfies the executed revalidation checks.

Current state:

```text
Framework:              Build Framework
EPIC:                   EPIC-BLD-001
Version:                1.0.0
Framework Status:       Completed
Documentation Status:   Completed
Repository Validation:  Validated
Final Validation:       Validated
Historical Publication: Published
Historical Tag:         v4.7.0-build-framework
```

Revalidation result:

```text
EPIC-BLD-001 REVALIDATION: PASS
```

---

## Historical Integrity

The post-release normalization SHALL NOT alter the historical release tag.

The following distinction is authoritative:

```text
Historical Release
        │
        └── v4.7.0-build-framework
            └── original publication state

Current Branch
        │
        └── post-release canonical normalization
            └── current validated documentation state
```

This preserves both historical provenance and current canonical correctness.

---

## Release State

The Build Framework is not awaiting its original release.

It has already been historically published.

Therefore the authoritative state is:

```text
Framework Release: Published
Historical Tag:    v4.7.0-build-framework
```

The current work represents post-release normalization and revalidation rather than a new framework release.

---

## Validation State

The current authoritative validation state is:

```text
Repository Validation: Validated
Final Validation:      Validated
```

The previous revalidation states:

```text
repository_validation_status: pending_revalidation
final_validation_status: pending_revalidation
```

may now be transitioned to:

```text
repository_validation_status: validated
final_validation_status: validated
```

because actual validation evidence has been obtained and recorded.

---

## Current Canonical State

---

## Final Changelog State

EPIC-BLD-001 version `1.0.0` remains the completed canonical FamilyOS Build Framework.

Its original publication remains represented by the immutable historical tag:

```text
v4.7.0-build-framework
```

The current canonical repository representation has undergone post-release normalization and evidence-based revalidation.

Current result:

```text
Framework Status:       COMPLETED
Historical Publication: PUBLISHED
Repository Validation:  VALIDATED
Final Validation:       VALIDATED
Revalidation Result:    PASS
```

## Minimal Build Context — Source Revision Capture — 2026-08-15

Implemented the first concrete source-state portion of Build Context. The
canonical package-build flow now captures source state exactly once before
package construction, associates it with `CanonicalPackageBuildResult`, rejects
ancestor-repository misassociation, and preserves unknown state for non-Git or
unavailable-Git conditions without failing the build.

Behavioral coverage includes real Git repositories and orchestration ordering.
Local validation passed Ruff, MyPy across 1183 source files, 123 build-slice
tests, and the controlled full suite of 1561 tests.

Level 5 source-revision capture and relevant working-tree-state capture are now
implemented. The minimum Build Context model, canonical source identity, Build
ID, Artifact Identity, Artifact Integrity, Build Evidence, provenance, and
release-candidate source policy remain open or outside this slice.

Framework version `1.0.0`, completed framework status, and immutable historical
publication tag `v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

---

## Minimal Build Identity — 2026-08-15

Implemented provider-neutral identity for canonical package-build executions.

Each canonical execution now receives one opaque UUID version 4 `BuildId`
before source-state observation and package construction. The identifier is
preserved by `CanonicalPackageBuildResult` across successful and failed paths
and is exposed by the CLI for execution correlation.

Local development builds use the same Build ID semantics as CI and
release-candidate builds. Build identity is independent of Git revision and
CI-provider run identity, so separate executions from the same source state
receive distinct identifiers.

Local validation passed Ruff, MyPy across 1186 source files, the canonical full
suite of 1561 tests, all six canonical repository validation gates, real
canonical package construction, functional validation, UUID4 format checking,
and separate-execution uniqueness checking.

Level 6 now has executable minimal Build ID semantics, generation, local-build
policy, diagnostic exposure, provider-neutral format, and generation/
propagation coverage. Build Context association, Artifact Identity association,
structured validation-result association, and Build Evidence association
remain open for subsequent slices.

Artifact Manifest, Artifact Integrity, provenance, signing, release,
publication, promotion, and deployment semantics are not introduced.

Framework version `1.0.0`, completed framework status, and immutable historical
publication tag `v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

---

## Minimal Artifact Identity — 2026-08-16

Implemented explicit identity metadata for structurally valid canonical package
artifacts.

The build application now distinguishes discovery metadata from artifact
identity. `DiscoveredArtifact` remains discovery-only, while immutable
`ArtifactIdentity` records authoritative package logical name and version,
semantic artifact type, pre-build source revision, canonical Build ID, artifact
path, and filesystem size.

Validated package name and version are exposed through `PackageIdentity` after
structural validation rather than being reparsed independently for identity
construction. `ArtifactClass` was moved to a neutral shared artifact-type
module so discovery and identity can use the same semantic type without a
dependency cycle.

Real canonical builds produced explicit identities for both the Python wheel
and source distribution, with Build ID and source revision matching the
canonical execution context and sizes matching the generated files.

Local validation passed Ruff, MyPy across 1191 source files, the canonical full
suite of 1561 tests, all six canonical repository validation gates, real
canonical package construction, functional validation, and explicit
Artifact Identity boundary probes.

Candidate-artifact Build ID association is now implemented for Level 14.
Level 15 now has executable non-cryptographic Artifact Identity semantics.
Cryptographic digest remains open for subsequent Artifact Integrity work.

Artifact Manifest, Build Evidence, provenance, signing, release, publication,
promotion, and deployment semantics are not introduced.

Framework version `1.0.0`, completed framework status, and immutable historical
publication tag `v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

---

## Minimal Artifact Integrity — 2026-08-16

Implemented minimal cryptographic integrity metadata for canonical package
artifacts.

Canonical package-build execution now calculates SHA-256 from the final bytes
of structurally validated wheel and source-distribution candidates after
Artifact Identity construction. Immutable `ArtifactIntegrity` records associate
the existing Artifact Identity with the selected algorithm and hexadecimal
digest, while `ArtifactIntegrityService` provides explicit calculation and
verification behavior.

The canonical result exposes integrity records on successful static-only and
functional-validation paths. Artifact Discovery remains integrity-neutral, and
Artifact Identity remains separate from cryptographic integrity metadata.

Local validation passed Ruff, MyPy across 1195 source files, the canonical full
suite of 1561 tests, all six canonical repository validation gates, real
functional package construction, independent SHA-256 verification, and a
same-size byte-mutation negative control.

The cryptographic-digest item of Level 15 is now implemented. Level 17 now has
an approved SHA-256 algorithm, digest calculation from final candidate bytes,
and integrity-verification tests.

Build Evidence recording, verification after automation-stage transfer,
lifecycle-enforced digest recalculation after intentional mutation, and
automatic invalidation of previous validation state after byte modification
remain open.

Artifact Manifest, Build Evidence, provenance, signing, release, publication,
promotion, and deployment semantics are not introduced.

Framework version `1.0.0`, completed framework status, and immutable historical
publication tag `v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

---

## Minimal Artifact Manifest — 2026-08-21

Implemented minimal structured Artifact Manifest metadata for canonical package
builds.

Canonical package-build execution now constructs an immutable
`ArtifactManifest` after Artifact Identity and Artifact Integrity creation. The
manifest records Build ID, artifact names, types, versions, sizes, paths,
SHA-256 digest metadata, and structural validation state.

`BuildArtifactManifestUseCase` validates completeness across the established
integrity and structural-validation artifact sets and rejects duplicate paths,
set mismatches, Build ID mismatches, and artifact-type inconsistencies.

A real canonical functional build produced a complete two-entry manifest for
the Python wheel and source distribution. Each manifest entry remained
consistent with its established Artifact Identity and Artifact Integrity
metadata.

Local validation passed nine focused manifest tests, 24 related build tests,
Ruff, MyPy across 1198 source files, the full canonical suite of 1561 tests,
all six canonical repository validation gates, and a real functional canonical
build.

Level 18 is now implemented except for association with Build Evidence, which
remains open.

No serialized manifest artifact, Build Evidence, provenance, signing, trust,
release, publication, promotion, or deployment semantics are introduced.

Framework version `1.0.0`, completed framework status, and immutable historical
publication tag `v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

---

## Build Validation Orchestration — 2026-08-21

Implemented the first explicit Build Validation orchestration layer for
canonical package-build results.

Added immutable models for validation profiles, domains, requirements, check
results, statuses, and aggregate Build Validation decisions.

Added `BuildValidationCheckFactory` to normalize established canonical build
results into execution, artifact discovery, structural validation, metadata,
integrity, and functional-artifact validation checks.

Added `BuildValidationOrchestrator` to enforce explicit decision semantics:
failed or skipped required checks block validation; optional failures are
reported without blocking the aggregate decision; informational failures remain
non-blocking.

Focused validation covers required, optional, informational, and skipped
behavior; diagnostics; profile and Build ID preservation; check ordering;
canonical result mapping; and a real functional package build producing six
passing validation checks.

Local validation passed Ruff, MyPy, 15 focused Build Validation tests, a real
canonical functional build probe, and `git diff --check`.

Level 19 remains partial. Input, configuration, dependency, toolchain,
environment, and Build Evidence validation remain open.

No Build Evidence ownership, release authority, provenance, signing,
publication, promotion, or deployment semantics are introduced.

Framework version `1.0.0`, completed framework status, and immutable historical
publication tag `v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

---

## Build Dependency Validation Integration — 2026-08-21

Integrated existing canonical dependency-validation results into Build
Validation orchestration.

`dependency-freshness` and `dependency-consistency` `GateResult` values can now
be converted into required `DEPENDENCY` Build Validation checks without
re-executing their underlying controls.

Passing canonical gates map to passing Build Validation checks. Failed or
errored canonical dependency gates map to blocking Build Validation failures.
Diagnostics are preserved, and unrelated canonical gates are rejected.

Focused tests cover successful mapping, freshness failure, consistency failure,
canonical execution error, diagnostic preservation, unrelated-gate rejection,
and aggregate decision behavior. The complete Build Validation targeted suite
passes 20 tests.

A real canonical CI validation run produced both dependency gates successfully,
and those exact results mapped to two required passing dependency checks with an
aggregate Build Validation `PASSED` decision.

Level 19 dependency validation is now implemented. Input, configuration,
toolchain, environment, and Build Evidence validation remain open.

No dependency-resolution ownership, Build Evidence, release authority,
provenance, signing, publication, promotion, or deployment semantics are
introduced.

Framework version `1.0.0`, completed framework status, and immutable historical
publication tag `v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

---

## Build Toolchain Validation Integration — 2026-08-21

Integrated explicit Build Toolchain validation into Build Validation
orchestration.

The new toolchain mapping produces required checks for the active Python
runtime and availability of the Python `build` module used by canonical package
construction.

Focused tests cover passing toolchain observations, incompatible Python,
missing build tooling, diagnostics, and aggregate decision behavior.

A real probe confirmed Python 3.13.7 and `build` 1.5.0, with both required
toolchain checks passing and an aggregate Build Validation `PASSED` decision.

Level 19 toolchain validation is now implemented. Input, configuration,
environment, and Build Evidence validation remain open.

Ruff, MyPy, and Pytest remain owned by their existing validation domains and are
not repurposed as Build Toolchain checks.

Framework version `1.0.0`, completed framework status, and immutable historical
publication tag `v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

---

## Build Environment Validation Integration — 2026-08-21

Integrated explicit Build Environment validation into Build Validation
orchestration.

The new environment mapping produces required checks for availability of the
canonical project root and usability of the build-output environment.

Focused tests cover passing environment observations, missing project root,
unavailable output environment, diagnostics, and aggregate decision behavior.

A real probe confirmed the repository project root, a writable build-output
directory, successful filesystem write/read/delete behavior, and an aggregate
Build Validation `PASSED` decision.

Level 19 environment validation is now implemented. Input, configuration, and
Build Evidence validation remain open.

No new build execution, filesystem ownership, release authority, provenance,
signing, publication, promotion, or deployment semantics are introduced.

Framework version `1.0.0`, completed framework status, and immutable historical
publication tag `v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

---

## Build Input Validation Integration — 2026-08-21

Integrated explicit Build Input validation into Build Validation orchestration.

The new input mapping produces required checks for the canonical output-path
request and functional-validation option.

Focused tests cover passing input observations, invalid output-path input,
invalid functional-validation input, diagnostics, and aggregate decision
behavior.

A real probe confirmed the canonical `dist` output input and both valid boolean
functional-validation modes, with both required input checks passing and an
aggregate Build Validation `PASSED` decision.

Level 19 input validation is now implemented. Configuration and Build Evidence
validation remain open.

No filesystem ownership, environment validation, release authority,
provenance, signing, publication, promotion, or deployment semantics are
introduced.

Framework version `1.0.0`, completed framework status, and immutable historical
publication tag `v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

---

## Build Configuration Validation Integration — 2026-08-21

Integrated explicit Build Configuration validation into Build Validation
orchestration.

The new configuration mapping produces required checks for the authoritative
package/build configuration and canonical dependency-constraint configuration.

Focused tests cover passing configuration observations, invalid package
configuration, invalid dependency configuration, diagnostics, and aggregate
decision behavior.

A real probe confirmed the canonical `pyproject.toml` metadata and build backend
plus the committed `requirements.txt`, with both required configuration checks
passing and an aggregate Build Validation `PASSED` decision.

Level 19 configuration validation is now implemented. Build Evidence validation
remains open.

No dependency gate ownership, Build Evidence, release authority, provenance,
signing, publication, promotion, or deployment semantics are introduced.

Framework version `1.0.0`, completed framework status, and immutable historical
publication tag `v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

---

## Minimum Build Evidence Integration — 2026-08-21

Added a concrete immutable `BuildEvidence` aggregate and
`BuildEvidenceFactory`.

The bundle preserves canonical Build ID, source state, Build Validation result,
artifact manifest, and artifact integrity records from an established package
build without recalculating those authorities.

Cross-authority invariants now reject mismatched Build IDs and artifact
integrity records that are not represented by the artifact manifest.

Focused tests cover the evidence model, factory construction, consistency
invariants, and failure behavior.

A real canonical package build successfully produced coherent Build Evidence
containing the same Build ID, captured source revision, validation profile and
result, two manifest entries, and two SHA-256 artifact digests.

This implementation closes six initial Level 24 evidence items plus the open
Level 17 digest association and Level 18 manifest association.

Target identity, runtime version, critical tool versions, effective
configuration summary, and mature evidence capabilities remain open.

No provenance, signing, release authority, publication, promotion, deployment,
or reproducibility semantics are introduced.

Framework version `1.0.0`, completed framework status, and immutable historical
publication tag `v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

---

## Build Evidence Validation Integration — 2026-08-21

Integrated concrete `BuildEvidence` into Build Validation.

A new required `build-evidence` check now fails when Build Evidence is missing
or belongs to another Build ID and passes when coherent Build Evidence belongs
to the current validation build.

Focused tests cover passing evidence, missing evidence, mismatched Build IDs,
and aggregate validation failure behavior.

A real canonical package build produced coherent Build Evidence and a required
passing evidence check. Combined with the existing package-build checks, the
final Build Validation decision was `PASSED`.

This implementation closes the final open checklist item in Level 19 — Build
Validation Orchestration.

No release authority, publication, promotion, signing, provenance, or
deployment semantics are introduced.

Framework version `1.0.0`, completed framework status, and immutable historical
publication tag `v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

---

## CI Build Evidence Collection — 2026-08-22

Added persistent canonical Build Evidence collection to the GitHub Actions
package-build path.

`familyos build` now supports `--evidence-output`, which writes deterministic
machine-readable Build Evidence after a successful canonical package build.

The CI workflow now invokes the canonical build with
`--evidence-output build-evidence.json` and uploads the resulting file as the
separate `familyos-build-evidence` artifact.

GitHub Actions run `32574446181` completed successfully and uploaded:

- `familyos-ci-validation`;
- `familyos-build-evidence`;
- `familyos-package-candidates`.

Downloaded remote evidence matched the executed commit, contained a passing CI
Build Validation result, two manifest entries, and two SHA-256 artifact
integrity records whose digests matched the manifest.

The observed CI source state was `dirty: true`; the evidence preserves this
observation without introducing clean-tree policy.

This closes the final two open items in Level 27 — CI Foundation.

No release authority, publication, promotion, signing, provenance, or
deployment semantics are introduced.

Framework version `1.0.0`, completed framework status, and immutable historical
publication tag `v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

---

## Local Developer Cleanup Completion — 2026-08-22

Completed the remaining Local Developer Workflow cleanup documentation.

The repository root `README.md` now documents the canonical cleanup procedure
for currently implemented derived local state, including:

- `.venv`;
- root `dist/`;
- root `build/`;
- generated `*.egg-info/`;
- Pytest caches;
- Ruff caches;
- MyPy caches.

The procedure explicitly preserves authoritative source, configuration,
dependency definitions, tracked generated derivatives, and other repository
authority.

No dedicated `familyos clean` command is introduced. The documented shell
procedure remains the canonical cleanup path for implemented local derived
state.

This closes the final open item in Level 26 — Local Developer Workflow.

Level 26 is now complete at 10/10.

Broader execution failure cleanup, temporary/intermediate artifact lifecycle,
release retention, and downstream artifact handling remain outside this local
developer workflow slice.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

---

## Artifact Output Classification Completion — 2026-08-22

Completed the remaining Artifact Discovery output-classification work.

`ArtifactOutputClassification` now distinguishes `TEMPORARY`, `INTERMEDIATE`,
and `CANDIDATE` lifecycle roles independently from artifact/package type.

The canonical Python package discovery path continues to classify only the
exact discovered wheel and source distribution as candidate artifacts. The
current builder does not expose temporary or intermediate outputs as official
discovery inputs, so those roles are represented explicitly without being
invented from unavailable observations.

Focused tests cover distinct lifecycle roles, explicit temporary/intermediate
representation, and candidate-only canonical package discovery.

This closes the final two open items in Level 14 — Artifact Discovery.

Level 14 is now complete at 11/11.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

---

## Artifact Integrity Lifecycle Completion — 2026-08-22

Completed the remaining Artifact Integrity lifecycle requirements.

Added the application-owned `MutateArtifactUseCase` for intentional artifact
byte mutation. The transition refreshes material Artifact Identity metadata and
recalculates canonical SHA-256 Artifact Integrity after the mutation.

Previously recorded integrity no longer verifies mutated bytes. The refreshed
integrity verifies the new bytes.

Mutation results deliberately carry no structural-validation,
functional-validation, validated, or trusted state, requiring fresh validation
before validated-artifact semantics can be re-established.

Artifact integrity verification after automation-stage transfer was also
validated against downloaded CI package artifacts and canonical Build Evidence.

This closes the final two open Level 17 items:

- `Recalculate digest after any intentional artifact mutation`;
- `Prevent validation state from surviving byte modification`.

Level 17 — Artifact Integrity is now complete at 7/7.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

---

## Artifact Manifest Completion Reconciliation — 2026-08-22

Reconciled Level 18 — Artifact Manifest with the implemented Build Evidence
association.

`BuildEvidenceFactory` requires an established Artifact Manifest and passes it
into the immutable `BuildEvidence` aggregate.

`BuildEvidence` enforces manifest Build ID consistency and requires every
Artifact Integrity record to be represented by the Artifact Manifest.

The historical Minimal Artifact Manifest entry remains unchanged because its
statement that Build Evidence association was still open was accurate at that
time. Subsequent Build Evidence implementation closed that gap.

No additional Artifact Manifest production code was required for this
reconciliation.

Level 18 — Artifact Manifest is complete at 11/11.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

---

## CI Permissions Security Contract Completion — 2026-08-25

Completed Level 28 — CI Permissions.

The canonical GitHub Actions Build workflow remains explicitly read-only with
`contents: read` and requires no release, publication, signing, promotion,
deployment, registry, production, or other privileged credential.

No repository secrets are referenced by the canonical workflow. Pull-request
automation uses the ordinary `pull_request` trigger rather than
`pull_request_target`, so untrusted contribution validation and package-build
execution do not inherit release credentials or privileged release authority.

A structural CI security regression test now enforces the current contract:
read-only repository permissions, absence of repository-secret references,
absence of privileged token permissions, absence of release/publication
operations, absence of `pull_request_target`, and immutable commit-SHA pinning
for external GitHub Actions.

This completion does not introduce a Release workflow, release credentials,
publication capability, signing, promotion, deployment, or new CI secrets.
Those capabilities remain outside ordinary Build execution and under downstream
Release governance when implemented.

Level 28 is complete at 9/9.

---

## CI Caching Completion — 2026-08-25

Completed Level 29 — CI Caching.

Canonical CI now uses the pip dependency cache exposed by the pinned Python
setup action. Cache identity retains the explicit Python runtime and uses
`requirements.txt` as the canonical dependency-state input through
`cache-dependency-path`.

Cache restoration does not replace authoritative dependency installation.
Canonical CI continues to install the locked dependency set from
`requirements.txt` and installs FamilyOS without dependency resolution or build
isolation. Authoritative package candidates, Build Evidence, validation
evidence, build-output directories, and local virtual environments are not
treated as dependency-cache authority.

A dedicated cache-free validation path now executes without restoring the pip
dependency cache and installs locked dependencies with `--no-cache-dir`. It
runs canonical CI validation and the canonical CI-profile package build from
cache-free dependency state.

The cache-free path is exercised periodically by a scheduled workflow trigger
and can also be invoked explicitly through `workflow_dispatch`, providing a
controlled recovery mechanism when cached state is suspected or must be
discarded.

A structural CI caching regression contract verifies safe cache selection,
runtime and dependency cache identity, cache-miss correctness, separation from
authoritative Build state, periodic cache-free execution, and explicit manual
cache-free recovery.

Level 29 — CI Caching is complete at 8/8.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

### Level 30 — Artifact Transfer Across CI Jobs

Completed canonical artifact transfer across CI jobs.

#### Added

* Added a distinct downstream `artifact-validation` CI job.
* Added canonical package-candidate transfer through
  `familyos-package-candidates`.
* Added canonical Build Evidence transfer through
  `familyos-build-evidence`.
* Added downstream SHA-256 integrity verification against canonical
  Build Evidence.
* Added rejection of missing, unexpected, and digest-mismatched
  transferred artifacts.
* Added structural and behavioral artifact-transfer CI contracts.
* Added explicit no-downstream-rebuild enforcement.

#### Validation

* Canonical package artifacts are built once in the producer job.
* Downstream validation consumes the transferred artifact bytes.
* Canonical Build Evidence remains separate from package candidates.
* Identical transferred bytes pass integrity verification.
* Mutated, missing, and unexpected artifacts fail integrity
  verification.
* External artifact-transfer actions remain pinned to commit SHA.
* Levels 28 and 29 CI policy contracts remain green.

Level 30 — Artifact Transfer Across CI Jobs is complete.

### Level 31 — Build-Once-Promote

Completed canonical Build-to-Release handoff semantics.

#### Added

* Added explicit Release handoff eligibility to the canonical Build
  Result.
* Added immutable `ReleaseHandoff` representation preserving Build ID,
  artifact manifest, validation result, and Build Evidence reference.
* Added artifact-path and digest projections derived directly from the
  canonical artifact manifest.
* Added a downstream handoff-consumption boundary that preserves the
  exact established Build authorities.
* Added a canonical CI `release-handoff` stage that consumes already
  validated package candidates and Build Evidence without rebuilding.
* Added structural contracts preventing silent downstream rebuild,
  authority substitution, digest recalculation, and Build-owned release
  publication.

#### Validation

* Trusted artifact eligibility requires successful execution and Build
  Validation with matching Build IDs.
* Artifact manifest and validation authorities must belong to the same
  canonical Build ID.
* Trusted artifact paths and digests remain derived from the canonical
  manifest.
* Transferred artifacts are integrity-verified before the Release
  handoff stage.
* Release handoff consumes the existing package candidates and Build
  Evidence.
* No downstream package rebuild is permitted.
* Build does not publish, approve, promote, authorize, or deploy a
  release.

Level 31 — Build-Once-Promote is complete at 9/9.

### Level 40 — Reproducibility Baseline Progress — 2026-08-26

Advanced the Level 40 reproducibility baseline by controlling unnecessary
wall-clock influence at the canonical Python package-builder boundary.

`PythonPackageBuilder` now supplies canonical
`SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=315532800` and overrides any inherited caller value.

Focused tests verify canonical timestamp normalization.

Repeated real canonical builds established that:

* the Python wheel is byte-for-byte reproducible under the tested controlled
  inputs;
* wheel size, SHA-256, contents, and member timestamps are identical;
* the source distribution remains logically equivalent but not byte-for-byte
  reproducible because the standard packaging backend retains temporal archive
  metadata.

A follow-up falsification experiment normalized staged input mtimes and showed
that the residual source-distribution variability still remained, confirming
that the remaining temporal metadata is generated by the packaging backend
rather than by FamilyOS input staging.

No custom source-distribution rewriting is introduced.

This closes the Level 40 checklist items for removing unnecessary
time-dependent artifact influence at the current FamilyOS-controlled boundary
and comparing repeated builds.

Level 40 currently stands at 5/11.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

### Level 40 — Existing Reproducibility Contract Closures — 2026-08-26

Closed three Level 40 reproducibility requirements using existing canonical
Build behavior and focused validation evidence.

No new production implementation was required.

The audit confirmed:

* deterministic configuration resolution;
* explicit critical toolchain version identity;
* normalized ordering where relevant.

Focused validation completed successfully:

* configuration contract: 54 tests;
* toolchain contract: 30 tests;
* ordering contract: 98 tests.

Level 40 advances from 5/11 to 8/11.

The remaining requirements are canonical source identity, removal of
unnecessary random artifact influence, and reduction of uncontrolled network
dependency.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

### Level 40 — Random Artifact Isolation — 2026-08-26

Validated that random canonical Build identity does not influence trusted
package artifact content.

Two real canonical builds generated distinct UUID-based Build IDs while
producing the same logical package artifacts.

The Python wheel remained byte-for-byte identical with the same SHA-256.
Source-distribution file contents also remained identical, with residual byte
differences limited to the already documented temporal archive metadata.

No Build ID value appeared inside either artifact class, and the canonical
Python package builder has no Build ID or UUID dependency.

Build ID randomness remains intentionally scoped to execution identity and
Build authority correlation.

This closes the Level 40 requirement to remove unnecessary random artifact
influence.

Level 40 advances from 8/11 to 9/11.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

### Level 40 — Canonical Source Identity Closure — 2026-08-26

Closed the Level 40 canonical source identity requirement using existing
Build architecture and focused validation evidence.

No new production implementation was required.

Canonical source identity already captures the exact Git commit revision
and working-tree dirty state before package construction.

The captured source authority is propagated through Build Context, Artifact
Identity, and Build Evidence.

Existing behavioral coverage includes clean and dirty repositories, staged
and unstaged changes, deletions, untracked files, detached and tagged
checkouts, shallow repositories, repositories without an initial commit,
non-Git directories, unavailable Git execution, and nested-project
repository-boundary rejection.

Release-candidate validation also enforces valid source authority before
package execution.

This closes the Level 40 requirement to establish canonical source identity.

Level 40 advances from 9/11 to 10/11.

The sole remaining Level 40 requirement is reduction of uncontrolled
network dependency.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

### Level 40 — Network Dependency Closure — 2026-08-26

Closed the final Level 40 reproducibility requirement by validating that
network dependency is constrained by repository-owned dependency authority.

Canonical package construction supplies committed `requirements.txt` through
the `pypa/build` dependency-constraints interface, and integration coverage
demonstrates constraint enforcement across both isolated backend environments.

Canonical CI installs locked dependencies before FamilyOS without further
dependency resolution. A separate cache-free validation path confirms that
cache state is not authoritative.

No arbitrary live external service dependency was found in canonical Build
application or infrastructure authorities.

Network or cache access may still supply constrained dependency bytes.
Complete offline construction remains a stronger future maturity capability
and is not claimed by this closure.

This closes:

```text
Reduce uncontrolled network dependency.
```

Level 40 — Reproducibility Baseline advances from 10/11 to 11/11 and is
complete.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

### Level 41 — Build Context Fingerprint — 2026-08-26

Implemented canonical Build Context fingerprinting for reproducibility and
future cache-oriented identity.

Added immutable BuildContextFingerprint and deterministic
BuildContextFingerprinter.

Canonical fingerprint inputs now cover source, runtime, dependency state,
critical toolchain state, relevant environment state, and effective Build
configuration.

Execution-specific identity such as Build ID, output paths, temporary
directories, and virtual-environment activation is intentionally excluded.

Fingerprint serialization is versioned and deterministic and uses SHA-256.

Build Evidence now requires and carries the fingerprint, while deterministic
Build Evidence JSON exposes its algorithm and digest.

Explicit semantic fingerprint comparison is available through
BuildContextFingerprint.matches().

Focused and complete Build regressions remained green.

Level 41 — Build Context Fingerprint is complete at 10/10.

Framework version 1.0.0 and immutable historical publication tag
v4.7.0-build-framework remain unchanged.

### Level 42 — Reproducibility Testing — 2026-08-26

Implemented canonical artifact reproducibility comparison for equivalent Build
Contexts.

Added deterministic semantic package-content snapshots, archive metadata
observation, reproducibility classifications, explicit expected-variability
policy, and aggregate artifact comparison.

Real repeated canonical builds confirmed that the Python wheel is bit-for-bit
equivalent.

The source distribution is logically equivalent: semantic member content is
identical while raw archive bytes vary because of timestamp metadata.

Timestamp-only source-distribution variability is explicitly classified as
expected. Changed semantic content remains non-reproducible.

Periodic reproducibility CI was evaluated and intentionally deferred until a
canonical reproducibility runner owns repeated-build orchestration and CI
result semantics.

Level 42 — Reproducibility Testing is complete at 9/9.

Framework version 1.0.0 and immutable historical publication tag
v4.7.0-build-framework remain unchanged.

### Level 43 — Supply Chain Evidence — 2026-08-26

Established the current canonical Build provenance boundary.

Added the internal `BuildProvenance` model and `BuildProvenanceFactory`.

Build Provenance now preserves existing Build Evidence authorities for Build
ID, Build Context fingerprint, source state, dependency state, critical
toolchain state, environment state, and artifact integrity records.

The new provenance authority is exposed through the public Build application
boundary.

Dependency-source evidence is intentionally limited to the canonical
repository-controlled dependency declaration and lock authorities currently
observable through `DependencyState`. No registry, mirror, index URL, PyPI
origin, upstream repository, or network-resolution provenance is inferred.

Builder identity was evaluated and intentionally deferred to Level 46 —
Controlled Builder Evaluation because the current framework has no
authenticated builder-identity authority.

Industry-standard provenance formats were evaluated. in-toto Statement and
SLSA Provenance remain the intended future direction when the required
builder and attestation authorities exist.

No proprietary FamilyOS provenance JSON format, SLSA statement, in-toto
attestation, signature, `BuilderIdentity`, `DependencySourceState`, or
provider-specific runner identity was introduced.

Final validation completed successfully with 12 focused provenance tests,
704 Build application tests, 30 Build infrastructure tests, 47 Build CLI /
rendering tests, Ruff PASS, MyPy PASS, public-import validation PASS, and
`git diff --check` PASS.

Level 43 closes at the current maturity boundary as 7/8 satisfied plus one
explicit architectural deferral to Level 46.

Framework version 1.0.0 and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

### Level 44 — SBOM Evaluation — 2026-08-26

Completed the architectural evaluation of Software Bill of Materials
generation.

Identified runtime dependency inventory, vulnerability analysis, supply-chain
transparency, release composition evidence, and historical investigation as
potential SBOM use cases.

Established the current canonical Python wheel and source distribution as the
relevant artifact scope.

Evaluated the required artifact-composition depth as the runtime dependency
closure, including direct and applicable transitive runtime dependencies.

SPDX and CycloneDX were evaluated as viable future standard representations.

Security Architecture and Release Evidence integration were evaluated
positively.

SBOM implementation was intentionally deferred because FamilyOS does not yet
establish canonical resolved dependency-graph identity suitable for
authoritative SBOM generation.

Future adoption must go through cross-cutting architecture governance because
SBOM semantics affect Build, Security, and Release Evidence architecture.

No SBOM generator, SPDX or CycloneDX implementation, dependency-inventory
authority, new SBOM dependency, package-URL authority, or CI SBOM pipeline was
introduced.

Level 44 — SBOM Evaluation is complete at 8/8.

Framework version 1.0.0 and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.


### Level 45 — Artifact Signing Evaluation — 2026-08-26

Artifact Signing Evaluation was completed without introducing signing
implementation or a new trust claim.

The evaluation confirmed that current artifact SHA-256 integrity records and
Build Provenance are evidence authorities, not cryptographic signer-authenticity
claims. A future signing architecture must define signing authority, identity
and key lifecycle, verification policy, CI permission boundaries, Release
integration, rotation, revocation, and cross-framework trust semantics before
adoption.

No signing technology or format was selected. No `ArtifactSignature`, signer,
signing service, signing key, certificate identity, CI signing secret, OIDC
`id-token` permission, Sigstore/Cosign/GPG dependency, or signature
verification runtime was introduced.

Future adoption must pass architecture governance. A cross-framework signing
and trust model spanning Build, Release, Security, and CI may require an RFC.
Level 46 Controlled Builder Evaluation may inform later builder-identity and
attestation work without making builder identity equivalent to release signing
authority.

**Artifact Signing Adoption: Deferred by Governance.**


### Level 46 — Controlled Builder Evaluation — 2026-08-26

Controlled Builder Evaluation was completed without introducing new build
infrastructure.

The evaluation identified the residual reproducibility boundary around host
operating-system images, provider runner-image lifecycle, preinstalled system
state, underlying infrastructure, and authenticated builder identity. Stronger
isolation through containers, immutable images, dedicated runners, or remote
workers could reduce that state and improve high-trust release assurance.

The current combination of ephemeral CI runners, explicit dependency
installation, virtual environments, canonical runtime and toolchain policy,
environment-state capture, cache-free validation, Build Evidence, and
reproducibility testing remains proportionate to demonstrated FamilyOS needs.

Container and image maintenance, security patching, developer overhead,
dedicated-runner operations, immutable-image governance, and remote-worker
infrastructure were evaluated as material adoption costs.

No Docker/container canonical build, immutable build image, dedicated or
self-hosted build runner, remote build worker, or authenticated
`BuilderIdentity` was introduced. Provider runner metadata and observed
environment state remain non-authoritative for builder identity.

Future controlled-builder adoption requires architecture governance and must
preserve provider independence, local developer usability, canonical Build
Context, and Build Evidence semantics.

**Controlled Builder Adoption: Deferred Until Demonstrated Need.**


### Level 47 — Artifact Registry Evaluation — 2026-08-26

Artifact Registry Evaluation was completed without introducing persistent
registry infrastructure or package publication behavior.

The evaluation confirmed that current GitHub Actions artifact transfer is
sufficient for canonical CI validation and Release Handoff, including transfer
of package candidates and Build Evidence followed by integrity verification.
This storage is treated as temporary workflow infrastructure rather than a
durable distribution repository.

Future registry value was identified for durable retention, cross-workflow
retrieval, immutable promotion, controlled distribution, rollback/recovery,
and repository-level retention or access policy.

The Build/Release ownership boundary remains unchanged: Build owns artifact
construction, identity, integrity, validation, evidence, and validated handoff;
Release owns promotion, publication, distribution policy, and consumer-facing
release channels.

No retention duration, registry provider, publication credential, registry
client, registry-specific dependency, or Build-owned publishing authority was
introduced. Existing repository capabilities must be evaluated before custom
infrastructure is considered.

Artifact digests in canonical Build Evidence remain the integrity authority,
and future promotion must preserve the already validated artifact bytes rather
than rebuilding them.

**Artifact Registry Adoption: Deferred Until Release Distribution Requires Persistent Artifact Storage.**

### Level 48 — Remote Build Execution Evaluation — 2026-08-26

Completed Level 48 — Remote Build Execution Evaluation.

The evaluation measured the current Build execution baseline before considering
distributed infrastructure. Build application, infrastructure, CLI, Ruff, and
MyPy validation remain fast, while recent Canonical CI Validation runs complete
in approximately 1m24s–1m58s.

No demonstrated Build scalability limitation currently requires remote
execution.

Repository inspection confirmed that no remote or distributed Build execution
implementation is present.

The existing CI dependency cache remains a bounded performance optimization and
is independently checked by the cache-free validation path. Any future remote
cache or remote execution capability must preserve input-aware cache
correctness, integrity, reproducibility, and contamination protections.

Remote execution would introduce additional worker, scheduling, transport,
observability, maintenance, security, identity, and trust-boundary complexity
that is not justified by the current measured workload.

Build governance requires RFC-level architectural review before remote
execution adoption.

Decision:

**Remote Build Execution Adoption: Deferred Until Demonstrated Scalability
Need.**

No remote worker, distributed build system, remote execution service, remote
cache, dependency, or CI execution authority was introduced by this Level.

Level 48 is complete at 8/8.

### Level 49 — Performance Optimization — 2026-08-26

Completed Level 49 — Performance Optimization.

The Build performance baseline was measured across dependency installation,
testing, package construction, quality validation, and recent Canonical CI
execution.

Observed dependency installation completed in 4.50s with available pip cache
and 11.44s with `--no-cache-dir`. The canonical package build completed in
2.98s. Build application, infrastructure, and CLI tests remained fast, and
combined Build-scope validation completed with 763 tests passing.

The existing dependency cache provides measurable performance value while the
cache-free validation path preserves cache-independent correctness.

Parallel validation and incremental execution were evaluated. No additional
parallel orchestration, incremental Build state, Build cache, or
skip-unchanged execution semantics were introduced because the current
measurements do not demonstrate sufficient benefit to justify the added
complexity.

No new optimization was adopted. Canonical Build semantics were revalidated
after the evaluation and performance was re-measured.

The Build Framework continues to prioritize correctness, reliability,
reproducibility, and validation ahead of performance.

Decision:

**Performance Optimization Adoption: No Additional Optimization Justified At Current Measured Scale.**

Level 49 is complete at 11/11.

### Level 50 — Final Build Framework Implementation Validation — 2026-08-26

Completed the final implementation validation of EPIC-BLD-001.

The mandatory Level 50 implementation contract is complete at 19/19.

The final validation confirms canonical Build execution, explicit profiles and
Build Context, reconstructable environment and dependency state, explicit
configuration precedence, observable execution, candidate artifacts, automated
artifact validation, artifact integrity, canonical Build Evidence, canonical
CI invocation, local/CI alignment, security boundaries, operational Build
Governance, and exact validated-byte Release Handoff.

Historical checklist and Definition-of-Done criteria satisfied by subsequent
implementation Levels were reconciled with the demonstrated current state.

Conditional and higher-maturity capabilities remain explicitly governed rather
than falsely represented as implemented. These include independent plugin or
documentation Build targets absent demonstrated need, dependency-graph identity,
non-required potential Build metrics, and authenticated builder identity
deferred by the Controlled Builder Evaluation.

Strong reproducibility is complete at the governed Build Framework scope.
Bit-for-bit reproducibility remains a separate higher-maturity target.

This closure is documentation-only. Production Build code, tests, dependency
state, CI execution semantics, publication, signing, promotion, deployment, and
the immutable historical publication tag remain unchanged.

**EPIC-BLD-001 Build Framework Implementation: Completed and Validated.**

Level 50 is complete at 19/19.
