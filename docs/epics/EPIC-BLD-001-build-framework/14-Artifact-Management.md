# Build Framework

## 14 Artifact Management

### Overview

EPIC-BLD-001 — Build Framework defines how FamilyOS build artifacts are identified, classified, validated, described, stored, traced, and handed off to downstream engineering processes.

An artifact is not merely a file produced by a build.

Within the FamilyOS Build Framework, an artifact is a controlled engineering output associated with sufficient identity, metadata, integrity information, validation state, and build context to make its origin understandable.

The purpose of this document is to establish a consistent artifact model across FamilyOS build activities.

The central principle is:

> A build output becomes an engineering artifact only when FamilyOS can identify what it is, where it came from, and whether it can be trusted.

---

## Purpose

The Artifact Management model defines how FamilyOS handles outputs generated through Build Execution.

It establishes requirements for:

* artifact discovery;
* artifact classification;
* artifact identity;
* artifact naming;
* artifact metadata;
* artifact integrity;
* artifact validation state;
* artifact sets;
* output locations;
* artifact storage;
* artifact retention;
* artifact immutability;
* artifact traceability;
* artifact evidence;
* release handoff;
* artifact lifecycle management.

The objective is to ensure that build outputs remain controlled from creation through downstream consumption.

---

## Artifact Definition

A FamilyOS artifact is a build output with explicit engineering meaning.

Conceptually:

```text
Artifact
│
├── Identity
├── Type
├── Origin
├── Build Association
├── Metadata
├── Integrity
├── Validation State
└── Evidence References
```

A raw generated file may become an artifact only after the build system identifies and classifies it.

---

## Artifact Versus Raw Output

Build execution can produce many files.

Not all of them are artifacts.

The relationship is:

```text
Build Execution
      ↓
Raw Outputs
      ↓
Discovery
      ↓
Classification
      ↓
Artifacts
```

Raw outputs may include:

* temporary files;
* intermediate files;
* cache content;
* staging directories;
* logs;
* candidate artifacts.

Only explicitly classified outputs should participate in artifact trust.

---

## Artifact Principle 1 — Artifacts Must Be Explicit

FamilyOS should not determine important artifacts through guesswork.

The preferred model is:

```text
Expected Artifact Definition
          ↓
Build Execution
          ↓
Artifact Discovery
          ↓
Known Artifact
```

The anti-pattern is:

```text
Build Directory
      ↓
Find Whatever Looks Important
```

---

## Artifact Principle 2 — Artifacts Must Have Identity

Every significant artifact SHOULD have sufficient identity to distinguish it from unrelated outputs.

Identity may include:

* name;
* type;
* version context;
* build identifier;
* source revision;
* platform context;
* checksum.

The exact identity model depends on artifact class.

---

## Artifact Principle 3 — Artifact Origin Must Be Traceable

A trusted artifact should be traceable to the build that produced it.

The canonical relationship is:

```text
Artifact
   ↓
Build ID
   ↓
Build Context
   ↓
Source Revision
```

Artifact origin must not rely solely on a filename.

---

## Artifact Principle 4 — Integrity Must Be Verifiable

Important artifacts SHOULD support integrity verification.

The most common mechanism is a cryptographic checksum.

Conceptually:

```text
Artifact Bytes
      ↓
Integrity Function
      ↓
Artifact Digest
```

Integrity information helps detect accidental or unauthorized modification.

---

## Artifact Principle 5 — Validation State Must Be Explicit

A generated artifact is not automatically trusted.

Artifact state should distinguish between:

```text
Generated
Validated
Trusted
Rejected
```

This prevents downstream systems from confusing artifact existence with artifact validity.

---

## Artifact Principle 6 — Trusted Artifacts Must Be Immutable In Practice

Once an artifact has been validated and declared trusted, its bytes should not be modified without invalidating the previous trust state.

The correct relationship is:

```text
Artifact
   ↓
Validation
   ↓
Trusted Artifact
   ↓
Modification
   ↓
New Artifact State Required
```

---

## Artifact Principle 7 — Artifact Metadata Must Be Controlled

Artifact metadata is part of artifact identity and traceability.

Metadata must not be generated from uncontrolled state.

---

## Artifact Principle 8 — Artifact Storage Must Preserve Identity

Moving an artifact between storage locations must not make its identity ambiguous.

The artifact should remain identifiable independently from its path.

---

## Artifact Principle 9 — Artifact Handoff Must Be Explicit

The Release Framework should receive an explicit artifact set.

It should not search arbitrary build directories for candidate files.

---

## Artifact Principle 10 — Artifact Management Must Remain Tool-Independent

The artifact model must remain valid even when package formats, registries, or storage mechanisms change.

FamilyOS defines artifact semantics before choosing artifact infrastructure.

---

## Artifact Classes

FamilyOS may produce multiple artifact classes.

Examples include:

* Python wheel;
* source distribution;
* plugin package;
* generated documentation bundle;
* generated schema package;
* metadata bundle;
* manifest;
* validation report;
* provenance record;
* release candidate bundle.

Not all artifact classes require identical handling.

---

## Primary Artifacts

Primary artifacts are the main distributable outputs of a build.

Examples may include:

```text
familyos_cli-<version>.whl
familyos_cli-<version>.tar.gz
```

Primary artifacts are typically the outputs most likely to proceed toward release.

---

## Secondary Artifacts

Secondary artifacts support the primary build output.

Examples include:

* manifests;
* checksums;
* metadata bundles;
* validation reports;
* documentation packages.

Secondary artifacts may be required for release evidence or operational support.

---

## Evidence Artifacts

Some build evidence may itself be represented as an artifact.

Examples include:

* build manifest;
* validation report;
* dependency report;
* provenance record;
* checksum file.

Evidence artifacts should remain associated with the build that generated them.

---

## Intermediate Outputs

Intermediate outputs are not trusted artifacts.

Examples include:

* staging trees;
* generated temporary metadata;
* extracted package directories;
* compiler intermediates.

They exist only to support execution.

---

## Temporary Outputs

Temporary outputs exist only during build execution or diagnostics.

They should remain disposable.

---

## Artifact Lifecycle

The canonical artifact lifecycle is:

```text
Generate
   ↓
Discover
   ↓
Classify
   ↓
Identify
   ↓
Validate
   ↓
Record Metadata
   ↓
Establish Integrity
   ↓
Declare Trust
   ↓
Store / Handoff
   ↓
Retain / Retire
```

The lifecycle separates artifact creation from artifact trust.

---

## Phase 1 — Artifact Generation

Artifact generation occurs during Build Execution.

At this stage, the output is considered a candidate artifact.

It must not yet be assumed valid.

---

## Phase 2 — Artifact Discovery

Discovery determines which expected outputs were actually created.

The build system may compare:

```text
Expected Outputs
       ↓
Actual Outputs
       ↓
Discovery Result
```

Missing required outputs should fail the build.

---

## Phase 3 — Artifact Classification

Artifact classification assigns semantic type.

Examples include:

```text
PYTHON_WHEEL
SOURCE_DISTRIBUTION
PLUGIN_BUNDLE
DOCUMENTATION_BUNDLE
VALIDATION_REPORT
PROVENANCE_RECORD
```

A formal enumeration may be introduced later.

---

## Phase 4 — Artifact Identification

Identification establishes sufficient identity for future reference.

A conceptual artifact identifier may include:

```text
ArtifactIdentity
│
├── Component
├── Artifact Type
├── Version Context
├── Build ID
└── Integrity Digest
```

The exact implementation is not yet prescribed.

---

## Phase 5 — Artifact Validation

Artifact validation confirms that the output satisfies its applicable requirements.

Validation may include:

* existence;
* structure;
* format;
* metadata;
* package contents;
* installability;
* integrity;
* policy;
* compliance.

---

## Phase 6 — Artifact Metadata

Metadata is associated with the artifact after or during generation.

The metadata model must support traceability.

---

## Phase 7 — Integrity Establishment

Integrity information should be calculated from the final candidate bytes.

The sequence is:

```text
Final Candidate Bytes
        ↓
Calculate Digest
        ↓
Record Integrity
```

No later mutation should occur without recalculation and revalidation.

---

## Phase 8 — Trust Declaration

A candidate artifact becomes trusted only after all required conditions succeed.

Conceptually:

```text
Candidate Artifact
       ↓
Required Validation
       ↓
Integrity Established
       ↓
Evidence Available
       ↓
Trusted Artifact
```

---

## Phase 9 — Storage Or Handoff

Trusted artifacts may then be:

* stored;
* uploaded to CI artifact storage;
* included in a release candidate set;
* handed to the Release Framework.

---

## Phase 10 — Retention Or Retirement

Artifacts eventually reach an end-of-life state.

Possible actions include:

* retention;
* archival;
* supersession;
* deletion;
* release promotion.

Detailed release retention policy remains outside Build Framework ownership.

---

## Artifact Identity Model

Artifact identity should allow FamilyOS to answer:

```text
Which artifact is this?

Which build produced it?

Which source revision produced it?

Which artifact class does it belong to?

Has its content changed?
```

---

## Artifact Name

Artifact name should reflect its logical component.

For example:

```text
familyos-cli
```

or a future plugin identifier.

Naming conventions should remain aligned with project and release conventions.

---

## Artifact Type

Artifact type defines the technical class of the output.

Examples include:

* wheel;
* source distribution;
* documentation package;
* manifest;
* plugin bundle.

Type determines applicable validation.

---

## Artifact Version Context

Artifacts may carry version information.

Version semantics are governed primarily by the Release Framework.

The Build Framework ensures that version context used during build is explicit and traceable.

---

## Build Association

Every trusted artifact SHOULD be associated with the Build ID that produced it.

This relationship enables:

```text
Build
│
├── Artifact A
├── Artifact B
└── Artifact C
```

and reverse lookup:

```text
Artifact
   ↓
Build
```

---

## Source Association

A build may associate artifacts with:

* Git commit;
* repository revision;
* working tree state.

Release-oriented artifacts should use stronger source identity than ordinary local builds.

---

## Artifact Checksum

A checksum provides content-based integrity identity.

Suitable cryptographic hashes may be used.

The exact algorithm should be governed if standardized.

---

## Artifact Naming

Artifact filenames should be predictable.

Naming may include:

* project;
* version;
* artifact type;
* platform;
* architecture.

The Build Framework should respect ecosystem-standard naming when available.

---

## Artifact Naming Principle

FamilyOS should not invent custom naming conventions when an artifact ecosystem already defines a reliable standard.

For Python packaging, ecosystem conventions should be preserved.

---

## Artifact Metadata Model

Artifact metadata may include:

```text
ArtifactMetadata
│
├── Artifact Name
├── Artifact Type
├── Build ID
├── Source Revision
├── Version Context
├── Build Profile
├── Toolchain Context
├── Dependency Context
├── Integrity
├── Validation Status
└── Creation Context
```

Not all fields must be physically embedded in every artifact.

Metadata may be maintained in associated evidence.

---

## Embedded Metadata

Some metadata belongs inside the artifact format.

Examples may include:

* package name;
* package version;
* dependencies;
* platform metadata.

Embedded metadata should follow ecosystem standards.

---

## External Metadata

Additional Build Framework metadata may remain outside artifact bytes.

Examples include:

* Build ID;
* validation report;
* source revision;
* build environment;
* provenance.

This avoids modifying standardized artifact formats unnecessarily.

---

## Metadata Source Of Truth

Artifact metadata must be derived from controlled sources.

The framework should avoid generating conflicting metadata from:

* source file A;
* environment variable B;
* CI variable C;
* release script D.

Canonical ownership must be clear.

---

## Metadata Consistency

Metadata should be validated across related sources.

For example:

```text
Project Metadata
       =
Artifact Metadata
```

where they represent the same semantic property.

Mismatch should fail trusted artifact creation.

---

## Artifact Integrity

Artifact integrity confirms whether artifact bytes remain unchanged.

Integrity does not prove artifact correctness.

It proves content stability relative to a recorded digest.

---

## Integrity Model

```text
Artifact
   ↓
Hash
   ↓
Digest
```

Later:

```text
Artifact
   ↓
Hash
   ↓
Compare With Digest
```

---

## Integrity And Trust

Artifact trust requires more than checksum validity.

The relationship is:

```text
Integrity
   +
Validation
   +
Traceability
   +
Evidence
   ↓
Trust
```

A malicious artifact can still have a valid checksum if the checksum was generated after compromise.

---

## Artifact Validation

Artifact validation is defined in greater detail in `15-Build-Validation.md`.

Artifact Management defines how validation state is attached to outputs.

---

## Artifact Validation States

A conceptual state model may include:

```text
UNVALIDATED
    ↓
VALIDATING
    ↓
VALID
```

or:

```text
INVALID
```

A formal state model may be introduced later.

---

## Trusted Artifact

A trusted artifact is one that satisfies the applicable build-profile trust requirements.

This may mean different things depending on intended use.

---

## Development Artifact Trust

A development artifact may be trusted for:

* local testing;
* manual inspection;
* development workflows.

It may not satisfy release-candidate requirements.

---

## CI Artifact Trust

A CI artifact may be trusted for:

* automated integration;
* independent validation;
* diagnostic distribution.

Its evidence requirements may be stronger than local builds.

---

## Release Candidate Artifact Trust

A release candidate artifact SHOULD satisfy the strongest applicable Build Framework controls.

Possible requirements include:

* known source revision;
* controlled dependency state;
* canonical toolchain;
* full validation;
* integrity digest;
* artifact metadata;
* build evidence.

---

## Artifact Set

A build may produce multiple artifacts that form one logical set.

Conceptually:

```text
ArtifactSet
│
├── Primary Artifact
├── Source Artifact
├── Documentation Artifact
├── Manifest
├── Validation Report
└── Integrity Data
```

The set should share one build association.

---

## Artifact Set Identity

A Build ID may serve as the common identity binding multiple artifacts together.

A future explicit Artifact Set ID may be introduced if required.

---

## Artifact Relationships

Artifacts may relate to one another.

Examples include:

```text
Wheel
   ↔
Source Distribution
```

or:

```text
Package
   ↔
Validation Report
```

or:

```text
Plugin Bundle
   ↔
Compliance Evidence
```

These relationships should remain explicit where useful.

---

## Artifact Dependency

One artifact may become input to another build.

The required relationship is:

```text
Artifact A
   ↓
Validate
   ↓
Use As Build Input
   ↓
Artifact B
```

Upstream artifact trust must not be assumed blindly.

---

## Artifact Output Locations

Artifacts should be written into predictable locations.

A canonical build might use conventional locations such as:

```text
dist/
```

The exact location may vary.

The principle is predictable discovery.

---

## Output Directory Requirements

An artifact output directory should be:

* clearly distinguished from source;
* safe to clean;
* easy for automation to collect;
* excluded from authoritative repository state unless intentionally committed.

---

## Profile-Specific Output

Different profiles may use logically distinct output spaces.

For example:

```text
development
ci
release-candidate
```

This reduces accidental overwrite and ambiguity.

---

## Artifact Storage

The Build Framework distinguishes artifact generation from long-term storage.

Storage mechanisms may include:

* local filesystem;
* CI artifact storage;
* future artifact registry;
* release staging storage.

The framework does not require a dedicated artifact registry at current maturity.

---

## Local Artifact Storage

Local artifacts may remain temporary.

Developers should be able to clean them safely.

---

## CI Artifact Storage

CI may retain artifacts for:

* validation;
* debugging;
* downstream jobs;
* manual inspection.

CI storage duration is an implementation policy.

---

## Release Candidate Storage

Release candidate artifacts should be stored in a way that preserves:

* identity;
* integrity;
* evidence association.

Promotion should use the same validated bytes.

---

## Rebuild Versus Promote

A critical artifact principle is:

> A validated release candidate should ideally be promoted, not rebuilt differently at each downstream stage.

The preferred model is:

```text
Build Once
    ↓
Validate
    ↓
Promote Same Artifact
```

rather than:

```text
Build
  ↓
Validate
  ↓
Rebuild
  ↓
Release Different Bytes
```

This strengthens release confidence.

---

## Artifact Promotion

Promotion changes artifact lifecycle status, not artifact content.

Examples may include:

```text
CI Artifact
     ↓
Release Candidate
     ↓
Official Release
```

The Release Framework owns promotion policy.

---

## Artifact Immutability

Promotion should preserve artifact bytes.

If content changes, a new build and validation cycle is required.

---

## Artifact Retention

Artifact retention may vary by profile.

For example:

```text
Development
    ↓
Short / Local

CI
    ↓
Temporary Controlled Retention

Release Candidate
    ↓
Stronger Retention
```

Retention requirements should remain proportional.

---

## Artifact Deletion

Deletion must not destroy required release or audit evidence.

The Build Framework defines association.

Specific retention periods belong to operational or release policy.

---

## Artifact Cleanup

Build cleanup should remove obsolete derived output without touching authoritative source.

A clean command may remove:

* build directories;
* distribution directories;
* temporary artifact metadata;
* validation staging.

---

## Artifact Repository Cleanliness

Generated artifacts should not normally be committed to source control unless explicitly required.

Version control should represent source and configuration, not routine distribution output.

---

## Version-Controlled Artifacts

Some generated assets may intentionally be committed.

When this occurs, they should be treated as generated authoritative derivatives with explicit rules.

Routine package artifacts should normally remain outside source control.

---

## Artifact Manifest

A build may generate an artifact manifest.

A conceptual manifest may contain:

```text
ArtifactManifest
│
├── Build ID
├── Artifact Entries
│   ├── Name
│   ├── Type
│   ├── Path
│   ├── Size
│   └── Digest
└── Validation State
```

This can strengthen artifact discovery and handoff.

---

## Manifest Benefits

A manifest provides:

* explicit artifact enumeration;
* integrity references;
* automation support;
* release handoff clarity.

A formal manifest is a maturity capability, not necessarily an immediate requirement.

---

## Artifact Evidence

Artifact-specific evidence may include:

* integrity digest;
* validation report;
* package metadata validation;
* installation result;
* content inspection;
* compliance status.

Evidence should remain linked to artifact identity.

---

## Artifact Provenance

Provenance describes where and how an artifact was produced.

A conceptual provenance relationship is:

```text
Artifact
   ↓
Build ID
   ↓
Source
Dependencies
Toolchain
Environment
```

Future FamilyOS maturity may introduce formal provenance attestations.

---

## Provenance Principle

Provenance should evolve from existing Build Evidence rather than become a disconnected parallel system.

---

## Artifact Signing

Artifact signing may eventually provide cryptographic authenticity.

Signing is distinct from checksumming.

```text
Checksum
   ↓
Integrity

Signature
   ↓
Authenticity + Integrity Binding
```

Signing should be introduced when FamilyOS release and distribution requirements justify it.

---

## Signing Boundary

Artifact signing may belong partly to the Release Framework because signing may represent official release authority.

The Build Framework should prepare compatible artifact identity and integrity mechanisms.

---

## Artifact Security

Artifact management must protect against:

* tampering;
* secret leakage;
* unintended file inclusion;
* untrusted artifact substitution;
* stale artifact reuse.

---

## Secret Leakage Validation

Artifacts SHOULD be checked where practical to ensure they do not contain:

* private keys;
* credentials;
* environment files;
* access tokens;
* sensitive local configuration.

The specific validation mechanism may evolve.

---

## Artifact Substitution Risk

A trusted artifact should remain bound to its integrity information.

Downstream processes should not substitute another file with the same filename.

---

## Artifact Path Security

Artifact names and paths should be handled safely.

Build tooling should avoid path traversal or uncontrolled path construction from external inputs.

---

## Artifact Permissions

Generated artifact file permissions should be appropriate for distribution.

Unexpected executable permissions or overly broad permissions should be avoided.

---

## Artifact Observability

The build system should report artifact information such as:

* artifact name;
* artifact type;
* artifact path;
* size;
* validation state;
* digest where available.

This improves transparency.

---

## Artifact Metrics

Potential artifact metrics include:

* number of artifacts;
* artifact size;
* artifact validation failure rate;
* unexpected output rate;
* artifact generation duration.

Metrics should be introduced only when useful.

---

## Artifact Size

Unexpected artifact size growth may indicate:

* accidental file inclusion;
* dependency bundling;
* generated resource changes.

Size can therefore be a useful diagnostic indicator.

---

## Artifact Comparison

Future build tooling may compare artifacts across builds.

Comparison may include:

* file size;
* metadata;
* package contents;
* checksums;
* dependency metadata.

This may support reproducibility analysis.

---

## Reproducible Artifact Comparison

A stronger build system may evaluate:

```text
Build A Artifact
       ↓
Compare
       ↑
Build B Artifact
```

for equivalent build contexts.

Differences should be explainable.

---

## Artifact Validation For Python Packages

For Python artifacts, validation may eventually include:

* archive structure;
* package metadata;
* expected package modules;
* dependency metadata;
* wheel naming;
* installation in clean environment;
* import smoke test.

The exact implementation belongs to Build Validation.

---

## Wheel Artifacts

Wheel artifacts are important current FamilyOS package outputs.

Wheel-specific concerns may include:

* filename correctness;
* metadata correctness;
* package contents;
* compatibility tags;
* installation.

---

## Source Distribution Artifacts

Source distributions may require validation of:

* included source;
* project metadata;
* required build files;
* reproducibility of subsequent package build.

A source distribution is not automatically equivalent to the repository state.

---

## Plugin Artifacts

Official plugin artifacts may require additional metadata and compliance evidence.

A conceptual plugin artifact relationship is:

```text
Plugin Source
      ↓
Plugin Build
      ↓
Plugin Artifact
      +
Compliance Evidence
```

---

## Documentation Artifacts

Documentation artifacts may include:

* generated documentation bundle;
* reference package;
* architecture export;
* specification bundle.

Where treated as formal artifacts, the same identity and traceability principles apply.

---

## Validation Report Artifacts

Validation reports may be retained as supporting evidence.

They should clearly reference:

* Build ID;
* target;
* artifact set;
* validation context.

---

## Artifact And Dependency Management

Artifact metadata may expose runtime dependency requirements.

These should remain consistent with canonical dependency declarations.

---

## Artifact And Configuration

Artifact identity may depend on build configuration.

For example:

* profile;
* optional feature selection;
* platform target.

Relevant configuration should remain traceable.

---

## Artifact And Toolchain

Toolchain changes may alter artifact bytes or metadata.

Important artifacts should therefore be associated with the relevant toolchain context.

---

## Artifact And Environment

Platform-specific artifacts may require environment identity.

Purely platform-independent artifacts may require less environment metadata.

---

## Artifact And Testing

Some artifact validations may use the Testing Framework.

Examples include:

* installability tests;
* smoke tests;
* integration tests against packaged artifacts.

Testing policy remains owned by EPIC-TST-001.

---

## Artifact And Quality

Artifact quality may contribute to Quality Framework assessments.

Relevant evidence may include:

* validation success;
* reproducibility;
* integrity;
* packaging correctness.

---

## Artifact And Release

The Build Framework provides the Release Framework with trusted candidate artifacts.

The handoff should include:

```text
Artifact Set
    +
Metadata
    +
Integrity
    +
Validation
    +
Evidence
```

The Release Framework then decides whether promotion is authorized.

---

## Release Handoff Contract

A conceptual release handoff may be:

```text
BuildReleaseHandoff
│
├── Build ID
├── Artifact Manifest
├── Artifact Paths / References
├── Digests
├── Validation Status
└── Evidence References
```

A formal schema may be introduced later.

---

## Artifact Promotion Invariant

The artifact promoted by Release should be the artifact validated by Build.

This is one of the strongest artifact integrity rules in the framework.

---

## Artifact Rebuild Risk

Rebuilding after approval can introduce:

* dependency drift;
* environment drift;
* toolchain drift;
* non-deterministic differences.

Promotion of validated bytes should therefore be preferred.

---

## Artifact Governance

Significant artifact-model changes may require formal review.

Examples include:

* new official artifact type;
* changed artifact naming contract;
* changed integrity standard;
* new manifest schema;
* artifact signing architecture;
* new artifact registry;
* changed release handoff contract.

---

## Artifact Versioning

Artifact version semantics must align with Release Framework policies.

The Build Framework should not invent independent versioning systems.

---

## Artifact Format Evolution

Artifact formats may evolve.

Format changes should consider:

* compatibility;
* tooling;
* release behavior;
* consumers;
* migration.

---

## Artifact Deprecation

Obsolete artifact types should be retired explicitly.

A transition may include:

* deprecation notice;
* dual generation period;
* consumer migration;
* final removal.

---

## Artifact Technical Debt

Artifact debt includes:

* undocumented artifact types;
* ambiguous output directories;
* obsolete package formats;
* missing metadata;
* missing validation;
* multiple files representing the same artifact ambiguously;
* release processes that rebuild instead of promote.

This debt should be reduced.

---

## Artifact Anti-Pattern — Filename Equals Identity

A filename alone is not sufficient identity for high-trust artifacts.

---

## Artifact Anti-Pattern — Build Directory Equals Artifact Set

Everything inside a build directory must not automatically be treated as an artifact.

---

## Artifact Anti-Pattern — Mutation After Validation

A validated artifact must not be modified without revalidation.

---

## Artifact Anti-Pattern — Manual Release Replacement

A release workflow must not replace validated artifacts manually with newly generated files.

---

## Artifact Anti-Pattern — Untracked Metadata

Artifact metadata must not live only in developer notes or chat messages.

---

## Artifact Anti-Pattern — Secret Inclusion

Artifacts must not contain local secrets or credentials.

---

## Artifact Anti-Pattern — Rebuild At Every Stage

CI, release approval, and publication should not independently rebuild the same logical release artifact without strong reason.

---

## Artifact Maturity Model

FamilyOS Artifact Management may evolve through:

```text
Level 1
Known Output Locations

    ↓

Level 2
Explicit Artifact Classes

    ↓

Level 3
Artifact Validation

    ↓

Level 4
Artifact Metadata

    ↓

Level 5
Integrity Digests

    ↓

Level 6
Artifact Manifests

    ↓

Level 7
Formal Provenance

    ↓

Level 8
Signed Artifact Promotion
```

Each maturity level should solve real engineering needs.

---

## Artifact Success Criteria

The Artifact Management model is successful when FamilyOS can answer:

1. which artifacts a build was expected to produce;
2. which artifacts were actually produced;
3. which output class each artifact belongs to;
4. which build produced each artifact;
5. which source revision produced it;
6. which version context applies;
7. whether artifact integrity can be verified;
8. whether applicable validation succeeded;
9. which evidence supports the artifact;
10. where the artifact is stored;
11. whether the artifact has been modified since validation;
12. whether it is eligible for release handoff;
13. whether downstream workflows use the same validated bytes;
14. how obsolete artifacts are retired.

---

## Artifact Invariants

The following invariants should remain true.

### Invariant 1

Raw build output is not automatically an artifact.

### Invariant 2

Every trusted artifact must have identifiable origin.

### Invariant 3

Required artifacts must be explicitly expected.

### Invariant 4

Artifacts must pass applicable validation before trust.

### Invariant 5

Integrity data must correspond to final artifact bytes.

### Invariant 6

Trusted artifacts must not be mutated silently.

### Invariant 7

Temporary outputs must remain distinguishable from trusted artifacts.

### Invariant 8

Release handoff must use explicit artifact references.

### Invariant 9

The artifact promoted downstream should match the artifact validated upstream.

### Invariant 10

Artifact metadata must remain consistent with authoritative project state.

---

## Artifact Management Flow

The canonical FamilyOS artifact flow is:

```text
Build Execution
      ↓
Raw Outputs
      ↓
Discover
      ↓
Classify
      ↓
Identify
      ↓
Validate
      ↓
Establish Integrity
      ↓
Record Metadata
      ↓
Generate Evidence
      ↓
Trusted Artifact Set
      ↓
Release Handoff
```

This flow turns generated files into controlled engineering assets.

---

## Final Principle

The FamilyOS Artifact Management model is founded on the following rule:

> FamilyOS must never promote a file simply because a build produced it; it must promote an identified, validated, traceable, and integrity-protected artifact whose relationship to its build context is understood.

Artifacts are the durable outputs of Build Framework activity.

Their management therefore represents the point where source transformation becomes engineering evidence.

A trustworthy Build Framework must know exactly what it produced, why that output is valid, and whether the same trusted bytes are the ones that progress toward release.
