# Build Framework

## 03 Build Principles

### Overview

EPIC-BLD-001 — Build Framework defines the engineering principles that govern how FamilyOS build capabilities are designed, implemented, executed, validated, automated, maintained, and evolved.

These principles establish the normative foundation of the Build Framework.

They are intended to remain stable even when:

* build tools change;
* packaging technologies evolve;
* CI providers change;
* additional languages are introduced;
* artifact types expand;
* automation becomes more advanced;
* supply-chain controls become stronger.

The Build Framework therefore defines principles before mechanisms.

A tool may change.

A workflow may change.

A package format may change.

The engineering expectations that establish build trust must remain coherent.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of the Build Principles is to ensure that every FamilyOS build capability follows a consistent engineering philosophy.

These principles provide guidance for decisions involving:

* build architecture;
* build inputs;
* build environments;
* dependency management;
* configuration;
* toolchain selection;
* execution;
* artifact production;
* validation;
* automation;
* evidence;
* security;
* observability;
* governance.

They also provide criteria for evaluating proposed build changes.

---

## Principle Model

The FamilyOS Build Framework is based on a layered principle model.

```text
Build Principles
│
├── Trust Principles
│   ├── Reproducibility
│   ├── Determinism
│   ├── Traceability
│   └── Evidence
│
├── Engineering Principles
│   ├── Explicitness
│   ├── Simplicity
│   ├── Modularity
│   ├── Maintainability
│   └── Portability
│
├── Execution Principles
│   ├── Validation
│   ├── Predictability
│   ├── Failure Transparency
│   ├── Automation
│   └── Observability
│
└── Governance Principles
    ├── Security
    ├── Controlled Evolution
    ├── Separation of Responsibilities
    └── Proportionality
```

These principles are complementary.

No single principle defines build quality by itself.

---

## Principle 1 — Reproducibility First

FamilyOS builds SHOULD be reproducible.

Equivalent controlled inputs and equivalent build conditions should produce equivalent results.

The target model is:

```text
Controlled Inputs
       +
Controlled Context
       ↓
Repeatable Build
       ↓
Equivalent Outcome
```

Reproducibility supports:

* debugging;
* validation;
* CI consistency;
* incident investigation;
* artifact verification;
* release confidence;
* long-term maintenance.

Build systems must therefore minimize uncontrolled state.

---

## Reproducibility Requirements

Reproducibility depends on control over several dimensions.

```text
Reproducibility
│
├── Source
├── Dependencies
├── Toolchain
├── Configuration
├── Environment
├── Execution
└── Artifact Generation
```

A build cannot be considered strongly reproducible if any critical dimension remains unknowable.

---

## Practical Reproducibility

FamilyOS does not require immediate perfect bit-for-bit reproducibility for every artifact.

Instead, reproducibility is treated as an engineering maturity objective.

The minimum expectation is:

> Significant differences between equivalent builds must be explainable.

When exact reproducibility is not possible, sources of variability SHOULD be documented.

---

## Principle 2 — Deterministic Processes

Build behavior SHOULD be deterministic wherever technically feasible.

A deterministic build process behaves predictably when provided with the same controlled state.

Potential sources of non-determinism include:

* timestamps;
* random values;
* unordered file traversal;
* network responses;
* host-specific paths;
* environment-dependent defaults;
* mutable dependency resolution;
* external service responses.

These influences SHOULD be eliminated, controlled, or made explicit.

---

## Determinism Rule

The preferred relationship is:

```text
Known State
    ↓
Known Transformation
    ↓
Predictable Result
```

The undesirable relationship is:

```text
Known State
    ↓
Hidden Variables
    ↓
Unpredictable Result
```

---

## Principle 3 — Explicit Inputs

Every significant build input SHOULD be explicit.

Build inputs include more than application source.

They may include:

* source code;
* build scripts;
* configuration;
* schemas;
* templates;
* generated sources;
* assets;
* dependency declarations;
* lock files;
* runtime versions;
* tool versions;
* environment variables;
* policy definitions.

The build system should avoid depending on invisible state.

---

## Explicitness Model

The preferred model is:

```text
Declared Inputs
      ↓
Resolved Build Context
      ↓
Build Execution
```

rather than:

```text
Source Code
    +
Unknown Machine State
    ↓
Build Execution
```

Explicitness is one of the primary mechanisms through which reproducibility is achieved.

---

## Principle 4 — Controlled Dependencies

Dependencies are part of the effective build state.

They MUST therefore be managed as controlled engineering inputs.

Dependency management SHOULD provide:

* explicit declarations;
* understandable version constraints;
* stable resolution;
* reproducibility;
* compatibility management;
* security awareness;
* update governance.

---

## Dependency Principle

A dependency must not be treated as external background state.

Conceptually:

```text
Source
   +
Dependencies
   ↓
Effective Build Input
```

Changes in dependencies may change the resulting artifact even when application source remains unchanged.

---

## Principle 5 — Controlled Toolchain

The build toolchain is an engineering dependency.

The toolchain may include:

* language runtimes;
* package managers;
* package builders;
* compilers;
* code generators;
* validation tools;
* archive utilities;
* documentation generators.

Significant toolchain versions SHOULD be known.

---

## Toolchain Drift Rule

The Build Framework must avoid uncontrolled situations such as:

```text
Developer A → Tool v1
Developer B → Tool v2
CI          → Tool v3
```

where differences materially affect build behavior.

The target model is:

```text
Governed Toolchain Requirements
             ↓
Consistent Build Semantics
```

---

## Principle 6 — Environment Independence

Build behavior SHOULD minimize dependence on machine-specific state.

A FamilyOS build should not require undocumented knowledge about a specific workstation.

Relevant environment assumptions must be:

* explicit;
* documented;
* validated;
* controlled where practical.

---

## Environment Independence Model

The target direction is:

```text
Host Environment
      ↓
Defined Build Requirements
      ↓
Validated Build Context
      ↓
Canonical Build
```

The host may differ physically.

The build semantics must remain stable.

---

## Principle 7 — Configuration Is Code

Build configuration is part of the engineering state.

Significant build configuration SHOULD therefore be:

* version controlled;
* reviewable;
* documented;
* validated;
* traceable.

Configuration must not silently change critical build behavior.

---

## Configuration Rule

The preferred model is:

```text
Versioned Configuration
        ↓
Explicit Resolution
        ↓
Build Execution
```

rather than:

```text
Hidden Defaults
      +
Environment State
      ↓
Implicit Behavior
```

---

## Principle 8 — Build Trust Requires Validation

Successful execution does not establish trust by itself.

A FamilyOS build must distinguish:

```text
Process Completed
```

from:

```text
Artifact Trusted
```

Validation is the mechanism that connects these states.

---

## Validation Principle

The canonical trust progression is:

```text
Input Validation
       ↓
Execution
       ↓
Output Validation
       ↓
Evidence
       ↓
Trust
```

Validation may operate before, during, and after artifact generation.

---

## Principle 9 — Evidence Before Trust

Trusted build outputs SHOULD be supported by evidence.

Evidence may include:

* source revision;
* build identifier;
* configuration;
* dependency state;
* tool versions;
* environment context;
* validation results;
* artifact checksums;
* logs;
* manifests.

The amount of evidence required may vary according to build type and maturity.

---

## Evidence Rule

The preferred model is:

```text
Build Execution
      ↓
Artifact
      +
Evidence
```

not:

```text
Build Execution
      ↓
Artifact
      ↓
Later Guesswork
```

---

## Principle 10 — Artifact Identity

Artifacts SHOULD have explicit identity.

An artifact should not be understood only by its filesystem location.

Artifact identity may include:

* name;
* type;
* version context;
* build identifier;
* source revision;
* checksum;
* metadata.

---

## Artifact Identity Model

```text
Artifact
│
├── Name
├── Type
├── Build Context
├── Integrity
└── Validation State
```

The exact representation may depend on artifact type.

---

## Principle 11 — Traceability By Design

Trusted artifacts SHOULD be traceable to their source and build context.

The intended relationship is:

```text
Artifact
   ↓
Build
   ↓
Inputs
   ↓
Source Revision
```

Traceability must not depend exclusively on human memory.

---

## Traceability Benefits

Traceability supports:

* debugging;
* incident response;
* release verification;
* rollback investigation;
* compliance;
* maintenance;
* reproducibility.

---

## Principle 12 — Local and CI Semantic Alignment

Local and CI builds SHOULD use the same conceptual build model.

The framework must avoid separate build definitions for each execution environment.

The desired model is:

```text
Canonical Build Definition
         │
         ├── Local
         ├── CI
         └── Release Preparation
```

Environment-specific adapters may exist.

The build semantics should remain common.

---

## Principle 13 — Automation Must Not Define Architecture

Automation tools execute build architecture.

They must not silently become the architecture.

The Build Framework rejects the pattern:

```text
CI Configuration
      ↓
Hidden Build Logic
```

The preferred model is:

```text
Build Architecture
       ↓
Canonical Build Definition
       ↓
Automation
```

---

## Principle 14 — Automation With Control

Automation SHOULD reduce repetitive human work while preserving validation and governance.

Automation must not bypass:

* dependency controls;
* configuration rules;
* validation;
* quality gates;
* security boundaries;
* artifact checks.

Automation is a delivery mechanism for build policy.

It is not an exception to build policy.

---

## Principle 15 — Fail Fast When State Is Invalid

Invalid build state SHOULD be rejected as early as practical.

Examples include:

* missing configuration;
* unsupported runtime;
* invalid dependency state;
* absent required input;
* invalid package metadata;
* incompatible toolchain.

The preferred progression is:

```text
Invalid State
     ↓
Early Validation
     ↓
Clear Failure
```

rather than:

```text
Invalid State
     ↓
Long Build
     ↓
Late Failure
```

---

## Principle 16 — Failure Must Be Explainable

Build failures must provide actionable information.

Where practical, failure output should communicate:

* failing stage;
* failure reason;
* relevant context;
* affected input;
* recommended corrective direction.

A build failure without useful information reduces developer productivity and weakens observability.

---

## Failure Transparency Rule

The Build Framework distinguishes between:

```text
Controlled Failure
```

and:

```text
Opaque Failure
```

Controlled failure is part of correct system behavior.

Opaque failure is an engineering defect.

---

## Principle 17 — Observability By Design

Build processes SHOULD expose meaningful operational information.

Relevant information may include:

* start time;
* end time;
* stage progression;
* execution duration;
* artifact list;
* validation results;
* warnings;
* failure category.

Observability must support both humans and automation.

---

## Observability Boundary

Observability must not disclose sensitive information.

Build logs and evidence must avoid leaking:

* credentials;
* tokens;
* private keys;
* secrets;
* protected configuration.

---

## Principle 18 — Security Is Part Of Build Engineering

Build systems are part of the FamilyOS software supply chain.

Security must therefore be considered in:

* dependency acquisition;
* tool execution;
* environment isolation;
* secret management;
* artifact integrity;
* automation permissions;
* provenance.

Build security is not an optional downstream concern.

---

## Principle 19 — Least Privilege

Build processes SHOULD operate with the minimum privileges necessary.

A build should not receive deployment or release permissions merely because they exist elsewhere in the engineering platform.

This supports separation between:

```text
Build
Release
Deployment
Runtime
```

Each capability should receive only the permissions it requires.

---

## Principle 20 — Build and Release Separation

Build completion MUST NOT automatically imply release approval.

The Build Framework answers:

```text
Is this a valid trusted build artifact?
```

The Release Framework answers:

```text
Should this artifact become an official release?
```

These decisions must remain distinct.

---

## Principle 21 — Separation Of Responsibilities

Build responsibilities should remain separated where doing so improves clarity.

A conceptual separation includes:

```text
Input Management
       ↓
Configuration
       ↓
Environment
       ↓
Execution
       ↓
Artifact Management
       ↓
Validation
       ↓
Release Handoff
```

These responsibilities may exist within one implementation, but their conceptual boundaries should remain understandable.

---

## Principle 22 — Build Logic Must Be Maintainable

Build logic should be designed with the same maintainability expectations applied to application code.

Build scripts and automation should avoid:

* unnecessary duplication;
* hidden side effects;
* excessive complexity;
* undocumented assumptions;
* fragile shell behavior;
* unbounded global state.

Build systems are production engineering assets.

---

## Principle 23 — Prefer Declarative State

Where practical, FamilyOS SHOULD prefer declarative descriptions of build requirements over procedural hidden configuration.

Examples include:

* dependency declarations;
* package metadata;
* build profiles;
* artifact definitions;
* tool configuration.

Declarative state improves:

* reviewability;
* reproducibility;
* automation;
* validation;
* governance.

---

## Principle 24 — Single Source Of Build Truth

FamilyOS SHOULD avoid multiple conflicting definitions of the same build behavior.

The target model is:

```text
Canonical Build Definition
         ↓
Multiple Execution Contexts
```

The anti-pattern is:

```text
Local Script
CI Script
Release Script
Developer Notes
```

all encoding different rules.

---

## Principle 25 — Tool Choice Follows Architecture

FamilyOS must not design build architecture around the limitations or preferences of a specific tool.

The correct order is:

```text
Engineering Need
      ↓
Architecture
      ↓
Required Capability
      ↓
Tool Selection
```

not:

```text
Preferred Tool
      ↓
Architecture Shaped Around Tool
```

---

## Principle 26 — Simplicity Over Build Sophistication

Build infrastructure must remain proportional to real engineering needs.

FamilyOS must avoid introducing complex systems solely because they represent industry best practices at a larger scale.

Examples of potentially premature complexity include:

* distributed build systems;
* remote execution clusters;
* sophisticated artifact registries;
* custom build languages;
* large-scale cache infrastructure;
* advanced signing platforms.

These may become appropriate later.

They are not objectives by themselves.

---

## Simplicity Rule

The preferred progression is:

```text
Need
 ↓
Simple Reliable Mechanism
 ↓
Evidence Of Limitation
 ↓
Controlled Evolution
```

---

## Principle 27 — Build Complexity Must Be Visible

When complexity is necessary, it must be explicit.

Complex behavior should not hide inside:

* shell aliases;
* developer machines;
* implicit scripts;
* CI implementation details;
* undocumented environment state.

Complexity that cannot be avoided must be documented and governed.

---

## Principle 28 — Incremental Evolution

The Build Framework must support incremental implementation.

FamilyOS does not need to reach maximum build maturity in a single phase.

A valid progression is:

```text
Manual
  ↓
Documented
  ↓
Standardized
  ↓
Validated
  ↓
Automated
  ↓
Reproducible
  ↓
Traceable
```

Each stage should remain useful independently.

---

## Principle 29 — Backward Compatibility Matters

Changes to build behavior may affect:

* developer workflows;
* CI;
* packaging;
* plugins;
* documentation generation;
* release processes.

Build changes SHOULD therefore consider backward compatibility.

Breaking changes must be explicit and governed.

---

## Principle 30 — Build Interfaces Should Be Stable

The canonical build entry points should evolve more slowly than internal implementation.

This enables FamilyOS to change:

* builders;
* orchestration;
* internal scripts;
* validation tools;

without constantly changing developer workflows.

---

## Stable Interface Model

```text
Stable Build Interface
        ↓
Replaceable Internal Implementation
```

This supports maintainability and evolution.

---

## Principle 31 — Generated Content Must Be Governed

Generated content is part of build engineering when generation occurs during the build lifecycle.

Generated outputs SHOULD have defined rules concerning:

* source;
* generator;
* destination;
* repeatability;
* validation;
* version-control expectations.

Generated content must not become an uncontrolled source of repository drift.

---

## Principle 32 — Build Outputs Must Have Defined Destinations

Artifacts should be produced into known and predictable locations.

The build system should avoid scattering outputs unpredictably across the repository.

Defined output locations improve:

* cleanup;
* automation;
* CI artifact collection;
* debugging;
* release handoff.

---

## Principle 33 — Temporary State Must Be Contained

Temporary build state SHOULD remain isolated from authoritative engineering state.

Examples include:

* caches;
* temporary files;
* intermediate artifacts;
* local build directories.

Temporary outputs must not be confused with trusted artifacts.

---

## Principle 34 — Clean Builds Must Be Possible

FamilyOS SHOULD support rebuilding from a clean state.

A clean build capability helps reveal hidden dependencies on:

* stale outputs;
* local caches;
* generated files;
* prior executions.

Conceptually:

```text
Clean State
    ↓
Canonical Inputs
    ↓
Build
    ↓
Valid Artifact
```

---

## Principle 35 — Incremental Builds Must Not Change Semantics

Incremental build optimization may be introduced where useful.

However:

```text
Clean Build Semantics
        =
Incremental Build Semantics
```

The optimization may reduce execution work.

It must not change expected outcomes.

---

## Principle 36 — Caching Must Be Safe

Caching may improve build performance.

Cache reuse must not compromise correctness or reproducibility.

A cache entry should only be reused when its validity conditions are satisfied.

The principle is:

```text
Correctness
   >
Cache Hit Rate
```

---

## Principle 37 — Performance Follows Correctness

Build performance matters, but optimization must not precede trust.

The priority order is:

```text
Correctness
    ↓
Reliability
    ↓
Reproducibility
    ↓
Validation
    ↓
Observability
    ↓
Performance
```

This prevents fast but unreliable build systems.

---

## Principle 38 — Build Evidence Must Be Proportional

Not every local developer build requires the same evidence as a release candidate build.

Evidence requirements may vary according to build profile.

For example:

```text
Development Build
      ↓
Basic Evidence

CI Build
      ↓
Standard Evidence

Release Candidate
      ↓
Strong Evidence
```

The model must remain proportional to risk and purpose.

---

## Principle 39 — Build Profiles Must Be Explicit

Different build modes may exist.

Examples include:

* development;
* validation;
* CI;
* documentation;
* plugin;
* release candidate.

Profiles SHOULD define:

* purpose;
* inputs;
* active configuration;
* validations;
* artifact expectations.

Profiles must not become hidden collections of environment-specific behavior.

---

## Principle 40 — Build Context Must Be Inspectable

A build should make its effective context understandable.

Where appropriate, engineers should be able to determine:

* source revision;
* profile;
* runtime;
* dependencies;
* relevant configuration;
* toolchain.

This improves diagnosis and trust.

---

## Principle 41 — Idempotence Where Practical

Repeated execution of the same build operation SHOULD avoid creating uncontrolled cumulative side effects.

A build should not silently alter authoritative source state unless generation behavior explicitly requires it.

Where build operations mutate state, that behavior must be deliberate and documented.

---

## Principle 42 — Build Operations Must Respect Repository Boundaries

The Build Framework must not introduce uncontrolled changes to unrelated repository areas.

Build output locations and generated files should be predictable.

Build operations should remain scoped to their defined responsibilities.

---

## Principle 43 — Build Documentation Is Part Of The System

Important build behavior MUST be documented.

Documentation should explain:

* prerequisites;
* canonical commands;
* build stages;
* configuration;
* artifacts;
* validation;
* common failures.

Build knowledge must not reside only in source code or contributor memory.

---

## Principle 44 — Governance Is Proportional

Not every build change requires an ADR or RFC.

Governance should remain proportional to architectural impact.

A useful model is:

```text
Small Internal Change
        ↓
Review

Significant Build Behavior Change
        ↓
Technical Review

Architectural Change
        ↓
ADR

Cross-Platform Strategic Change
        ↓
RFC / EPIC Evolution
```

---

## Principle 45 — Architectural Changes Must Be Explicit

Changes that materially affect:

* build boundaries;
* artifact contracts;
* build lifecycle;
* dependency model;
* toolchain model;
* release handoff;

must not occur accidentally.

They require explicit architectural consideration.

---

## Principle 46 — Build Standards Apply Across FamilyOS

The Build Framework establishes common standards for the complete FamilyOS engineering ecosystem.

Individual components may require specialized implementations.

They should not redefine fundamental principles independently.

---

## Principle 47 — Plugin Builds Must Respect Platform Rules

Official plugin build processes must remain compatible with:

* FamilyOS build principles;
* plugin architecture;
* plugin compliance rules;
* artifact validation;
* release requirements.

Plugins may extend the build model but must not bypass its trust requirements.

---

## Principle 48 — Build Systems Must Support Future Artifact Types

The framework must not assume that Python packages will remain the only important artifacts.

Future artifacts may include:

* schemas;
* generated documentation;
* plugin bundles;
* metadata packages;
* service packages;
* configuration bundles.

Build architecture should therefore define stable concepts rather than format-specific assumptions.

---

## Principle 49 — Supply Chain Assurance Evolves Incrementally

The Build Framework should support future mechanisms such as:

* signed artifacts;
* provenance attestations;
* dependency verification;
* isolated builders;
* policy enforcement.

However, these capabilities should be introduced only when engineering maturity justifies them.

---

## Principle 50 — Trust Must Be Explainable

The final principle combines all previous requirements.

FamilyOS should be able to explain why a trusted artifact is trusted.

That explanation should eventually connect:

```text
Artifact
   ↓
Validation
   ↓
Build
   ↓
Configuration
   ↓
Toolchain
   ↓
Dependencies
   ↓
Source
```

Trust without explainability is insufficient for a governed engineering platform.

---

## Principle Interaction

The principles reinforce one another.

For example:

```text
Explicit Inputs
      ↓
Reproducibility
      ↓
Traceability
      ↓
Validation
      ↓
Evidence
      ↓
Trust
```

Similarly:

```text
Simplicity
    +
Modularity
    +
Observability
      ↓
Maintainability
```

And:

```text
Controlled Dependencies
       +
Controlled Toolchain
       +
Controlled Environment
       ↓
Supply Chain Confidence
```

---

## Principle Conflict Resolution

Build principles may occasionally conflict.

For example:

* reproducibility may reduce performance;
* simplicity may limit advanced optimization;
* security may increase build complexity;
* strong evidence may increase execution time.

When principles conflict, decisions should prioritize:

```text
Correctness
    ↓
Security
    ↓
Trust
    ↓
Maintainability
    ↓
Developer Experience
    ↓
Performance
```

This order is a guideline rather than an absolute mechanical rule.

Architectural judgment remains necessary.

---

## Decision Evaluation Model

A proposed build change should be evaluated using questions such as:

```text
Does it improve or weaken reproducibility?

Does it introduce hidden inputs?

Does it preserve local and CI consistency?

Does it affect artifact identity?

Does it change trust requirements?

Does it introduce unnecessary complexity?

Can the behavior be observed and diagnosed?

Does it preserve security boundaries?

Does it require governance?
```

This model provides practical application of the principles.

---

## Compliance Expectations

Build implementations SHOULD be evaluated against the principles in this document.

A build capability that repeatedly violates core principles may require:

* remediation;
* architectural review;
* documented exception;
* technical debt tracking.

Not every principle must be implemented at maximum maturity immediately.

However, deliberate contradiction of foundational principles requires explicit justification.

---

## Non-Negotiable Principles

The following principles are considered foundational and MUST NOT be bypassed without formal architectural justification:

1. significant build inputs must not remain intentionally hidden;
2. dependency state must be governable;
3. trusted artifacts must be validated;
4. build and release authority must remain separated;
5. critical build behavior must not exist exclusively as undocumented local knowledge;
6. significant build failures must be diagnosable;
7. security boundaries must not be weakened for convenience;
8. architectural build changes must be explicit;
9. automation must not bypass validation;
10. trusted artifact origin must progressively become traceable.

---

## Build Principle Summary

The FamilyOS Build Framework can be summarized through the following equation:

```text
Build Trust =
    Explicit Inputs
  + Controlled Dependencies
  + Controlled Toolchain
  + Controlled Configuration
  + Controlled Environment
  + Predictable Execution
  + Validation
  + Artifact Identity
  + Traceability
  + Evidence
  + Governance
```

No individual mechanism creates build trust alone.

Trust emerges from the complete engineering system.

---

## Final Principle

The FamilyOS Build Framework is founded on the following final rule:

> Build systems must reduce uncertainty, not merely automate transformation.

Every design decision within EPIC-BLD-001 should therefore move FamilyOS toward build behavior that is more explicit, more predictable, more reproducible, more traceable, more observable, and easier to trust.

These principles establish the permanent engineering foundation upon which the FamilyOS Build Framework is built.
