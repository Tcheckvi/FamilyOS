# Build Framework

## 09 Build Environment Management

### Overview

EPIC-BLD-001 — Build Framework defines how FamilyOS build environments are identified, prepared, validated, isolated, maintained, and governed.

A build environment is the execution context in which build tooling transforms controlled engineering inputs into artifacts.

The environment includes more than the operating system.

It may include:

* runtime versions;
* installed build tooling;
* dependency state;
* filesystem layout;
* environment variables;
* permissions;
* network conditions;
* architecture;
* locale;
* available system utilities;
* isolation mechanisms;
* automation context.

The purpose of this document is to ensure that FamilyOS build behavior does not depend unpredictably on machine-specific or undocumented environment state.

The central principle is:

> A build environment does not need to be identical everywhere, but every difference capable of influencing build trust must be understood and controlled.

---

## Purpose

The Build Environment Management model establishes the engineering expectations required to make build execution predictable across:

* developer workstations;
* virtual environments;
* CI runners;
* future containerized environments;
* future dedicated build workers;
* release-candidate execution environments.

The framework defines how build environments participate in:

* reproducibility;
* determinism;
* security;
* validation;
* observability;
* local and CI consistency;
* artifact trust.

---

## Environment Definition

A build environment is the effective runtime context in which a build executes.

Conceptually:

```text
Build Environment
│
├── Operating System
├── Hardware Architecture
├── Runtime
├── Toolchain
├── Installed Dependencies
├── Filesystem
├── Environment Variables
├── Permissions
├── Network Context
├── Locale
└── Automation Context
```

Not every dimension is relevant to every build.

Relevant dimensions must nevertheless remain identifiable.

---

## Environment As Build Context

The environment is part of the effective build context.

The build relationship is:

```text
Source
   +
Configuration
   +
Dependencies
   +
Toolchain
   +
Environment
   ↓
Build Result
```

Two otherwise equivalent builds may behave differently if the environment differs in material ways.

Environment management therefore contributes directly to reproducibility.

---

## Environment Objectives

FamilyOS build environments should be:

* predictable;
* documented;
* reproducible enough for their purpose;
* validated;
* isolated where useful;
* compatible with canonical tooling;
* automation-friendly;
* secure;
* observable;
* easy to maintain.

---

## Environment Principle 1 — Environment Assumptions Must Be Explicit

A canonical build must not depend on undocumented environment assumptions.

Examples of assumptions that may require explicit representation include:

* supported Python version;
* required operating system capabilities;
* expected virtual environment;
* required system utility;
* network availability;
* required environment variable.

Unknown assumptions produce fragile builds.

---

## Environment Principle 2 — Environment Differences Must Be Controlled

FamilyOS does not require every developer and CI runner to use an identical physical machine.

The requirement is semantic consistency.

The target is:

```text
Different Physical Environments
            ↓
Controlled Build Requirements
            ↓
Equivalent Build Semantics
```

---

## Environment Principle 3 — Unsupported Environments Must Fail Explicitly

An unsupported environment must not silently continue.

The preferred model is:

```text
Detect Environment
      ↓
Validate Requirements
      ↓
Supported?
  ┌───┴───┐
 Yes      No
  ↓        ↓
Build     Fail Clearly
```

This prevents undefined behavior.

---

## Environment Principle 4 — Local And CI Environments Must Remain Comparable

Developer and CI environments may differ in implementation.

They should not differ unpredictably in build semantics.

The target relationship is:

```text
Canonical Environment Requirements
              │
              ├── Local
              └── CI
```

---

## Environment Principle 5 — Isolation Should Reduce Hidden State

Environment isolation can reduce contamination from unrelated software.

Possible mechanisms include:

* Python virtual environments;
* containers;
* dedicated runners;
* ephemeral CI environments.

The framework does not mandate one universal mechanism.

Isolation should be introduced where it improves reliability or security.

---

## Environment Principle 6 — Environment State Must Not Become Authoritative Engineering State

Installed packages, caches, shell configuration, and host-specific files are not authoritative substitutes for repository definitions.

For example:

```text
Installed Dependency State
        ≠
Dependency Declaration
```

The environment realizes the build configuration.

It must not replace it.

---

## Environment Categories

FamilyOS recognizes several conceptual environment categories.

```text
Build Environments
│
├── Development Environment
├── Validation Environment
├── CI Environment
├── Release Candidate Environment
└── Future Controlled Builder
```

These environments may share most of their tooling while applying different levels of control.

---

## Development Environment

The development environment supports everyday engineering work.

Its priorities include:

* accessibility;
* rapid feedback;
* local execution;
* debugging;
* canonical tool compatibility.

Development environments may allow more flexibility than release-candidate environments.

---

## Development Environment Requirements

A development environment SHOULD provide:

* supported runtime;
* declared dependencies;
* required validation tools;
* canonical build tools;
* project configuration;
* practical local isolation.

Local flexibility must not become hidden canonical behavior.

---

## Virtual Environments

For Python development, virtual environments provide practical dependency and tool isolation.

A virtual environment helps separate:

```text
Project Dependencies
```

from:

```text
Global Python Environment
```

This reduces accidental dependence on globally installed packages.

---

## Virtual Environment Requirements

Virtual environments SHOULD:

* be reproducible from dependency definitions;
* remain disposable;
* not be committed as authoritative project state;
* not become the only record of installed dependencies.

A fresh virtual environment should be able to reconstruct a valid development environment.

---

## Validation Environment

A validation environment is optimized for engineering verification.

It may execute:

* linting;
* type checking;
* tests;
* packaging validation;
* artifact checks;
* documentation validation.

The validation environment may be local or automated.

---

## Validation Environment Objective

The objective is to answer:

```text
Can the current engineering state satisfy required validation under a controlled environment?
```

This environment may apply stricter controls than routine development.

---

## CI Environment

CI provides an independently provisioned execution context.

A CI environment should ideally begin from a relatively clean state.

The canonical model is:

```text
Repository Revision
      ↓
Fresh CI Environment
      ↓
Declared Dependencies
      ↓
Declared Toolchain
      ↓
Canonical Build
```

This helps expose hidden local dependencies.

---

## CI Environment Requirements

CI environments SHOULD provide:

* known runtime;
* known dependency installation process;
* known toolchain;
* known repository revision;
* canonical configuration;
* controlled secrets;
* predictable artifact collection.

---

## Ephemeral CI Environments

Ephemeral CI runners provide an important property:

```text
No Reliance On Previous Local Build State
```

This makes CI useful as a reproducibility signal.

However, CI alone does not guarantee reproducibility if dependencies or external inputs remain uncontrolled.

---

## Release Candidate Environment

Release-candidate builds may require the strongest environment controls.

Possible requirements include:

* canonical runtime version;
* controlled dependency set;
* validated toolchain;
* known repository revision;
* clean build workspace;
* stricter network policy;
* stronger evidence;
* restricted credentials.

---

## Release Environment Principle

A release-candidate environment should minimize unnecessary variability.

The target is:

```text
Controlled Source
      +
Controlled Environment
      ↓
Trusted Release Candidate Artifact
```

---

## Future Controlled Build Environment

FamilyOS may eventually introduce more strongly controlled builders.

Possible technologies include:

* containers;
* immutable images;
* isolated runners;
* dedicated build services.

These are future implementation options.

They are not required for initial Build Framework maturity.

---

## Operating System Context

Operating system behavior may influence builds through:

* path semantics;
* filesystem behavior;
* executable availability;
* permissions;
* archive behavior;
* platform-specific dependencies.

If multiple operating systems are supported, their build semantics must be intentionally validated.

---

## Platform Compatibility

The framework should distinguish:

```text
Supported Development Platform
```

from:

```text
Canonical Artifact Build Platform
```

These may eventually differ.

The distinction should be explicit.

---

## Hardware Architecture

Hardware architecture may affect:

* binary artifacts;
* native dependencies;
* performance;
* platform compatibility.

For pure Python artifacts, architecture may have limited influence.

Future components may require explicit architecture-aware build profiles.

---

## Runtime Environment

The runtime environment is a critical build dimension.

For current FamilyOS development, Python version is particularly important.

Runtime management should define:

* supported versions;
* canonical build version where needed;
* compatibility expectations;
* validation behavior.

---

## Runtime Validation

Before canonical execution, the environment SHOULD verify runtime compatibility.

For example:

```text
Required Runtime
      ↓
Detected Runtime
      ↓
Compare
      ↓
Proceed / Fail
```

---

## Dependency Environment

Installed dependency state must correspond to declared project requirements.

The environment must avoid situations where the build succeeds only because an undeclared dependency happens to be installed.

---

## Dependency Environment Validation

Useful checks may include:

* required package presence;
* dependency compatibility;
* lock-state conformance;
* environment isolation.

The exact implementation may vary by build profile.

---

## Toolchain Environment

Required build tools must be available within the environment.

Examples include:

* package builder;
* Ruff;
* MyPy;
* Pytest;
* generators;
* artifact validators.

Missing tools should fail before dependent stages begin.

---

## Filesystem Environment

The filesystem provides:

* source access;
* temporary workspace;
* output directories;
* cache directories;
* artifact destinations.

Filesystem assumptions must be portable where practical.

---

## Filesystem Requirements

Builds should avoid depending on:

* user-specific absolute paths;
* manually created directories;
* stale generated files;
* uncontrolled files outside the project.

Paths should normally resolve from controlled roots.

---

## Filesystem Permissions

The environment must have sufficient permissions to perform required operations.

It should not require excessive privileges.

The principle is:

```text
Minimum Required Permissions
```

rather than:

```text
Maximum Available Permissions
```

---

## Temporary Storage

Build operations may require temporary storage.

Temporary state should be:

* isolated;
* disposable;
* predictable;
* excluded from trusted artifact identity unless intentional.

Temporary paths should not influence artifact output unnecessarily.

---

## Environment Variables

Environment variables can affect build behavior.

They may provide:

* CI metadata;
* profile selection;
* controlled overrides;
* credentials;
* environment-specific settings.

Their use must remain explicit.

---

## Environment Variable Categories

Environment variables may be classified as:

```text
Configuration Variables
Context Variables
Secret Variables
Infrastructure Variables
```

Different categories require different handling.

---

## Configuration Variables

Configuration variables influence build behavior.

Where they materially affect trusted output, their values or effective state should become part of the build context.

---

## Context Variables

Context variables may expose information such as:

* CI job identifier;
* repository metadata;
* workspace location.

They may support observability without changing artifact semantics.

---

## Secret Variables

Secret variables require strict handling.

They MUST NOT:

* be printed in logs;
* be embedded unintentionally in artifacts;
* be stored as ordinary build evidence.

---

## Infrastructure Variables

Infrastructure variables may describe:

* runner identity;
* temporary directories;
* provider-specific paths.

The build should avoid letting provider-specific details alter canonical semantics.

---

## Locale

Locale can affect:

* sorting;
* encoding;
* formatting;
* command output;
* generated documentation.

Where locale materially affects output, it should be controlled.

---

## Timezone

Timezone may influence:

* timestamps;
* generated metadata;
* documentation output;
* logs.

Canonical artifact generation should avoid uncontrolled timezone-dependent output where feasible.

---

## Clock And Time

Build systems often introduce timestamps.

Timestamps can reduce determinism.

The framework should distinguish between:

* operational timestamps;
* artifact-semantic timestamps.

Operational timestamps are useful evidence.

Artifact timestamps should be controlled if they affect reproducibility.

---

## Network Environment

Network access may be required for:

* dependency acquisition;
* external metadata;
* remote services;
* artifact retrieval.

Network dependency introduces mutable external state.

---

## Network Principle

A build should not rely on unrestricted network access unless required.

The target progression is:

```text
Network Requirement
      ↓
Explicit Purpose
      ↓
Controlled Access
```

---

## Offline Build Capability

FamilyOS may eventually support stronger offline or partially offline builds.

This can improve:

* reproducibility;
* resilience;
* supply-chain control.

It is a maturity objective rather than an immediate universal requirement.

---

## Proxy And Corporate Network Considerations

Different developer environments may operate behind proxies or restricted networks.

Build architecture should keep network configuration separate from canonical artifact semantics wherever possible.

---

## Environment Discovery

Before execution, the build system may discover relevant environment properties.

A future environment report could expose:

```text
Operating System
Architecture
Python Version
Virtual Environment
Build Tool Versions
Relevant Configuration
```

This improves diagnostics.

---

## Environment Validation Flow

The canonical validation flow is:

```text
Discover Environment
      ↓
Resolve Required Environment
      ↓
Compare
      ↓
Validate
      ↓
Build-Ready Environment
```

---

## Environment Requirements Contract

A build target may conceptually define an environment contract.

```text
BuildEnvironmentContract
│
├── Supported Runtime
├── Required Tools
├── Required Dependencies
├── Required Variables
├── Filesystem Requirements
├── Network Requirements
└── Permission Requirements
```

The contract may initially exist in documentation and configuration rather than as a formal object.

---

## Environment Profiles

Different build profiles may impose different requirements.

---

## Development Environment Profile

A development profile may allow:

* flexible working tree;
* local caches;
* broad network access;
* standard evidence.

It must still use supported runtime and tooling.

---

## CI Environment Profile

A CI profile may require:

* fresh environment;
* explicit dependency installation;
* canonical build commands;
* isolated secrets;
* standard evidence.

---

## Release Candidate Environment Profile

A release candidate may require:

* clean workspace;
* controlled dependency state;
* canonical toolchain;
* explicit source revision;
* strong evidence;
* restricted permissions.

---

## Plugin Build Environment

Plugin builds should reuse canonical FamilyOS environment requirements.

Plugin-specific build needs should be declared rather than assumed.

---

## Documentation Build Environment

Documentation generation may require additional tools.

Those tools must participate in the same environment validation principles.

---

## Environment Reproducibility

Environment reproducibility can exist at several levels.

```text
Level 1
Documented Requirements

Level 2
Reconstructable Environment

Level 3
Version-Controlled Environment Definition

Level 4
Automated Provisioning

Level 5
Immutable Build Environment
```

FamilyOS can progress through these levels incrementally.

---

## Environment Definition

A reproducible environment should derive from explicit definitions rather than manual installation history.

Conceptually:

```text
Environment Definition
        ↓
Provision
        ↓
Validated Environment
```

---

## Environment Provisioning

Provisioning may include:

* runtime installation;
* virtual environment creation;
* dependency installation;
* tool installation;
* configuration injection.

Provisioning should be repeatable.

---

## Provisioning And Build Separation

Environment provisioning and build execution are related but distinct.

The preferred model is:

```text
Provision Environment
       ↓
Validate Environment
       ↓
Execute Build
```

This separation improves diagnosis.

---

## Environment Drift

Environment drift occurs when actual environment state diverges from documented or declared requirements.

Examples include:

* different runtime version;
* undeclared installed package;
* outdated tool;
* missing tool;
* changed environment variable.

Drift should be detected where it materially affects build trust.

---

## Local Drift

Developer environments naturally accumulate state.

The framework should reduce the impact of this through:

* virtual environments;
* environment validation;
* clean build capability;
* canonical dependency declarations.

---

## CI Drift

CI drift may occur through changes in:

* runner images;
* preinstalled tools;
* default operating system;
* action versions;
* platform configuration.

CI dependencies must therefore be explicit enough to remain reviewable.

---

## Environment Isolation

Isolation reduces accidental interaction between build and host state.

Isolation may include:

* virtual environments;
* containers;
* dedicated users;
* restricted filesystem access;
* dedicated runners.

Isolation strength should remain proportional to risk.

---

## Isolation And Reproducibility

Isolation improves reproducibility by shrinking the amount of uncontrolled state.

```text
Large Host State
      ↓
Isolation Boundary
      ↓
Smaller Effective Build State
```

---

## Isolation And Security

Isolation also reduces the security impact of compromised tooling or dependencies.

Future stronger builds may use additional sandboxing.

This should be introduced when justified by risk.

---

## Clean Environment Principle

A canonical build SHOULD be reproducible from a clean environment.

The preferred test is:

```text
Fresh Environment
      ↓
Declared Setup
      ↓
Canonical Build
      ↓
Valid Artifact
```

If the build only succeeds after historical local state accumulates, environment control is insufficient.

---

## Environment Cleanup

Local or automated environments may require cleanup.

Cleanup can remove:

* temporary directories;
* build output;
* caches;
* ephemeral configuration.

Cleanup must not remove authoritative definitions.

---

## Cache Management

Caches can improve environment performance.

Examples include:

* dependency download caches;
* package build caches;
* test caches.

Caches must remain optional optimizations.

---

## Cache Principle

The build should remain correct when the cache is absent.

```text
Cache Present → Faster

Cache Missing → Still Correct
```

---

## Environment State Recording

For significant builds, relevant environment information may become build evidence.

Examples include:

* OS;
* architecture;
* runtime version;
* toolchain versions;
* selected profile.

Evidence should not include secrets.

---

## Environment Fingerprinting

Future FamilyOS builds may use environment fingerprints.

A conceptual fingerprint might represent:

```text
Runtime
Toolchain
Dependency State
Platform
```

This could support reproducibility and cache correctness.

It is not required immediately.

---

## Environment Observability

Environment-related failures should be easy to diagnose.

A useful diagnostic should explain:

* detected environment;
* expected environment;
* failing requirement;
* corrective direction.

---

## Environment Failure Categories

Possible conceptual categories include:

```text
UNSUPPORTED_RUNTIME
MISSING_TOOL
INVALID_DEPENDENCY_ENVIRONMENT
MISSING_CONFIGURATION
UNSUPPORTED_PLATFORM
INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSION
NETWORK_REQUIREMENT_UNAVAILABLE
INVALID_SECRET_CONFIGURATION
```

Machine-readable codes may be introduced later.

---

## Environment Security

Build environments interact with untrusted or semi-trusted inputs such as dependencies and generated code.

Security considerations include:

* least privilege;
* secret isolation;
* controlled network access;
* trusted tool acquisition;
* dependency integrity;
* artifact integrity.

---

## Secret Isolation

Secrets should only be exposed to build stages that require them.

Most ordinary build stages should require no secrets.

For example:

```text
Compile / Package
      ↓
No Publication Credential Required
```

Release publication credentials belong downstream.

---

## Environment Permissions

Build processes should not run with administrator or root privileges unless clearly required.

Excessive privileges increase supply-chain risk.

---

## Environment And Artifact Integrity

A compromised or uncontrolled environment can affect artifact integrity.

Therefore environment trust contributes to artifact trust.

```text
Environment Trust
       +
Input Trust
       +
Execution Validation
       ↓
Artifact Trust
```

---

## Environment And Build Evidence

The build evidence model may reference:

* environment profile;
* runtime version;
* toolchain;
* platform;
* CI identity;
* environment fingerprint.

This supports later investigation.

---

## Environment And Release

The Release Framework may impose stronger environment requirements for official artifact production.

The Build Framework should support these requirements without embedding release authority into build execution.

---

## Environment And Testing

The Testing Framework may require specific test environments.

The Build Framework ensures those requirements can be provisioned and validated when tests participate in build readiness.

---

## Environment And Quality

Environment consistency may become a measurable quality concern.

Potential indicators include:

* CI/local divergence;
* environment-related failure rate;
* unsupported runtime usage;
* reproducibility failures.

The Quality Framework governs formal metric use.

---

## Environment And Documentation

Environment setup must be documented sufficiently for engineers to reconstruct supported workflows.

Documentation should explain:

* required runtime;
* environment creation;
* dependency installation;
* validation;
* common failures.

---

## Environment Automation

Environment provisioning should become increasingly automated as the platform matures.

The progression may be:

```text
Manual Setup
    ↓
Documented Setup
    ↓
Scripted Setup
    ↓
Automated Provisioning
    ↓
Declarative Environment
```

Automation should preserve transparency.

---

## Environment Portability

The build environment should avoid unnecessary dependence on a specific workstation or automation provider.

Portable requirements improve:

* developer onboarding;
* CI migration;
* reproducibility;
* long-term maintainability.

---

## Provider Independence

CI provider-specific mechanisms should remain at the integration boundary.

The canonical build environment model should not depend entirely on one vendor's runner semantics.

---

## Containerization

Containers may eventually provide stronger environment reproducibility.

Potential benefits include:

* defined runtime;
* defined system dependencies;
* portable CI execution;
* isolation.

Potential costs include:

* maintenance;
* image complexity;
* security patching;
* local developer overhead.

Containers should be introduced only when they solve actual FamilyOS needs.

---

## Immutable Environments

Future high-trust builds may use immutable environment definitions.

This could reduce drift.

However, immutability is a maturity mechanism, not a prerequisite for a well-designed Build Framework.

---

## Environment Governance

Significant environment changes may require architectural review.

Examples include:

* changing canonical runtime;
* dropping an operating system;
* introducing containerized builds;
* requiring network isolation;
* introducing dedicated build workers;
* changing secret architecture.

---

## Runtime Upgrade Governance

Runtime upgrades deserve particular care.

A runtime change may affect:

* package compatibility;
* tests;
* static analysis;
* build artifacts;
* release support.

Such upgrades should be validated across the engineering platform.

---

## Environment Technical Debt

Environment debt includes:

* undocumented setup steps;
* legacy runtime versions;
* obsolete CI images;
* hidden system dependencies;
* manually installed tools;
* unused environment variables;
* privileged build processes.

This debt should be reduced continuously.

---

## Environment Anti-Pattern — Works Only On One Machine

The framework explicitly rejects:

```text
"It works on my machine."
```

as sufficient build evidence.

The build must be reproducible from documented requirements.

---

## Environment Anti-Pattern — Global Dependency Reliance

The build must not depend on globally installed packages that are absent from declared environment requirements.

---

## Environment Anti-Pattern — CI Magic

Build success must not depend on undocumented software preinstalled on a CI runner.

Required environment state must be explicit.

---

## Environment Anti-Pattern — Secret-Coupled Build

Ordinary packaging should not require production or release secrets.

This weakens isolation and separation of duties.

---

## Environment Anti-Pattern — Environment-Specific Build Logic

Avoid logic such as:

```text
if developer-machine:
    behavior A

if CI:
    behavior B
```

when both are supposed to represent the same build profile.

Execution adapters may differ.

Canonical semantics should not.

---

## Environment Anti-Pattern — Unbounded Environment Variables

Critical build behavior must not be distributed across dozens of undocumented environment variables.

Configuration should remain structured and inspectable.

---

## Environment Success Criteria

The Build Environment Management model is successful when FamilyOS can answer:

1. which environments are supported;
2. which runtime versions are required;
3. how dependencies are provisioned;
4. how tooling is installed;
5. which environment assumptions affect the build;
6. whether a fresh environment can reproduce the build;
7. whether local and CI environments implement equivalent semantics;
8. how unsupported environments fail;
9. which environment details are captured as evidence;
10. how secrets are isolated;
11. whether build permissions are appropriately restricted;
12. how environment drift is detected and corrected.

---

## Environment Invariants

The following invariants should remain true.

### Invariant 1

Canonical build requirements must not depend on undocumented machine state.

### Invariant 2

Unsupported runtime or toolchain state must fail explicitly.

### Invariant 3

Declared dependencies remain authoritative over historical installed state.

### Invariant 4

Local and CI builds must use compatible environment semantics.

### Invariant 5

Caches must not become mandatory hidden inputs.

### Invariant 6

Secrets must not become ordinary build configuration.

### Invariant 7

Build environments must use only necessary privileges.

### Invariant 8

Release credentials must remain separated from ordinary build execution.

### Invariant 9

A clean environment must be capable of reconstructing the canonical build context.

### Invariant 10

Material environment differences must remain explainable.

---

## Environment Maturity Model

FamilyOS build environment maturity may evolve through:

```text
Level 1
Documented Environment

    ↓

Level 2
Isolated Development Environment

    ↓

Level 3
Validated Environment

    ↓

Level 4
Automated Provisioning

    ↓

Level 5
Reproducible Environment Definition

    ↓

Level 6
Immutable Or Strongly Controlled Builder

    ↓

Level 7
Environment Provenance
```

Each level should be adopted only when it provides useful engineering value.

---

## Environment Model Summary

The canonical Build Environment Management flow is:

```text
Define Requirements
       ↓
Provision Environment
       ↓
Discover State
       ↓
Validate State
       ↓
Execute Build
       ↓
Capture Relevant Evidence
       ↓
Clean / Retain As Required
```

This transforms the environment from an implicit background condition into a managed part of FamilyOS build engineering.

---

## Final Principle

The FamilyOS Build Environment Management model is founded on the following rule:

> A trusted build must not depend on an environment that FamilyOS cannot describe, reconstruct, validate, or explain.

Environment control does not require identical machines.

It requires controlled semantics.

The purpose of environment management is therefore to reduce accidental variability until the execution context becomes a predictable and governable part of the build system.
