# Build Framework

## 20 Validation

### Overview

EPIC-BLD-001 — Build Framework requires formal validation of the framework itself before it can be considered complete, stable, and ready to serve as the normative foundation for FamilyOS build engineering.

This document defines how EPIC-BLD-001 is validated as a framework.

It is distinct from `15-Build-Validation.md`.

`15-Build-Validation.md` defines how individual FamilyOS builds and artifacts are validated during engineering execution.

This document defines how the **Build Framework documentation, architecture, governance model, lifecycle, and cross-framework consistency** are validated.

The central principle is:

> The Build Framework must itself satisfy the same expectations of clarity, traceability, consistency, and evidence that it establishes for FamilyOS builds.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of framework validation is to determine whether EPIC-BLD-001 is sufficiently complete and internally coherent to become an authoritative FamilyOS engineering framework.

Validation covers:

* documentation completeness;
* structural consistency;
* architectural coherence;
* terminology;
* framework boundaries;
* lifecycle completeness;
* artifact model completeness;
* validation model completeness;
* governance completeness;
* automation readiness;
* release integration;
* cross-framework consistency;
* implementation readiness;
* control-document synchronization.

---

## Validation Scope

Framework validation applies to the complete EPIC-BLD-001 documentation set.

The normative chapters are:

```text
00-EPIC.md
01-Context.md
02-Vision.md
03-Build-Principles.md
04-Build-Architecture.md
05-Build-Lifecycle.md
06-Build-Input-Requirements.md
07-Build-Inputs-and-Project-Structure.md
08-Build-Toolchain.md
09-Build-Environment-Management.md
10-Dependency-Management.md
11-Build-Configuration.md
12-Build-Philosophy.md
13-Build-Execution.md
14-Artifact-Management.md
15-Build-Validation.md
16-Build-Governance.md
17-Build-Automation-and-CI.md
18-Roadmap.md
19-References.md
20-Validation.md
21-Summary.md
22-Release.md
23-Implementation-Checklist.md
```

Framework control documents include:

```text
EPIC-BLD-001.md
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

Temporary migration files are not part of the final normative framework and must be removed before final closure.

---

## Validation Objectives

The framework validation process must establish that:

1. all required documents exist;
2. document numbering is consistent;
3. document names match their actual content;
4. no obsolete inherited structure remains;
5. the Build Framework has a clear architectural boundary;
6. Build and Release responsibilities remain separated;
7. Testing and Quality responsibilities are not duplicated;
8. build inputs are explicitly modeled;
9. build environments are explicitly modeled;
10. dependencies are explicitly governed;
11. build configuration is explicitly governed;
12. execution semantics are defined;
13. artifacts are explicitly modeled;
14. build validation is defined;
15. automation and CI integration are defined;
16. governance responsibilities are defined;
17. framework evolution is defined;
18. release handoff is defined;
19. the implementation checklist maps to framework requirements;
20. control documents represent the same framework state.

---

## Validation Model

Framework validation is organized into several domains.

```text
Framework Validation
│
├── Structural Validation
├── Documentation Validation
├── Architectural Validation
├── Lifecycle Validation
├── Build Model Validation
├── Artifact Model Validation
├── Integration Validation
├── Governance Validation
├── Automation Validation
├── Release Boundary Validation
├── Traceability Validation
└── Control Document Validation
```

A failure in a required domain prevents final framework closure.

---

## Validation Principle 1 — Structure Before Content

The framework structure must be stable before final content validation.

A structurally inconsistent EPIC creates ambiguity even if individual documents are well written.

The expected sequence is:

```text
Structure
   ↓
Content
   ↓
Cross-References
   ↓
Control Documents
   ↓
Final Validation
```

---

## Validation Principle 2 — Names Must Match Responsibilities

Document names must reflect their actual content.

For example:

```text
04-Build-Architecture.md
```

must define Build Architecture rather than inherited repository architecture.

Similarly:

```text
15-Build-Validation.md
```

must define build validation rather than generic quality philosophy.

This prevents semantic drift.

---

## Validation Principle 3 — No Hidden Duplicate Ownership

The Build Framework must not redefine responsibilities already owned by other frameworks.

Validation must specifically verify boundaries with:

* EPIC-ENG-001;
* EPIC-TST-001;
* EPIC-QLT-001;
* EPIC-DOC-001;
* EPIC-PLUGIN-002;
* EPIC-REL-001.

---

## Validation Principle 4 — Concepts Must Be Consistent Across Chapters

Core terms must retain stable meaning throughout the framework.

Examples include:

* Build Context;
* Build Profile;
* Build ID;
* Candidate Artifact;
* Trusted Artifact;
* Build Evidence;
* Release Handoff.

Terminology drift is a framework defect.

---

## Validation Principle 5 — Strategic And Immediate Requirements Must Be Distinguishable

Future maturity capabilities must not accidentally appear as mandatory immediate implementation requirements.

The framework must distinguish between:

```text
Current Requirement
```

and:

```text
Future Maturity Capability
```

Examples of future capabilities may include:

* formal provenance attestations;
* artifact signing;
* remote builders;
* SBOM generation;
* immutable environments.

---

## Structural Validation

Structural validation verifies the physical organization of EPIC-BLD-001.

---

## Required Numbered Documents

The final structure must contain exactly one canonical document for each number from `00` through `23`.

The target is:

```text
00
01
02
03
04
05
06
07
08
09
10
11
12
13
14
15
16
17
18
19
20
21
22
23
```

No duplicate numbered files should remain.

---

## Duplicate Number Validation

The framework must not contain cases such as:

```text
01-Context.md
01-Introduction.md
```

or:

```text
07-Build-Inputs-and-Project-Structure.md
07-Project-Structure.md
```

in final form.

Temporary migration copies must be removed before closure.

---

## Legacy File Validation

Files named:

```text
legacy-Introduction.md
legacy-Project-Structure.md
```

are migration aids only.

Final validation must confirm that all relevant content has been incorporated and that these files are removed.

---

## Empty File Validation

No normative chapter should remain unintentionally empty.

In particular, new chapters introduced during restructuring must contain complete content before validation passes.

---

## Unexpected File Validation

Unexpected files such as:

```text
.DS_Store
```

must not remain in the framework directory.

Temporary editor files, accidental output, or unrelated files must be removed.

---

## Document Inventory Validation

The final document inventory must match `MANIFEST.md`.

Any mismatch is a structural validation failure.

---

## Documentation Validation

Documentation validation determines whether each chapter fulfills its intended role.

---

## 00-EPIC Validation

`00-EPIC.md` must define:

* mission;
* scope;
* strategic position;
* Build Framework responsibility;
* build trust model;
* objectives;
* boundaries;
* deliverables;
* acceptance criteria.

---

## 01-Context Validation

`01-Context.md` must explain:

* why the framework exists;
* current FamilyOS engineering context;
* problem statement;
* build-specific risks;
* relationship with surrounding frameworks;
* build maturity context.

---

## 02-Vision Validation

`02-Vision.md` must define the strategic target state for FamilyOS build engineering.

---

## 03-Build-Principles Validation

`03-Build-Principles.md` must define durable engineering principles independent from specific tools.

---

## 04-Build-Architecture Validation

`04-Build-Architecture.md` must define structural build layers and responsibility boundaries.

---

## 05-Build-Lifecycle Validation

`05-Build-Lifecycle.md` must define temporal build progression from design through trusted artifact handoff and improvement.

---

## 06-Build-Input-Requirements Validation

This chapter must define what constitutes a build input and how such inputs are controlled.

---

## 07-Build-Inputs-and-Project-Structure Validation

This chapter must connect build semantics with repository and project structure.

---

## 08-Build-Toolchain Validation

This chapter must define toolchain governance without locking architecture unnecessarily to individual tools.

---

## 09-Build-Environment-Management Validation

This chapter must define environment control, reproducibility, validation, and isolation.

---

## 10-Dependency-Management Validation

This chapter must define dependency declaration, resolution, locking, updates, security, and traceability.

---

## 11-Build-Configuration Validation

This chapter must define canonical configuration, profiles, precedence, validation, and change governance.

---

## 12-Build-Philosophy Validation

This chapter must explain the conceptual meaning of build trust and the distinction between execution and trust.

---

## 13-Build-Execution Validation

This chapter must define the operational transformation stage from validated context to candidate artifacts.

---

## 14-Artifact-Management Validation

This chapter must define artifact identity, lifecycle, metadata, integrity, storage, and handoff.

---

## 15-Build-Validation Validation

This chapter must define how individual builds and artifacts are validated.

It must remain distinct from this framework-validation chapter.

---

## 16-Build-Governance Validation

This chapter must define ownership, decision classification, exceptions, debt, standards, and change governance.

---

## 17-Build-Automation-and-CI Validation

This chapter must define how automation executes canonical build semantics.

---

## 18-Roadmap Validation

This chapter must define incremental build maturity without prescribing unnecessary immediate infrastructure.

---

## 19-References Validation

This chapter must identify upstream, downstream, internal, and external references with appropriate ownership boundaries.

---

## 20-Validation Validation

This document must establish the criteria used to validate EPIC-BLD-001 itself.

---

## 21-Summary Validation

`21-Summary.md` must provide a concise but complete synthesis of the framework.

---

## 22-Release Validation

`22-Release.md` must define conditions for releasing the Build Framework documentation itself.

It must not replace EPIC-REL-001.

---

## 23-Implementation-Checklist Validation

`23-Implementation-Checklist.md` must translate normative framework concepts into an actionable implementation readiness checklist.

---

## Architectural Validation

Architectural validation determines whether the complete framework defines one coherent system.

The canonical Build Architecture must remain recognizable as:

```text
Inputs
  ↓
Context Resolution
  ↓
Environment
  ↓
Orchestration
  ↓
Execution
  ↓
Artifacts
  ↓
Validation
  ↓
Evidence
  ↓
Release Handoff
```

All chapters must support this model.

---

## Architectural Boundary Validation

The Build Framework must begin at controlled engineering state and end at trusted artifact handoff.

The boundary must remain:

```text
Engineering State
      ↓
BUILD FRAMEWORK
      ↓
Trusted Artifact + Evidence
      ↓
RELEASE FRAMEWORK
```

---

## Build Versus Release Validation

The framework must consistently preserve:

```text
Build Trust
    ≠
Release Approval
```

Any chapter implying that successful build automatically means release authorization is invalid.

---

## Build Versus Testing Validation

The framework may invoke tests.

It must not redefine:

* test architecture;
* test levels;
* fixture policy;
* testing philosophy.

Those remain under EPIC-TST-001.

---

## Build Versus Quality Validation

The framework may produce quality evidence and participate in gates.

It must not redefine the complete FamilyOS Quality Framework.

---

## Build Versus Documentation Validation

The framework may generate documentation artifacts.

Documentation standards and publishing governance remain under EPIC-DOC-001.

---

## Build Versus Plugin Compliance Validation

The framework may execute or consume plugin compliance validation.

Compliance rules remain owned by EPIC-PLUGIN-002.

---

## Build Trust Model Validation

The framework must consistently express Build Trust as a composition of controlled engineering properties.

A canonical expression is:

```text
Build Trust =
    Controlled Inputs
  + Controlled Configuration
  + Controlled Dependencies
  + Controlled Toolchain
  + Controlled Environment
  + Predictable Execution
  + Artifact Validation
  + Traceability
  + Evidence
  + Governance
```

---

## Lifecycle Validation

The Build Lifecycle must remain consistent across architecture, execution, artifact, and validation chapters.

A canonical lifecycle is:

```text
Design
  ↓
Prepare
  ↓
Resolve
  ↓
Validate
  ↓
Execute
  ↓
Identify Artifacts
  ↓
Validate Artifacts
  ↓
Generate Evidence
  ↓
Finalize
  ↓
Handoff
  ↓
Maintain
  ↓
Improve
```

---

## Lifecycle Completeness Validation

Validation must confirm that the framework does not end artificially at:

```text
Build Command Completed
```

The lifecycle must continue through artifact validation and evidence.

---

## Build Context Validation

The framework must consistently define Build Context as including relevant elements such as:

```text
Source
Configuration
Dependencies
Toolchain
Environment
Profile
Policies
```

Different chapters may specialize this model but must not contradict it.

---

## Build Profile Validation

Profiles such as:

```text
development
validation
ci
documentation
plugin
release-candidate
```

must have consistent semantic meaning across chapters.

---

## Artifact Model Validation

The Artifact Management model must consistently distinguish:

```text
Raw Output
Candidate Artifact
Validated Artifact
Trusted Artifact
```

These states must not be used interchangeably.

---

## Artifact Identity Validation

Trusted artifacts must have enough identity to support traceability.

The framework should consistently support association with:

* Build ID;
* source revision;
* artifact type;
* integrity data;
* validation state.

---

## Artifact Immutability Validation

The framework must maintain the rule:

```text
Trusted Artifact
      +
Modification
      ↓
Prior Trust Invalidated
```

---

## Build-Once-Promote Validation

The framework should consistently prefer:

```text
Build Once
    ↓
Validate
    ↓
Promote Same Bytes
```

over downstream rebuilds.

---

## Evidence Model Validation

Build Evidence must be consistently associated with the build that produced it.

Evidence may include:

* source revision;
* Build ID;
* dependency state;
* toolchain;
* environment;
* validation results;
* artifact manifest;
* checksums.

---

## Evidence Scope Validation

The framework must distinguish proportional evidence requirements by profile.

Not every local build requires full release-candidate evidence.

---

## Configuration Model Validation

The Build Configuration model must define:

* configuration sources;
* deterministic precedence;
* profile selection;
* validation;
* effective configuration;
* secret separation.

---

## Dependency Model Validation

Dependency Management must consistently define:

* declaration;
* constraints;
* resolution;
* locking where required;
* compatibility;
* update governance;
* security.

---

## Toolchain Model Validation

Build Toolchain must consistently distinguish architecture from implementation tools.

Tool changes must not redefine framework semantics.

---

## Environment Model Validation

Build Environment Management must consistently preserve:

```text
Different Physical Environment
        ↓
Controlled Requirements
        ↓
Equivalent Build Semantics
```

---

## Automation Validation

The framework must consistently preserve:

```text
Build Architecture
      ↓
Canonical Build Interface
      ↓
CI Adapter
```

CI must not be described as the source of build architecture.

---

## Local And CI Alignment Validation

Validation must confirm that the framework expects local and CI builds to share canonical semantics.

---

## CI Permissions Validation

Automation documentation must preserve separation between:

* build permissions;
* release permissions;
* deployment permissions.

---

## Release Candidate Automation Validation

The release-candidate profile should consistently represent stronger build controls without automatically granting release authority.

---

## Governance Validation

Build Governance must define sufficient mechanisms for controlled framework evolution.

Validation should confirm the presence of:

* ownership;
* decision classification;
* review levels;
* ADR relationship;
* RFC relationship;
* exception handling;
* technical debt management;
* risk awareness;
* change lifecycle.

---

## Governance Proportionality Validation

The framework must not require ADR or RFC for routine internal maintenance.

Governance should remain proportional to change impact.

---

## Exception Validation

Any exception model must require explicit scope and justification.

The framework must not normalize permanent hidden exceptions.

---

## Technical Debt Validation

Build debt must be treated as real engineering debt.

This expectation should remain consistent across Governance, Roadmap, and Summary documents.

---

## Security Validation

Security-related Build Framework requirements must remain consistent with Security Architecture.

Important principles include:

* least privilege;
* secret isolation;
* dependency trust;
* toolchain trust;
* artifact integrity;
* supply-chain awareness.

---

## Secret Boundary Validation

The framework must consistently prohibit ordinary build artifacts or evidence from containing secrets.

---

## Supply Chain Validation

Future capabilities such as provenance, signing, SBOMs, and trusted builders must remain clearly identified as maturity extensions unless formally adopted.

---

## Reference Validation

`19-References.md` must maintain accurate ownership boundaries.

Internal framework references should be prioritized over generic external guidance.

---

## Normative Reference Validation

External standards must not become normative accidentally.

Formal adoption requires an explicit FamilyOS engineering decision.

---

## Cross-Reference Validation

Document references must point to the correct current filenames.

Obsolete filenames inherited from earlier framework structure must not remain.

Examples that must no longer appear as canonical Build Framework chapters include:

```text
03-Engineering-Principles.md
04-Repository-Architecture.md
05-Development-Workflow.md
06-Coding-Standards.md
07-Project-Structure.md
08-Toolchain.md
09-Environment-Management.md
11-Configuration-Management.md
13-Testing-Philosophy.md
14-Documentation-Philosophy.md
15-Quality-Philosophy.md
16-Technical-Governance.md
17-Engineering-Lifecycle.md
```

Any remaining reference should be reviewed and corrected.

---

## Terminology Validation

The following terminology should be used consistently.

---

### Build

A controlled process transforming engineering inputs into candidate artifacts.

---

### Build Context

The effective state influencing a build.

---

### Build ID

An identifier associated with a significant build execution.

---

### Candidate Artifact

An output identified as an intended artifact but not yet fully trusted.

---

### Trusted Artifact

An artifact that satisfied applicable build requirements.

---

### Build Evidence

Information supporting the explanation of build origin, execution, validation, and trust.

---

### Release Handoff

The boundary through which trusted Build outputs are provided to the Release Framework.

---

## Terminology Conflict Validation

The framework should not alternate between terms such as:

```text
build output
release artifact
trusted artifact
package
```

as if they were always equivalent.

Context must remain explicit.

---

## Documentation Quality Validation

Each chapter should demonstrate:

* clear purpose;
* logical section hierarchy;
* coherent terminology;
* explicit boundaries;
* actionable engineering principles;
* no obvious content duplication without purpose.

---

## Duplication Validation

Some repetition across framework chapters is intentional for normative clarity.

However, duplicated text that creates inconsistent variants of the same rule is a defect.

---

## Contradiction Validation

The framework must be reviewed for contradictions such as:

```text
one chapter requires exact pinning
another forbids exact pinning
```

without context or profile distinction.

---

## Maturity Language Validation

Terms such as:

```text
MUST
SHOULD
MAY
future
eventually
could
```

must be used deliberately.

Future-state capabilities must not be expressed as immediate mandatory requirements unless intended.

---

## Implementation Readiness Validation

The framework must provide enough clarity to guide real implementation.

An engineer should be able to derive from EPIC-BLD-001:

* canonical build responsibilities;
* expected build stages;
* artifact handling expectations;
* validation requirements;
* automation boundaries;
* release handoff responsibilities.

---

## Implementation Independence Validation

The framework must not require an unnecessary implementation architecture before FamilyOS needs it.

For example, the framework should not require:

* containers;
* remote builders;
* artifact registries;
* distributed build systems;

as immediate prerequisites.

---

## Current Tooling Compatibility Validation

The framework should remain implementable with the current FamilyOS engineering stack.

This may include:

* Python;
* virtual environments;
* Git;
* Ruff;
* MyPy;
* Pytest;
* standard Python packaging;
* CI.

The framework may allow future tooling evolution without requiring replacement now.

---

## Roadmap Consistency Validation

`18-Roadmap.md` must align future capabilities with the rest of the framework.

The progression should remain incremental.

A consistent model is:

```text
Foundation
  ↓
Standardization
  ↓
Validation
  ↓
Automation
  ↓
Artifact Trust
  ↓
Reproducibility
  ↓
Release Integration
  ↓
Supply Chain Assurance
```

---

## Control Document Validation

Framework control documents must remain synchronized.

---

## EPIC.yaml Validation

`EPIC.yaml` should accurately represent:

* EPIC identifier;
* title;
* status;
* dependencies;
* deliverables;
* related decisions;
* lifecycle state.

---

## EPIC-BLD-001.md Validation

The summary EPIC document should align with `00-EPIC.md`.

Scope, acceptance criteria, and deliverables must not conflict.

---

## README.md Validation

`README.md` should accurately describe:

* purpose;
* structure;
* status;
* navigation;
* related frameworks.

---

## MANIFEST.md Validation

`MANIFEST.md` should list the final normative and control documents.

It must not include deleted legacy filenames.

---

## CHANGELOG.md Validation

The changelog should record the structural migration and completion of the canonical Build Framework where appropriate.

---

## Revision-History.md Validation

Revision history should record meaningful framework evolution, including restructuring from the inherited Engineering Foundation layout if retained as historical context.

---

## VALIDATION.md Validation

The top-level `VALIDATION.md` should record the final validation status of EPIC-BLD-001.

It should not claim completion before the validation criteria in this document are satisfied.

---

## Final Structure Validation

Before closure, the final tree should conceptually be:

```text
EPIC-BLD-001-build-framework/
├── 00-EPIC.md
├── 01-Context.md
├── 02-Vision.md
├── 03-Build-Principles.md
├── 04-Build-Architecture.md
├── 05-Build-Lifecycle.md
├── 06-Build-Input-Requirements.md
├── 07-Build-Inputs-and-Project-Structure.md
├── 08-Build-Toolchain.md
├── 09-Build-Environment-Management.md
├── 10-Dependency-Management.md
├── 11-Build-Configuration.md
├── 12-Build-Philosophy.md
├── 13-Build-Execution.md
├── 14-Artifact-Management.md
├── 15-Build-Validation.md
├── 16-Build-Governance.md
├── 17-Build-Automation-and-CI.md
├── 18-Roadmap.md
├── 19-References.md
├── 20-Validation.md
├── 21-Summary.md
├── 22-Release.md
├── 23-Implementation-Checklist.md
├── CHANGELOG.md
├── EPIC-BLD-001.md
├── EPIC.yaml
├── MANIFEST.md
├── README.md
├── Revision-History.md
└── VALIDATION.md
```

This represents **24 numbered framework chapters + 7 control documents = 31 final files**.

---

## Legacy Removal Validation

Final closure requires removal of:

```text
legacy-Introduction.md
legacy-Project-Structure.md
```

after confirming all required content has been incorporated.

---

## Git Cleanliness Validation

The framework should reach a controlled Git state before release.

Validation should confirm:

* no accidental untracked files;
* no unintended temporary files;
* expected renames are represented;
* final files are tracked;
* migration state is intentional.

---

## Content Completeness Validation

Every normative chapter should contain enough information to stand independently within its assigned responsibility.

A chapter should not depend on an undocumented assumption that another file will define its missing core responsibility later.

---

## Cross-Framework Integration Validation

The framework should explicitly integrate with:

```text
EPIC-ENG-001
EPIC-TST-001
EPIC-QLT-001
EPIC-DOC-001
EPIC-PLUGIN-002
EPIC-REL-001
```

where appropriate.

---

## Release Framework Readiness Validation

EPIC-BLD-001 is ready for downstream EPIC-REL-001 work when the Build Framework provides a stable definition of:

* trusted artifact;
* artifact identity;
* artifact integrity;
* build evidence;
* release candidate profile;
* release handoff.

---

## Acceptance Validation

The acceptance criteria defined in `00-EPIC.md` must be reviewed individually before closure.

No acceptance criterion should remain ambiguous or unassessed.

---

## Implementation Checklist Alignment

`23-Implementation-Checklist.md` must map implementation work to the framework model.

The checklist should not introduce architectural requirements absent from normative chapters.

---

## Validation Status Model

Framework validation may use the following conceptual states:

```text
NOT_STARTED
IN_PROGRESS
PARTIALLY_VALIDATED
VALIDATED
FAILED
```

Final closure requires:

```text
VALIDATED
```

---

## Validation Findings

Findings may be classified conceptually as:

```text
CRITICAL
MAJOR
MINOR
OBSERVATION
```

A formal findings system is optional.

The classification helps prioritize corrections.

---

## Critical Finding

A critical finding prevents closure.

Examples include:

* missing normative chapter;
* contradictory architecture;
* unclear Build/Release boundary;
* missing validation model.

---

## Major Finding

A major finding materially weakens framework consistency.

Examples include:

* outdated references;
* inconsistent artifact terminology;
* control-document mismatch.

---

## Minor Finding

A minor finding may include:

* formatting inconsistency;
* small terminology drift;
* non-blocking documentation issue.

---

## Observation

An observation identifies possible future improvement without representing non-compliance.

---

## Validation Evidence

Framework validation evidence may include:

* final `tree`;
* file counts;
* file sizes;
* heading inventory;
* duplicate-number checks;
* empty-file checks;
* reference searches;
* Git status;
* manual architectural review.

---

## Structural Validation Commands

A future validation workflow may use shell checks such as:

```text
find
tree
wc
grep
git status
```

to confirm structural state.

These commands support evidence.

They do not replace semantic review.

---

## Duplicate Heading And Filename Review

Automated checks should be supplemented by manual review to detect semantic duplicates that filename checks cannot identify.

---

## Empty Document Review

A zero-byte or nearly empty normative document should fail structural validation unless intentionally reserved and documented.

---

## Reference Search

The final framework should be searched for obsolete filenames and terminology.

Examples include searching for:

```text
Engineering-Principles
Repository-Architecture
Development-Workflow
Coding-Standards
Testing-Philosophy
Documentation-Philosophy
Quality-Philosophy
Engineering-Lifecycle
```

within EPIC-BLD-001.

Remaining occurrences must be reviewed.

---

## Final Validation Sequence

The recommended final validation sequence is:

```text
1. Validate Final Tree
2. Validate File Count
3. Validate No Empty Normative Files
4. Validate No Duplicate Numbers
5. Validate No Legacy Files
6. Validate No Obsolete Canonical References
7. Validate Core Terminology
8. Validate Architectural Boundaries
9. Validate Build/Release Handoff
10. Validate Cross-Framework Relationships
11. Validate Control Documents
12. Validate Implementation Checklist
13. Review Git State
14. Record VALIDATION.md Result
15. Finalize Framework Release
```

---

## Closure Criteria

EPIC-BLD-001 may be considered structurally and architecturally complete when:

1. all 24 numbered chapters exist;
2. all seven control documents exist;
3. no temporary migration documents remain;
4. no duplicate chapter numbers remain;
5. no obsolete inherited canonical filenames remain;
6. all chapters match their intended responsibility;
7. Build Architecture is coherent;
8. Build Lifecycle is coherent;
9. Build Context is consistently defined;
10. Artifact Management is complete;
11. Build Validation is complete;
12. Build Automation is complete;
13. Build Governance is complete;
14. Release handoff is explicit;
15. references are current;
16. roadmap is aligned;
17. implementation checklist is complete;
18. control documents are synchronized;
19. final validation evidence is recorded;
20. no unresolved critical or major validation findings remain.

---

## Validation Outcome

The final validation outcome should answer one question:

```text
Can EPIC-BLD-001 now serve as the authoritative Build Framework for FamilyOS?
```

A positive answer requires more than complete files.

It requires architectural coherence.

## Validation Invariants

The following invariants must hold at final validation.

### Invariant 1

There is exactly one canonical document for every numbered chapter.

### Invariant 2

Document names and document responsibilities match.

### Invariant 3

Build and Release responsibilities remain separated.

### Invariant 4

Testing and Quality ownership remain external to the Build Framework.

### Invariant 5

Trusted artifacts require validation.

### Invariant 6

Trusted artifacts have traceable origin.

### Invariant 7

Automation executes canonical build semantics.

### Invariant 8

Future maturity capabilities are clearly distinguished from current requirements.

### Invariant 9

Control documents reflect the same final framework state.

### Invariant 10

Temporary migration state is removed before closure.

Validate Architecture
      ↓
Validate Boundaries
      ↓
Validate Integration
      ↓
Validate Governance
      ↓
Validate Control Documents

## Final Principle

The validation of EPIC-BLD-001 is founded on the following rule:

> A framework that defines trustworthy builds must itself be structurally trustworthy, architecturally coherent, traceable, and internally consistent.

EPIC-BLD-001 should not be closed merely because all documents exist.

It should be closed only when the complete documentation set defines one understandable Build Framework, with clear ownership, stable terminology, explicit boundaries, coherent lifecycle semantics, trusted artifact rules, and a controlled handoff to the Release Framework.

Only then can the Build Framework become a dependable foundation for future FamilyOS build implementation.
