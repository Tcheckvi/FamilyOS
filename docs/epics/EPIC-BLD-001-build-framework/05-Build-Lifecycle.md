# Build Framework

## 05 Build Lifecycle

### Overview

EPIC-BLD-001 — Build Framework defines the lifecycle through which FamilyOS build capabilities are designed, prepared, executed, validated, maintained, and improved.

The Build Lifecycle provides the temporal model of the Build Framework.

Where the Build Architecture defines the structural responsibilities of the build system, the Build Lifecycle defines how those responsibilities evolve through time.

The lifecycle ensures that FamilyOS build behavior is not understood only as a single command execution.

Instead, build engineering is treated as a continuous process that includes:

* design;
* preparation;
* configuration;
* validation;
* execution;
* artifact management;
* evidence generation;
* maintenance;
* improvement;
* governance.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of the Build Lifecycle is to provide a consistent model for managing build capabilities across the complete FamilyOS Engineering Platform.

It answers the question:

```text
What happens before, during, and after a FamilyOS build?
```

The framework must make all major lifecycle phases explicit.

---

## Lifecycle Model

The canonical Build Lifecycle is:

```text
Design
  ↓
Prepare
  ↓
Resolve Context
  ↓
Validate Inputs
  ↓
Validate Environment
  ↓
Execute Build
  ↓
Produce Artifacts
  ↓
Validate Artifacts
  ↓
Generate Evidence
  ↓
Finalize Build
  ↓
Handoff
  ↓
Maintain
  ↓
Improve
```

This lifecycle applies conceptually to all significant FamilyOS build operations.

Individual build profiles may specialize or simplify particular phases.

---

## Lifecycle Scope

The Build Lifecycle covers:

* build capability design;
* build input preparation;
* dependency preparation;
* configuration resolution;
* environment preparation;
* build context resolution;
* pre-build validation;
* execution;
* artifact creation;
* artifact classification;
* artifact validation;
* evidence generation;
* build result finalization;
* release handoff preparation;
* maintenance;
* observability;
* continuous improvement.

---

## Lifecycle Boundary

The Build Lifecycle begins before execution.

It begins when a build capability is designed or when a specific build request is prepared.

It ends only after the resulting build state has been:

* finalized;
* validated;
* recorded;
* handed off or discarded;
* made available for subsequent maintenance or analysis.

This prevents the build lifecycle from being reduced to:

```text
start command
    ↓
command exits
```

The actual lifecycle is broader.

---

## Phase 1 — Build Design

Build design defines how a particular FamilyOS component is expected to participate in the Build Framework.

This phase occurs when:

* a new component is introduced;
* a new artifact type is added;
* packaging changes;
* build requirements evolve;
* new automation is introduced;
* architecture changes.

---

## Build Design Objectives

Build design should determine:

* build purpose;
* expected inputs;
* expected outputs;
* applicable profiles;
* required tools;
* dependency requirements;
* environment requirements;
* validation requirements;
* evidence requirements;
* release handoff expectations.

The design should align with the canonical Build Architecture.

---

## Build Design Questions

A build capability should answer:

```text
What is being built?

Why is it being built?

Which inputs are authoritative?

Which dependencies are required?

Which tools perform the transformation?

Which environment is supported?

Which artifacts should exist?

Which validations are mandatory?

Which evidence should be retained?

Who consumes the result?
```

Unanswered design questions often become hidden implementation assumptions.

---

## Design Governance

Build design changes may require governance when they affect:

* artifact contracts;
* build boundaries;
* dependency architecture;
* toolchain architecture;
* validation semantics;
* release handoff;
* plugin build behavior.

Routine implementation details may remain within normal code review.

Significant architectural changes may require ADR or RFC treatment.

---

## Phase 2 — Build Preparation

Preparation converts build intent into an executable request.

Preparation may include:

* selecting the component;
* selecting the build profile;
* locating source inputs;
* locating configuration;
* checking repository state;
* preparing temporary output locations;
* initializing build identity.

The objective is to establish a well-defined starting point.

---

## Build Request

A conceptual build request may contain:

```text
BuildRequest
│
├── Target
├── Profile
├── Source Context
├── Configuration Overrides
├── Requested Artifacts
└── Execution Options
```

The exact representation is implementation-specific.

---

## Build Identity Creation

Significant builds should progressively receive a stable build identifier.

Build identity may be established during preparation or context resolution.

The identifier allows later association between:

```text
Build Request
      ↓
Execution
      ↓
Artifacts
      ↓
Evidence
```

---

## Phase 3 — Build Context Resolution

Context resolution determines the effective state of the build.

The build system resolves:

* source revision;
* working tree state;
* active profile;
* build configuration;
* dependency state;
* toolchain state;
* environment assumptions;
* policy requirements;
* expected outputs.

This creates the effective Build Context.

---

## Context Resolution Model

```text
Raw Inputs
    ↓
Profile Selection
    ↓
Configuration Resolution
    ↓
Dependency Resolution
    ↓
Toolchain Resolution
    ↓
Environment Detection
    ↓
Policy Resolution
    ↓
Effective Build Context
```

The effective context should be stable before significant execution begins.

---

## Context Validation

The resolved context should be checked for internal consistency.

Examples include:

* profile exists;
* required configuration is present;
* runtime version is supported;
* dependency declarations are valid;
* required tools are available;
* target artifact type is supported.

Invalid context should fail before build execution.

---

## Phase 4 — Input Validation

Input validation confirms that build inputs satisfy applicable requirements.

Inputs may include:

* source files;
* package metadata;
* project configuration;
* schemas;
* templates;
* dependency definitions;
* lock files;
* generation inputs;
* plugin metadata.

---

## Input Validation Objectives

Input validation should detect:

* missing inputs;
* malformed configuration;
* invalid metadata;
* incompatible source state;
* unsupported dependency state;
* missing generated prerequisites;
* inconsistent project structure.

The earlier these problems are detected, the more efficient the build process becomes.

---

## Source State Validation

For some build profiles, source state may require additional checks.

A release-candidate build may require:

* identifiable Git revision;
* clean working tree;
* complete metadata;
* no prohibited untracked build inputs.

Development builds may use more permissive rules.

The profile determines the required strictness.

---

## Phase 5 — Dependency Preparation

Dependencies must be resolved before reliable execution.

Dependency preparation may include:

* reading dependency declarations;
* applying version constraints;
* using lock information;
* validating compatibility;
* ensuring required packages are available;
* recording dependency state.

---

## Dependency Lifecycle

```text
Declaration
    ↓
Constraint Resolution
    ↓
Dependency Selection
    ↓
Availability
    ↓
Validation
    ↓
Build Context
```

Dependency resolution must not become an invisible side effect.

---

## Dependency Failure

Dependency preparation may fail because of:

* unavailable package;
* invalid version constraint;
* incompatible versions;
* corrupted package;
* policy violation;
* network dependency when unavailable.

Such failures should be classified before execution begins where practical.

---

## Phase 6 — Toolchain Validation

The build toolchain must be suitable for the requested build.

Validation may include:

* runtime version;
* build frontend;
* build backend;
* package manager;
* generators;
* archive tools;
* validation tools.

---

## Toolchain Lifecycle

```text
Tool Requirement
      ↓
Tool Discovery
      ↓
Version Check
      ↓
Compatibility Check
      ↓
Validated Toolchain
```

Toolchain validation reduces machine-specific ambiguity.

---

## Phase 7 — Environment Validation

The build environment must satisfy applicable execution requirements.

Environment validation may include:

* operating system compatibility;
* runtime availability;
* filesystem permissions;
* required environment variables;
* virtual environment state;
* temporary space;
* network policy;
* isolation requirements.

---

## Environment States

A build environment may be classified conceptually as:

```text
UNKNOWN
  ↓
DETECTED
  ↓
VALIDATED
```

Execution should begin only after required environment conditions are known.

---

## Environment Failure

An unsupported environment must fail explicitly rather than produce undefined behavior.

Examples include:

```text
Unsupported Python Version

Missing Required Tool

Invalid Virtual Environment

Missing Build Variable

Unsupported Platform
```

---

## Phase 8 — Build Preparation Execution

After validation succeeds, the build system may perform operational preparation.

This may include:

* cleaning output directories;
* creating temporary directories;
* preparing generation locations;
* initializing manifests;
* initializing logs;
* materializing configuration.

This phase prepares the execution workspace.

---

## Clean State Principle

Where appropriate, builds should support preparation from a clean state.

This helps detect hidden dependencies on stale outputs.

```text
Clean Workspace
      ↓
Controlled Preparation
      ↓
Build Execution
```

---

## Phase 9 — Build Execution

Build execution performs the actual transformation.

This may include:

* source generation;
* resource transformation;
* metadata generation;
* packaging;
* archive creation;
* documentation generation;
* plugin packaging;
* manifest creation.

Execution follows the Build Architecture defined in `04-Build-Architecture.md`.

---

## Execution Model

```text
Prepared Context
      ↓
Stage 1
      ↓
Stage 2
      ↓
Stage 3
      ↓
Raw Outputs
```

Stages depend on build type.

Their responsibilities should remain explicit.

---

## Execution Status

A build execution may expose states such as:

```text
PENDING
RUNNING
SUCCEEDED
FAILED
CANCELLED
```

The exact model may evolve.

The Build Framework requires clear terminal outcomes.

---

## Execution Failure

When execution fails, the lifecycle transitions into controlled failure handling.

The build must not continue to artifact trust.

```text
Execution Failure
       ↓
Capture Diagnostics
       ↓
Finalize Failed Build
       ↓
Stop Artifact Promotion
```

Partial outputs should not automatically be treated as valid artifacts.

---

## Phase 10 — Artifact Discovery

After successful execution, produced outputs must be identified.

The build system determines:

* which files were generated;
* which outputs are expected artifacts;
* which outputs are intermediate;
* which outputs are temporary;
* which outputs are evidence.

This prevents raw build outputs from being treated indiscriminately.

---

## Artifact Discovery Model

```text
Raw Build Output
      ↓
Discovery
      ↓
Classification
      ↓
Artifact Set
```

Only classified outputs participate in artifact validation.

---

## Phase 11 — Artifact Identification

Each significant artifact should receive sufficient identity.

Identification may include:

* artifact name;
* artifact type;
* build identifier;
* source revision;
* version context;
* checksum;
* metadata references.

---

## Artifact Identity Lifecycle

```text
Generated File
     ↓
Classified Output
     ↓
Identified Artifact
```

An identified artifact is still not automatically trusted.

Validation remains required.

---

## Phase 12 — Artifact Validation

Artifact validation determines whether outputs satisfy applicable requirements.

Validation may include:

* expected artifact presence;
* naming;
* package structure;
* metadata;
* integrity;
* installation;
* content requirements;
* plugin compliance;
* documentation validation.

---

## Artifact Validation Flow

```text
Identified Artifact
        ↓
Structural Validation
        ↓
Metadata Validation
        ↓
Integrity Validation
        ↓
Functional Validation
        ↓
Trusted Candidate
```

Applicable stages depend on artifact type.

---

## Artifact Validation Failure

If artifact validation fails:

```text
Artifact
   ↓
Validation Failure
   ↓
Build Fails
```

The artifact must not be handed off as trusted output.

---

## Phase 13 — Evidence Generation

Once execution and validation information is available, the build system may assemble evidence.

Evidence can include:

* build identifier;
* source revision;
* profile;
* configuration;
* dependency state;
* toolchain state;
* environment information;
* execution results;
* artifact manifest;
* checksums;
* validation results.

---

## Evidence Lifecycle

```text
Context
  +
Execution Data
  +
Artifact Data
  +
Validation Results
       ↓
Build Evidence
```

Evidence must remain associated with the relevant build.

---

## Evidence Strength

Evidence requirements vary by profile.

```text
Development
    ↓
Basic Evidence

CI
    ↓
Standard Evidence

Release Candidate
    ↓
Strong Evidence
```

The framework allows proportional evidence without weakening core trust principles.

---

## Phase 14 — Build Finalization

Build finalization establishes the final build result.

A conceptual Build Result may include:

```text
BuildResult
│
├── Build ID
├── Status
├── Profile
├── Artifact Set
├── Validation Status
├── Evidence
├── Metrics
└── Diagnostics
```

The result should be stable after finalization.

---

## Successful Build Finalization

A successful finalization indicates that:

* required stages completed;
* expected artifacts exist;
* required validation succeeded;
* evidence requirements were satisfied.

The result may then become eligible for downstream handoff.

---

## Failed Build Finalization

A failed build should still produce a useful result.

This may include:

* failure stage;
* diagnostics;
* logs;
* validation details;
* partial metrics.

Failure evidence supports debugging and quality improvement.

---

## Phase 15 — Trusted Artifact Declaration

Artifacts become trusted only when applicable lifecycle requirements succeed.

The boundary is:

```text
Generated Output
      ↓
Identified Artifact
      ↓
Validated Artifact
      ↓
Evidence Available
      ↓
Trusted Artifact
```

This distinction is fundamental.

---

## Trust Is Profile-Dependent

Trust requirements may depend on intended use.

A local development artifact may be trusted for local testing but not for official release.

A release candidate requires stronger evidence.

Therefore:

```text
Artifact Trust
      =
Contextual Trust
```

Trust must always be interpreted relative to a build profile and downstream purpose.

---

## Phase 16 — Release Handoff

When a build produces artifacts eligible for release consideration, the Build Framework prepares handoff information.

A conceptual handoff includes:

```text
Release Handoff
│
├── Build Result
├── Artifacts
├── Artifact Metadata
├── Integrity Information
├── Validation Results
└── Evidence References
```

The Release Framework decides what happens next.

---

## Handoff Boundary

The Build Framework ends its authority at handoff.

It does not decide:

* official version publication;
* release approval;
* release promotion;
* distribution;
* release communication;
* deployment.

Those remain release responsibilities.

---

## Phase 17 — Cleanup

After finalization, temporary build state may be cleaned.

Cleanup may include:

* temporary files;
* intermediate artifacts;
* transient configuration;
* local staging directories.

Cleanup must not remove evidence or artifacts required downstream.

---

## Cleanup Rules

Temporary state should be distinguishable from trusted output.

```text
Temporary State
      ↓
Cleanup

Trusted Artifact
      ↓
Preserve
```

---

## Phase 18 — Build Retention

Some build information may need retention.

Retention requirements may apply to:

* CI logs;
* validation reports;
* artifacts;
* manifests;
* checksums;
* provenance metadata.

Retention policy may depend on environment and downstream needs.

---

## Local Retention

Development builds may retain minimal information.

Developers may intentionally clean local outputs frequently.

---

## CI Retention

CI may retain:

* logs;
* artifacts;
* test reports;
* build reports.

The Build Framework defines the need for evidence but does not mandate a particular CI retention platform.

---

## Release Candidate Retention

Release candidate build evidence may require stronger retention to support:

* release approval;
* reproducibility;
* incident analysis;
* auditability.

Detailed policy belongs to the intersection of Build and Release governance.

---

## Phase 19 — Maintenance

Build capabilities require active maintenance.

Maintenance includes:

* dependency updates;
* toolchain updates;
* configuration updates;
* environment support updates;
* build script maintenance;
* CI integration maintenance;
* documentation maintenance.

Build infrastructure is not static.

---

## Toolchain Maintenance

Toolchain updates should be evaluated for:

* compatibility;
* reproducibility impact;
* artifact changes;
* performance changes;
* security implications.

Significant changes may require validation beyond simple version replacement.

---

## Dependency Maintenance

Dependency changes may influence build output.

Therefore dependency maintenance must follow controlled engineering practices.

---

## Configuration Maintenance

Obsolete configuration should be removed.

Configuration must remain understandable and documented.

Accumulated unused build configuration is a form of build debt.

---

## Phase 20 — Build Observability Review

Build systems should be periodically evaluated for observability quality.

Questions include:

```text
Can failures be diagnosed?

Are stages understandable?

Are important timings visible?

Can artifact creation be traced?

Can validation outcomes be interpreted?
```

Poor observability creates hidden maintenance cost.

---

## Phase 21 — Build Performance Review

Build performance should be reviewed when it materially affects developer or CI productivity.

Possible optimization areas include:

* caching;
* parallel execution;
* selective validation;
* incremental generation;
* reusable environments.

Optimization must preserve canonical semantics.

---

## Performance Lifecycle

```text
Measure
   ↓
Identify Bottleneck
   ↓
Evaluate Risk
   ↓
Optimize
   ↓
Validate Semantics
   ↓
Measure Again
```

Optimization without measurement should be avoided.

---

## Phase 22 — Build Debt Management

Build systems accumulate technical debt.

Examples include:

* duplicated scripts;
* legacy build commands;
* obsolete configuration;
* undocumented dependencies;
* stale environment assumptions;
* CI-only logic;
* unused artifact formats.

This debt should be identified and managed explicitly.

---

## Build Debt Indicators

Possible signals include:

* frequent local/CI differences;
* unexplained build failures;
* repeated manual intervention;
* difficult upgrades;
* fragile scripts;
* inconsistent artifact generation;
* undocumented workarounds.

These signals should trigger review.

---

## Phase 23 — Continuous Improvement

The Build Framework supports continuous improvement.

Improvement sources include:

* build failures;
* developer feedback;
* CI performance;
* quality findings;
* security findings;
* release incidents;
* dependency problems;
* observability data.

---

## Improvement Loop

```text
Observe
   ↓
Measure
   ↓
Identify Weakness
   ↓
Design Improvement
   ↓
Implement
   ↓
Validate
   ↓
Document
   ↓
Standardize
```

This creates a feedback loop between build operations and framework evolution.

---

## Lifecycle Profiles

Different build profiles may execute different subsets of the lifecycle.

---

## Development Lifecycle

A development build may follow:

```text
Prepare
  ↓
Resolve Context
  ↓
Validate Minimum Requirements
  ↓
Execute
  ↓
Validate Artifact
  ↓
Return Result
```

It prioritizes fast feedback.

---

## CI Lifecycle

A CI build may follow:

```text
Repository Revision
      ↓
Resolve Context
      ↓
Strict Input Validation
      ↓
Environment Validation
      ↓
Execution
      ↓
Artifact Validation
      ↓
Evidence Generation
      ↓
CI Result
```

It prioritizes repeatability and independent verification.

---

## Release Candidate Lifecycle

A release candidate build may require:

```text
Clean Source State
      ↓
Strict Context Resolution
      ↓
Locked Dependencies
      ↓
Validated Toolchain
      ↓
Controlled Environment
      ↓
Full Build
      ↓
Complete Validation
      ↓
Artifact Integrity
      ↓
Strong Evidence
      ↓
Release Handoff
```

This is typically the strictest build lifecycle.

---

## Plugin Build Lifecycle

Official plugins may use a specialized lifecycle:

```text
Plugin Source
     ↓
Plugin Metadata Validation
     ↓
Compliance Validation
     ↓
Plugin Build
     ↓
Artifact Validation
     ↓
Evidence
     ↓
Plugin Artifact
```

The plugin lifecycle remains subordinate to the canonical Build Framework.

---

## Documentation Build Lifecycle

Documentation artifacts may follow:

```text
Documentation Sources
        ↓
Validation
        ↓
Generation
        ↓
Output Validation
        ↓
Documentation Artifact
```

This allows generated documentation to participate in controlled build processes where appropriate.

---

## Lifecycle State Model

A conceptual lifecycle state machine may include:

```text
CREATED
   ↓
PREPARING
   ↓
RESOLVING
   ↓
VALIDATING
   ↓
EXECUTING
   ↓
PROCESSING_ARTIFACTS
   ↓
GENERATING_EVIDENCE
   ↓
FINALIZING
   ↓
COMPLETED
```

Failure may transition from any active state to:

```text
FAILED
```

Cancellation may transition to:

```text
CANCELLED
```

The exact implementation may remain simpler.

---

## Lifecycle Invariants

The following lifecycle invariants should remain true.

### Invariant 1

Context must resolve before significant execution.

### Invariant 2

Invalid mandatory inputs must stop the build.

### Invariant 3

Unsupported mandatory environment state must stop the build.

### Invariant 4

Execution failure must prevent trusted artifact declaration.

### Invariant 5

Artifact validation must precede release handoff.

### Invariant 6

Evidence must refer to the correct build.

### Invariant 7

Cleanup must not destroy required trusted artifacts or evidence.

### Invariant 8

Release authority begins only after build handoff.

---

## Lifecycle Failure Model

Failures are classified by lifecycle stage.

```text
Build Failure
│
├── Preparation Failure
├── Context Failure
├── Input Failure
├── Dependency Failure
├── Toolchain Failure
├── Environment Failure
├── Execution Failure
├── Artifact Failure
├── Validation Failure
└── Finalization Failure
```

Classification improves diagnosis and metrics.

---

## Recoverable And Non-Recoverable Failure

Some failures may be recoverable.

Examples:

* temporary dependency availability;
* transient CI environment issue.

Others require source or configuration correction.

Examples:

* invalid metadata;
* incompatible dependency versions;
* failed validation.

The build system should avoid unsafe automatic recovery that hides real problems.

---

## Cancellation

Build cancellation may occur because of:

* user request;
* CI supersession;
* upstream failure;
* infrastructure interruption.

Cancellation must not result in a trusted artifact.

Partial outputs should remain clearly marked as non-final.

---

## Lifecycle Observability

Each lifecycle stage should expose useful observability.

Possible dimensions include:

* stage start;
* stage completion;
* duration;
* status;
* failure category;
* warning count;
* artifact count;
* validation count.

These dimensions may later support quality metrics.

---

## Lifecycle Metrics

Potential build lifecycle metrics include:

```text
Build Duration

Success Rate

Failure Rate

Failure Stage Distribution

Artifact Validation Failure Rate

Dependency Resolution Time

Environment Failure Rate

Build Reproducibility Rate
```

The Quality Framework governs how metrics become formal quality indicators.

---

## Lifecycle Automation

Automation should support the lifecycle without removing its conceptual stages.

CI may combine multiple lifecycle steps into a single job.

The underlying responsibilities still exist.

For example:

```text
CI Job
│
├── Context Resolution
├── Validation
├── Execution
├── Artifact Processing
└── Evidence
```

---

## Lifecycle Documentation

Important lifecycle behavior must be documented.

Documentation should make clear:

* entry points;
* profiles;
* stages;
* validation;
* artifacts;
* failure behavior;
* downstream handoff.

This supports maintainability and onboarding.

---

## Lifecycle Security

Security considerations apply throughout the lifecycle.

Examples include:

```text
Preparation
    ↓
Secret Exposure Risk

Dependency Resolution
    ↓
Supply Chain Risk

Execution
    ↓
Privilege Risk

Artifact Handling
    ↓
Integrity Risk
```

Security controls must be applied at the appropriate stages.

---

## Lifecycle Governance

Lifecycle changes should be governed according to impact.

Examples of significant changes include:

* introducing a new mandatory stage;
* changing artifact trust requirements;
* modifying release handoff;
* introducing signing;
* changing dependency resolution semantics;
* introducing remote build execution.

These may require architectural review.

---

## Lifecycle Evolution

The Build Lifecycle itself may mature.

A possible progression is:

```text
Lifecycle v1
Documented Manual Flow

        ↓

Lifecycle v2
Standardized Commands

        ↓

Lifecycle v3
Automated Validation

        ↓

Lifecycle v4
Integrated CI

        ↓

Lifecycle v5
Reproducible Execution

        ↓

Lifecycle v6
Evidence-Driven Build Trust
```

Evolution should preserve conceptual continuity.

---

## Lifecycle Anti-Patterns

The Build Lifecycle rejects several patterns.

---

### Build Without Preparation

Starting execution before context and inputs are understood creates fragile builds.

---

### Validation Only At The End

Many failures should be detected before expensive execution.

---

### Artifact Promotion After Failed Validation

A failed artifact must not silently proceed.

---

### Hidden Post-Build Mutation

Artifacts must not be modified after validation without invalidating their trust state.

---

### Release During Build Execution

Release publication must remain a separate downstream lifecycle.

---

### Permanent Temporary State

Intermediate build outputs should not gradually become unofficial authoritative artifacts.

---

## Build Lifecycle And Developer Workflow

The build lifecycle must integrate naturally with development.

A developer workflow may include:

```text
Code Change
    ↓
Local Validation
    ↓
Local Build
    ↓
Artifact Check
    ↓
Commit
    ↓
CI Build
```

The Build Lifecycle must reinforce rather than obstruct normal engineering flow.

---

## Build Lifecycle And Testing

Tests may participate at multiple stages.

For example:

```text
Pre-Build Tests
       ↓
Build Execution
       ↓
Artifact Tests
       ↓
Integration Tests
```

The exact placement depends on build profile and test type.

Testing policy remains owned by the Testing Framework.

---

## Build Lifecycle And Quality

Quality gates may evaluate build lifecycle outcomes.

Examples include:

* validation status;
* artifact integrity;
* build failure rate;
* reproducibility;
* evidence completeness.

The Build Framework produces relevant evidence.

The Quality Framework governs broader assessment.

---

## Build Lifecycle And Release

The lifecycle ends in a controlled release handoff.

```text
Build Lifecycle
      ↓
Trusted Artifact
      ↓
Handoff
      ↓
Release Lifecycle
```

This handoff is one of the most important boundaries in FamilyOS engineering.

---

## Build Lifecycle And Continuous Improvement

Lifecycle execution generates operational knowledge.

That knowledge should feed future improvements.

```text
Build Execution
      ↓
Operational Evidence
      ↓
Analysis
      ↓
Framework Improvement
      ↓
Better Build Execution
```

This creates a self-reinforcing engineering system.

---

## Lifecycle Success Criteria

The Build Lifecycle is successful when FamilyOS can consistently determine:

1. when a build begins;
2. what build was requested;
3. which context applies;
4. whether inputs are valid;
5. whether dependencies are valid;
6. whether tools are valid;
7. whether the environment is valid;
8. which execution stages occurred;
9. which artifacts were produced;
10. whether artifacts passed validation;
11. which evidence supports the result;
12. when the build was finalized;
13. whether artifacts are trusted;
14. whether release handoff is allowed;
15. how failed builds are diagnosed;
16. how build capability is maintained and improved.

---

## Lifecycle Summary

The canonical FamilyOS Build Lifecycle can be summarized as:

```text
Design
  ↓
Prepare
  ↓
Resolve
  ↓
Validate
  ↓
Execute
  ↓
Identify
  ↓
Validate Artifacts
  ↓
Generate Evidence
  ↓
Finalize
  ↓
Handoff
  ↓
Maintain
  ↓
Improve
```

This model converts build engineering from an isolated technical action into a governed lifecycle capability.

---

## Final Lifecycle Principle

The FamilyOS Build Lifecycle is founded on the following rule:

> A build is complete only when its inputs, execution, artifacts, validation state, and resulting evidence have reached a known final state.

Execution alone does not define completion.

Artifact creation alone does not define completion.

A FamilyOS build becomes complete when the engineering system can explain what happened, what was produced, whether it was valid, and whether the result can safely progress to the next lifecycle.

This lifecycle model provides the operational foundation required for trustworthy FamilyOS build engineering.
