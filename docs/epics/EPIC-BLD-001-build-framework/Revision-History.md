# EPIC-BLD-001 — Build Framework Revision History

## Document Purpose

This document records the evolution of **EPIC-BLD-001 — Build Framework**.

It preserves the historical development, structural normalization, validation, governance, publication, and post-release revalidation context of the FamilyOS Build Framework.

The revision history distinguishes between:

* framework document versioning;
* repository publication tags;
* immutable historical release states;
* canonical structure normalization;
* control-document synchronization;
* validation evidence;
* post-release corrections;
* future framework evolution.

## Revision Principles

The Build Framework revision history follows several principles.

### Historical Integrity

Published repository states SHALL remain historically identifiable.

A historical publication tag SHALL NOT be silently moved to a later commit because documentation is corrected or revalidated after publication.

---

### Explicit Evolution

Material Build Framework changes should be recorded explicitly.

Changes affecting:

* Build Principles;
* Build Architecture;
* Build Lifecycle;
* Build Context;
* Build Inputs;
* Build Toolchain;
* Build Environments;
* Dependency Management;
* Build Configuration;
* Build Execution;
* Artifact Management;
* Build Validation;
* Build Governance;
* Build Automation;
* release handoff;

should remain traceable to an identifiable framework revision.

---

### Evidence-Based Validation

Validation state SHALL reflect actual evidence.

A validation requirement SHALL NOT be marked `PASS` solely because it is required by documentation.

Only actual execution, review, inspection, or other accepted evidence may convert a pending validation requirement into a successful result.

---

### Structural Consistency

The canonical documentation inventory SHALL remain synchronized across:

* `EPIC.yaml`;
* `MANIFEST.md`;
* `README.md`;
* `VALIDATION.md`;
* `CHANGELOG.md`;
* `Revision-History.md`;
* `EPIC-BLD-001.md`.

---

## Versioning Model

The Build Framework uses semantic versioning principles for framework evolution.

```text
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
```

Typical interpretation:

| Change                              | Expected Version Impact             |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Breaking framework semantics        | MAJOR                               |
| Compatible framework capability     | MINOR                               |
| Correction or clarification         | PATCH                               |
| Post-release metadata normalization | Usually no framework version change |
| Validation evidence refresh         | Usually no framework version change |

Version impact remains subject to FamilyOS release governance.

---

## Framework Version vs Repository Tag

The Build Framework version and repository publication tag have different responsibilities.

Framework version:

```text
1.0.0
```

Historical repository publication tag:

```text
v4.7.0-build-framework
```

These values SHALL NOT be assumed to follow the same numbering scheme.

---

## Canonical Structure History

The current canonical Build Framework structure consists of:

```text
24 numbered documents
+
7 control documents
=
31 canonical files
```

Canonical numbered range:

```text
00 → 23
```

The seven control documents are:

```text
EPIC-BLD-001.md
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

This structure represents the authoritative current documentation organization for EPIC-BLD-001.

---

## Canonical Numbered Documents

The current numbered document sequence is:

```text
00-EPIC.md
01-Context.md
02-Vision.md
03-Build-Principles.md
04-Build-Architecture.md
05-Build-Lifecycle.md
06-Build-Input-Requirements.md
07-Build-Inputs-and-Project-Structure.md
08-Build-Toolchain.md
09-Build-Environment-Management.md
10-Dependency-Management.md
11-Build-Configuration.md
12-Build-Philosophy.md
13-Build-Execution.md
14-Artifact-Management.md
15-Build-Validation.md
16-Build-Governance.md
17-Build-Automation-and-CI.md
18-Roadmap.md
19-References.md
20-Validation.md
21-Summary.md
22-Release.md
23-Implementation-Checklist.md
```

---

## Revision Timeline

### Version 1.0.0 — Build Framework Foundation

**Status:** Completed
**Historical Publication:** Published
**Historical Tag:** `v4.7.0-build-framework`

Version `1.0.0` establishes the first complete canonical FamilyOS Build Framework.

The framework defines:

* Build Principles;
* Build Architecture;
* Build Lifecycle;
* Build Input Requirements;
* Build Inputs and Project Structure;
* Build Toolchain;
* Build Environment Management;
* Dependency Management;
* Build Configuration;
* Build Philosophy;
* Build Execution;
* Artifact Management;
* Build Validation;
* Build Governance;
* Build Automation and CI;
* Roadmap;
* Validation;
* Release;
* Implementation Planning.

The framework establishes builds as controlled engineering transformations that produce validated and traceable artifacts rather than treating successful command execution as sufficient evidence of trust.

---

## Version 1.0.0 Structural Baseline

The canonical structural baseline for version `1.0.0` is:

| Category           |     Count |
| ------------------ | --------: |
| Numbered Documents |        24 |
| Control Documents  |         7 |
| Canonical Files    |        31 |
| Canonical Range    | `00 → 23` |

This structure SHALL remain authoritative unless a future governed revision explicitly changes it.

---

## Historical Publication

Version `1.0.0` was historically published under:

```text
v4.7.0-build-framework
```

Historical publication commit:

```text
1b457dd86ae4c94033fa29b96b4e6db135202171
```

The publication relationship is:

```text
Build Framework 1.0.0
        ↓
Historical Repository Publication
        ↓
v4.7.0-build-framework
```

---

## Historical Tag Immutability

The historical publication tag:

```text
v4.7.0-build-framework
```

SHALL remain immutable.

Post-release changes SHALL NOT:

* move the historical tag;
* delete and recreate the historical tag to reference a newer commit;
* reinterpret the tag as the current repository state;
* silently rewrite historical publication evidence.

Corrections after publication SHALL instead be represented by ordinary repository commits and, where required, a future governed release.

---

## Historical Build Tags

The repository may contain earlier build-related tags such as:

```text
v1.9.0-build
v2.0.0-build
v4.7.0-build-framework
```

These tags represent historical repository states.

They SHALL NOT be repurposed as aliases for the current normalized Build Framework state.

---

## Build Architecture Revision

Version `1.0.0` establishes a dedicated Build Architecture separating:

```text
Build Inputs
Build Context
Build Environment
Build Toolchain
Dependency State
Build Configuration
Build Execution
Artifact Management
Build Validation
Build Evidence
Release Handoff
```

This separation prevents Build Framework responsibilities from collapsing into a single build command or CI implementation.

---

## Build Lifecycle Revision

The framework establishes the canonical lifecycle:

```text
Build Inputs
      ↓
Build Context Resolution
      ↓
Environment Preparation
      ↓
Dependency Resolution
      ↓
Toolchain Validation
      ↓
Pre-Build Validation
      ↓
Build Execution
      ↓
Candidate Artifact Collection
      ↓
Artifact Validation
      ↓
Build Evidence Generation
      ↓
Trusted Artifact Finalization
      ↓
Release Handoff
```

This lifecycle remains a central architectural contract of the framework.

---

## Artifact Trust Revision

Version `1.0.0` establishes the distinction between:

```text
Successful Execution
Generated Output
Candidate Artifact
Validated Artifact
Trusted Artifact
```

The framework explicitly rejects the assumption that successful command execution automatically establishes artifact trust.

---

## Artifact Integrity Revision

The framework establishes that artifact integrity corresponds to the actual bytes that were validated.

Once a validated artifact is treated as trusted, modifying those bytes invalidates the previous trust state.

Downstream release workflows should prefer promotion of the exact validated bytes.

---

## Build Evidence Revision

Version `1.0.0` establishes Build Evidence as a first-class framework concept.

Evidence may include:

* source revision;
* Build ID;
* effective configuration;
* dependency state;
* environment identity;
* toolchain identity;
* execution results;
* validation results;
* artifact inventory;
* artifact digests;
* provenance;
* timestamps.

This evidence supports traceability, reproducibility, diagnostics, governance, and release handoff.

---

## Build and Release Boundary Revision

Version `1.0.0` clarifies that:

```text
Build
```

owns:

* artifact production;
* artifact validation;
* artifact trust;
* build evidence;
* build provenance;
* release handoff preparation.

Whereas:

```text
Release
```

owns:

* release planning;
* release candidates;
* release approval;
* publication;
* distribution;
* rollback;
* release lifecycle governance.

The Build Framework SHALL NOT silently absorb Release authority.

---

## Testing Boundary Revision

The framework may invoke or consume tests during build readiness.

The Testing Framework remains authoritative for:

* test architecture;
* testing levels;
* test semantics;
* test design;
* testing evidence.

Build consumes testing evidence where necessary but does not redefine testing methodology.

---

## Quality Boundary Revision

The Build Framework may consume quality evidence and invoke quality gates.

The Quality Framework remains authoritative for:

* quality policy;
* Quality Rules;
* Quality Profiles;
* Quality Assessment;
* Quality Gate semantics;
* quality governance.

---

## Documentation Boundary Revision

The Documentation Framework remains authoritative for documentation architecture and documentation standards.

Build may validate build-relevant documentation requirements without becoming the documentation governance authority.

---

## Plugin Compliance Boundary Revision

The Plugin Compliance Framework remains authoritative for plugin-specific compliance requirements.

The Build Framework may consume plugin compliance evidence when required by Build Profiles or release handoff.

---

## Automation Revision

Version `1.0.0` establishes that automation executes canonical Build Framework semantics.

The governing principle is:

> CI executes the Build Framework; CI does not define the Build Framework.

This protects Build Architecture from becoming dependent on a particular automation platform.

---

## Environment Revision

The framework establishes Build Environment identity and control as part of Build Context.

Environment differences that may affect build output or artifact trust should be identifiable and governed.

---

## Toolchain Revision

Critical Build Toolchain components should be identifiable and versioned where changes may materially affect build output or trust.

Toolchain drift SHALL NOT silently redefine build semantics.

---

## Dependency Revision

Dependencies are treated as part of effective Build Context.

Dependency resolution should support reproducibility, traceability, integrity, and governance according to risk.

---

## Configuration Revision

Build Configuration is treated as resolved engineering state.

The effective configuration should be explainable from its declared sources and precedence rules.

---

## Governance Revision

Build Governance defines how Build Framework changes are reviewed, classified, approved, and evolved.

Possible change classes include:

```text
routine
significant
architectural
strategic
```

Governance mechanisms may include:

* code review;
* documentation review;
* technical review;
* ADR;
* RFC;
* EPIC revision;
* quality review;
* security review.

---

## Roadmap Revision

The framework roadmap progresses through:

```text
Build Foundation
        ↓
Build Standardization
        ↓
Build Validation
        ↓
Build Automation
        ↓
Artifact Trust
        ↓
Reproducibility and Traceability
        ↓
Release Integration
        ↓
Supply-Chain Assurance
```

Future roadmap items do not imply current implementation.

---

## Supply-Chain Direction

The Build Framework establishes foundations for future software supply-chain assurance.

Potential future capabilities include:

* stronger provenance;
* signed build evidence;
* signed artifacts;
* dependency attestations;
* SBOM integration;
* reproducible builds;
* hermetic builds;
* protected builders;
* policy-driven supply-chain gates.

These future capabilities remain subject to later implementation and governance.

---

## Post-Release Normalization

Following historical publication, the Build Framework documentation may receive normalization changes that improve consistency without redefining the semantic identity of version `1.0.0`.

Examples include:

* machine-readable metadata normalization;
* canonical inventory synchronization;
* validation evidence correction;
* state normalization;
* control-document synchronization;
* terminology correction;
* formatting correction;
* historical-state clarification;
* stale-state removal.

Such changes do not automatically require modification of the historical publication tag.

---

## Post-Release Revalidation

A post-release revalidation is being performed against the current repository state.

The purpose of this revalidation is to verify that the current Build Framework documentation remains consistent with:

* the physical repository inventory;
* the canonical `00 → 23` structure;
* all seven control documents;
* current repository quality gates;
* framework boundaries;
* governance expectations;
* current validation evidence.

The revalidation does not rewrite historical publication history.

---

## Revalidation Scope

The current post-release revalidation includes:

```text
YAML Contract
Canonical Inventory
Filesystem Inventory
Numbering Integrity
Control Document Integrity
Empty File Detection
Reference Integrity
Semantic Consistency
Build Architecture Consistency
Build Lifecycle Consistency
Artifact Trust Consistency
Framework Boundary Review
Governance Consistency
Placeholder Review
Join Defect Review
Ruff
MyPy
Pytest
Repository Diff Validation
Historical Tag Verification
Repository State Validation
```

Only checks supported by actual evidence SHALL be marked as passed.

---

## Current Structural Evidence

The current canonical inventory is:

```text
Numbered Documents: 24
Control Documents:  7
Canonical Files:    31
Canonical Range:    00 → 23
```

The authoritative machine-readable structure is maintained in:

```text
EPIC.yaml
```

The authoritative human-readable structural inventory is maintained in:

```text
MANIFEST.md
```

---

## Current Machine-Readable State

The normalized machine-readable framework state is expected to contain:

```yaml
id: EPIC-BLD-001
version: 1.0.0
status: completed

structure:
  numbered_documents: 24
  canonical_document_range: "00-23"
  control_documents: 7
  canonical_files: 31
```

During revalidation:

```yaml
baseline:
  framework_version: 1.0.0
  documentation_status: completed
  repository_validation_status: pending_revalidation
  final_validation_status: pending_revalidation
```

These validation states SHALL remain pending until supported by actual revalidation evidence.

---

## EPIC.yaml Normalization

During post-release revalidation, `EPIC.yaml` is normalized into a dedicated machine-readable framework contract.

The normalized contract should identify:

```text
EPIC: EPIC-BLD-001
Version: 1.0.0
Status: completed
Numbered Documents: 24
Control Documents: 7
Canonical Files: 31
Historical Tag: v4.7.0-build-framework
Historical Publication: published
```

---

## MANIFEST.md Normalization

`MANIFEST.md` is synchronized with the canonical Build Framework structure.

The manifest records:

```text
24 numbered documents
7 control documents
31 canonical files
```

Its active framework state is:

```text
Status: Completed
Version: 1.0.0
```

---

## EPIC-BLD-001.md Normalization

`EPIC-BLD-001.md` is synchronized with the completed framework state.

It records:

* framework version `1.0.0`;
* status `Completed`;
* 24 numbered documents;
* seven control documents;
* 31 canonical files;
* historical publication under `v4.7.0-build-framework`;
* historical tag immutability;
* current post-release revalidation.

---

## Validation Evidence Policy

Validation evidence SHALL be revision-aware.

For example:

```text
Repository Revision A
        ↓
Ruff PASS
MyPy PASS
Pytest PASS
```

does not automatically prove:

```text
Repository Revision B
        ↓
Ruff PASS
MyPy PASS
Pytest PASS
```

when revision B contains changes that may affect those checks.

Required validation SHALL be rerun when repository changes invalidate prior evidence.

---

## Validation State Semantics

The following states apply.

### PASS

A required validation was executed successfully and acceptable evidence exists.

### FAIL

A required validation was executed and did not satisfy its acceptance criteria.

### PENDING

The validation has not yet been executed, completed, or formally evaluated against the current repository state.

### NOT APPLICABLE

The validation does not apply and that determination is justified.

No validation state SHALL move from `PENDING` to `PASS` without supporting evidence.

---

## Current Revalidation Relationship

The repository activity is represented as:

```text
Historical Publication
v4.7.0-build-framework
        ↓
Later Repository Evolution
        ↓
Build Framework Control-Document Normalization
        ↓
Post-Release Revalidation
        ↓
Current Validation Evidence
```

This preserves both historical integrity and current documentation accuracy.

---

## Revision Classification

Build Framework changes may be classified as follows.

### Editorial

Examples:

* spelling correction;
* grammar correction;
* formatting correction;
* non-semantic wording improvement.

Expected framework version impact:

```text
Usually none
```

---

### Documentation Normalization

Examples:

* control-document synchronization;
* machine-readable metadata correction;
* stale-state removal;
* canonical inventory synchronization;
* validation-record correction.

Expected framework version impact:

```text
Usually none
```

provided Build Framework semantics remain unchanged.

---

### Compatible Semantic Change

Examples:

* compatible optional Build Profile;
* compatible evidence extension;
* compatible artifact metadata extension;
* compatible governance extension.

Expected framework version impact:

```text
MINOR
```

---

### Breaking Semantic Change

Examples:

* incompatible Build Context semantics;
* incompatible artifact trust model;
* incompatible execution contract;
* incompatible release handoff contract.

Expected framework version impact:

```text
MAJOR
```

---

## Compatibility Expectations

Compatible revisions should preserve:

* Build Context semantics;
* Build Lifecycle semantics;
* artifact trust distinctions;
* Build Evidence traceability;
* Build and Release boundaries;
* deterministic Build Configuration;
* governed Build Toolchains;
* controlled Build Environments.

Breaking changes require explicit migration guidance.

---

## Governance of Revisions

Material revisions should identify:

* reason for change;
* affected documents;
* semantic impact;
* compatibility impact;
* validation requirements;
* migration requirements where applicable;
* release implications;
* downstream framework impact.

Revision governance SHALL distinguish between:

```text
Documentation Correction
Framework Clarification
Compatible Framework Evolution
Breaking Framework Evolution
Historical Publication
Post-Release Revalidation
```

---

## Historical Record Policy

This revision history SHALL preserve publication information even when later documentation improves the representation of that history.

Historical records SHOULD NOT be rewritten merely to make previous states appear identical to the current canonical state.

Where historical and current states differ, the distinction should remain explicit.

---

## Release Relationship

Build Framework revision and release governance interact as follows:

```text
Framework Change
        ↓
Revision Classification
        ↓
Validation
        ↓
Compatibility Assessment
        ↓
Release Readiness
        ↓
Publication Decision
```

The Release Framework remains authoritative for repository-wide release governance.

---

## Current Publication Relationship

The current historical relationship is:

```text
EPIC-BLD-001
Build Framework
Version 1.0.0
Status: Completed
        ↓
Historical Publication
        ↓
v4.7.0-build-framework
        ↓
Immutable Historical State
```

Current post-release normalization exists after that historical publication and SHALL NOT change the historical tag.

---

## Revalidation Completion Requirements

The current post-release revalidation may be considered complete only when:

* `EPIC.yaml` is synchronized;
* `MANIFEST.md` is synchronized;
* `README.md` is synchronized;
* `CHANGELOG.md` is synchronized;
* `VALIDATION.md` is synchronized;
* `Revision-History.md` is synchronized;
* `EPIC-BLD-001.md` is synchronized;
* canonical inventory validation passes;
* YAML parsing passes;
* numbering validation passes;
* control-document validation passes;
* reference integrity passes;
* semantic consistency review passes;
* Build Architecture review passes;
* Build Lifecycle review passes;
* artifact trust consistency passes;
* framework boundary review passes;
* governance review passes;
* required repository quality gates pass;
* historical tag integrity passes;
* current validation evidence is recorded.

---

## Future Revisions

Future Build Framework revisions may introduce:

* executable Build Context models;
* canonical Build IDs;
* standardized Build Evidence schemas;
* machine-readable Build Profiles;
* canonical build orchestration interfaces;
* stronger environment isolation;
* reproducible-build enforcement;
* hermetic builds;
* artifact attestation;
* artifact signing;
* SBOM integration;
* supply-chain provenance;
* protected builders;
* advanced build observability;
* policy-driven build gates.

Such revisions SHALL remain compatible with the framework's foundational trust model unless explicitly released as breaking changes.

---

## Dependency Reproducibility Baseline Implementation — 2026-08-13

Commit `113148e` is the first incremental technical implementation slice under the completed Build Framework documentation baseline.

It established:

* `pyproject.toml` as the canonical hand-edited source of direct dependency declarations;
* generated and committed resolved dependency state in `requirements.txt`;
* the Python 3.13 development/CI lock profile;
* pip-tools 7.6.1 as the governed resolver;
* a canonical dependency-input SHA-256 covering normalized dependency declarations;
* intentional lock regeneration through `scripts/compile_dependencies.py`;
* read-only declaration and resolved-lock freshness verification through `scripts/check_dependency_lock.py`;
* focused dependency-lock tests;
* successful fresh-environment bootstrap and dependency consistency validation.

This implementation closes dependency version-resolution reproducibility only. It does not complete CI integration, artifact reproducibility, dependency artifact integrity, provenance, SBOM generation, vulnerability scanning, or the broader Build Framework implementation.

The framework remains version `1.0.0`, and the immutable historical publication tag `v4.7.0-build-framework` remains unchanged. Historical post-release revalidation records remain authoritative for the revisions they evaluated.

---

## Canonical CI Validation Baseline Implementation — 2026-08-14

Commit `504bd19` introduced the second incremental technical implementation slice under the completed Build Framework documentation baseline, following Dependency Reproducibility.

The slice established:

* one provider-neutral canonical CI validation entry point;
* deterministic sequential execution of six mandatory validation gates;
* structured, deterministic `ci-validation.json` evidence;
* dynamic evaluation of all builtin plugins through the existing Plugin Compliance engine and explicit `official` profile;
* a thin GitHub Actions adapter using Python 3.13 and the locked dependency state;
* read-only repository permission;
* official GitHub Actions dependencies pinned by commit SHA;
* structured evidence upload with mandatory failure preservation.

The first real workflow execution exposed a missing Health documentation template. Commit `c2ed8de` corrected that defect. GitHub Actions run `31749853569` at revision `c2ed8de48822919fa69b670911ecd01a909b0732` then completed successfully and uploaded canonical evidence reporting overall `PASSED`, all six gates `PASSED`, and all seven discovered builtin plugins `COMPLIANT` under profile `official`.

This revision validates the Canonical CI Validation Baseline only. The broader Build Framework technical implementation remains in progress; build execution, candidate artifacts, artifact validation, artifact integrity, full Build Evidence, release automation, and deployment remain unimplemented.

Framework version `1.0.0`, historical publication metadata, and `v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

---

## Local Developer Workflow Reconciliation — 2026-08-14

This documentation-only revision makes the implemented local dependency and
validation workflow discoverable from the repository root.

The root `README.md` records the Python 3.13 prerequisite, isolated environment
setup, controlled `requirements.txt` bootstrap, editable installation without
dependency re-resolution or build isolation, dependency consistency and
freshness checks, intentional dependency regeneration, canonical
`familyos validation ci` execution, optional JSON evidence, and common failure
remediation.

The revision also records that the GitHub Actions workflow invokes the same
provider-neutral validation command used locally. Level 26 checklist items are
closed only where existing implementation and documentation provide direct
evidence.

Level 26 remains partial. Canonical build execution, candidate-artifact
location, artifact-related cleanup, and proof that build execution avoids
CI-only steps remain deferred until the corresponding Build Framework
capabilities are implemented.

No production code, tests, dependencies, scripts, workflow behavior, framework
version, publication metadata, or historical tag changes in this revision.

---

## Canonical Package Build First Technical Slice — 2026-08-14

This implementation revision introduces `familyos build` as the public
FamilyOS package-build entry point.

The command is wired through the established Typer interface, `CommandContext`,
application container, package-build use case, packaging port, and
subprocess-backed infrastructure adapter. The adapter invokes the standard
Python build frontend with `sys.executable`, delegates backend selection to
`pyproject.toml`, uses an application-supplied output directory, and returns
only process-level wheel and source-distribution paths.

Focused tests cover application delegation, command construction, explicit
output handling, failure normalization, CLI registration, success and failure
status, absence of publication commands, and the deliberately limited result
model. A real integration test copies current packaging inputs into a temporary
project, builds one wheel and one source distribution through the production
adapter, and verifies all tracked checkout paths remain unchanged.

The packaging repository-hygiene reconciliation removes generated egg-info
from Git authority and configures `*.egg-info/`, root `dist/`, and root `build/`
as ignored generated state. After the change is committed, setuptools may
recreate this local metadata without dirtying Git-tracked authority.
`pyproject.toml` and generated `requirements.txt` retain their respective
declaration and resolved-dependency authority.

### Post-Commit Source-Mutation Verification — 2026-08-14

After packaging repository hygiene commit `a85b5a7`, editable installation,
dependency freshness, the real canonical checkout build, and canonical
validation were executed against the checkout. Tracked Git status was clean
after each workflow; generated egg-info and root package outputs remained
ignored-only state. This direct evidence closes the Level 13
authoritative-source mutation requirement.

This reconciliation changes no build behavior and introduces no Level 14 or
later artifact semantics, validation, identity, integrity, Build Evidence, or
release capability.

### Level 14 Artifact Discovery — 2026-08-14

This incremental technical revision introduces an application-owned expected
artifact contract and discovery use case after canonical package execution.
The packaging adapter reports every direct file created or replaced by the
current execution without assigning artifact policy. Discovery requires one
wheel and one source distribution in the resolved canonical output directory,
rejects missing, duplicate, out-of-location, and unexpected current outputs,
and classifies the exact expected set as candidates.

Focused static checks and 29 targeted application, infrastructure, integration,
and CLI tests passed, including a real isolated package build through the
production discovery path. Candidate classification carries no validation,
identity, integrity, trust, Build ID, Build Evidence, release, or publication
meaning.

Level 14 remains partial because temporary and intermediate output
classification and Build ID association remain open. At that revision, CI did
not yet invoke `familyos build`. The Build Framework technical implementation
remains in progress, and framework version `1.0.0` plus historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

### CI Package Build Integration — 2026-08-14

Status: REMOTELY VERIFIED.

This revision wires the `Canonical CI Validation` workflow to invoke the
existing canonical `familyos build --output-dir dist` command after
successful validation, and to upload `dist/` as the
`familyos-package-candidates` workflow artifact only when that build
succeeds. No new Python packaging or artifact-discovery logic was added to
YAML; the workflow relies entirely on `familyos build`'s own exit code and
GitHub Actions' default per-step `success()` gating, so a failed mandatory
validation or a failed build/discovery both prevent candidate publication
without any reordering of, or weakening to, the existing validation-failure
step.

Local reproduction of the full path (`familyos validation ci` then
`familyos build --output-dir dist`) was executed against this checkout and
succeeded, matching the workflow's exact invocation.

Post-implementation remote verification on 2026-08-14 executed commit
`63693e6` in push run `31792439104`. The workflow and `validate` job succeeded,
retained `familyos-ci-validation/ci-validation.json`, and uploaded exactly:

* `familyos_cli-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl`;
* `familyos_cli-0.1.0.tar.gz`.

This evidence closes the Level 27 canonical-build and explicit
candidate-collection requirements. It introduces no new implementation and no
Level 15+ artifact validation, identity, integrity, trust, Build ID, Build
Evidence, release, or publication capability. The Build Framework technical
implementation remains in progress, and framework version `1.0.0` plus
historical publication tag `v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

### Python Package Structural Validation — 2026-08-14

This incremental technical revision adds a dedicated application-owned
structural validator after successful Artifact Discovery. The canonical build
composition passes the exact discovered candidates to that use case; it does
not rescan or glob the output directory. Execution failure skips discovery and
validation, discovery failure skips validation, and an `INVALID` structural
result fails the aggregate build.

Wheel inspection validates the filename, ZIP readability and CRC, safe and
unique member paths, exactly one top-level `.dist-info` directory, readable
core and wheel metadata, required `METADATA`, `WHEEL`, and `RECORD` files, and
structural `RECORD` rows without verifying their hashes. Source-distribution
inspection validates the filename, gzip/tar readability, safe regular members,
one package root, `PKG-INFO`, archived `pyproject.toml`, Python source presence,
and readable package metadata. Both archive formats must represent the same
name/version as the authoritative repository `pyproject.toml`.

The result model is immutable and exposes only `VALID`/`INVALID` structural
semantics with deterministic candidate-specific diagnostics. It does not mutate
candidate classification or add Artifact Identity, Artifact Integrity, trust,
provenance, Build ID, Build Evidence, release, or publication state. Archive
members are inspected through bounded in-memory decompression without filesystem
extraction; no dependency or workflow file changes occur, and Level 27 artifact
validation remains open pending direct remote CI evidence.

Level 16 remains partial: runtime and dependency metadata, complete expected
module/resource and inclusion policy, installation, import/CLI smoke, and
functional source-distribution build/install validation remain future slices.
Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

### Remote Structural-Validation Evidence — 2026-08-14

This revision records remote CI evidence only; it introduces no Level 15,
Level 17, Build Evidence, release, provenance, signing, promotion, or
deployment capability.

The `Canonical CI Validation` workflow executed commit
`c49c655837f300930fa7a6b5df1714207e71e903` (short `c49c655`, branch
`feature/bld-python-package-structural-validation`, `push` event) as GitHub
Actions run `31801029251`. The run and its `validate` job both completed with
conclusion `success`. Because the canonical `familyos build --output-dir dist`
invocation at that commit already includes Python Package Structural
Validation after successful Artifact Discovery, this success is direct remote
evidence that the mandatory structural-validation path executed, not merely
build and discovery.

The `familyos-ci-validation` artifact remained available, and
`familyos-package-candidates` was uploaded and downloaded, containing exactly
`familyos_cli-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl` and `familyos_cli-0.1.0.tar.gz` (wheel
count `1`, source-distribution count `1`).

This closes the Level 27 `Run artifact validation` checklist item. It does not
close `Generate artifact integrity data` or `Collect Build Evidence`, both of
which remain open, and it does not complete the remaining functional Level 16
checks. The run again emitted the previously recorded GitHub Actions Node.js
20 deprecation warning; that maintenance debt is unchanged and is not
duplicated here, and it does not affect the run's `success` conclusion.
Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

### Python Package Content and Metadata Validation — 2026-08-14

This incremental technical revision extends the existing application-owned
Python package validator without changing the canonical execution, discovery,
and validation sequence. Emitted wheel `METADATA` and source-distribution
`PKG-INFO` must contain standards-compliant `Requires-Python` and
`Requires-Dist` fields matching normalized `pyproject.toml` authority. The
archived source-distribution `pyproject.toml` must represent the same static
metadata contract.

Configured setuptools package discovery and regular package source define the
Python-module inventory. Non-code resource intent is independently derived from
regular source files matching the exact `tool.setuptools.package-data` policy;
mere source-tree presence does not make a resource expected. Both candidates
must contain the complete expected inventory and no unintended package content;
the source distribution additionally rejects unrelated distribution-root
content. The packaging configuration now explicitly includes `py.typed`,
builtin plugin YAML manifests, and Jinja templates. This both corrects the
missing-resource defect proven by the initial source-to-candidate comparison
and prevents undeclared source resources from becoming circular authority.

PEP 440/508 parsing uses the explicitly declared `packaging>=26.0` runtime
dependency, and the generated dependency lock records that direct authority.
This revision closes only the six remaining static Level 16 metadata/content
items. Installation, import and CLI smoke, and functional source-distribution
build/install validation remain open. No CI workflow, Artifact Identity,
Artifact Integrity, Build ID, Build Evidence, trust, provenance, signing,
release, or publication capability is introduced. Framework version `1.0.0`
and immutable historical publication tag `v4.7.0-build-framework` remain
unchanged.

### Python Package Functional Validation — 2026-08-14

This incremental technical revision adds an explicit functional-validation
option to the existing package-build application sequence. It does not alter
Build Execution, Artifact Discovery, or static package validation. Only after
those stages succeed does the application pass the exact discovered wheel
candidate through `PythonWheelFunctionalValidatorPort` to the temporary-venv
infrastructure adapter.

The fresh environment has no system site packages or editable checkout
installation. Runtime dependencies are selected from wheel metadata and
constrained by the committed dependency lock. Smoke execution removes inherited
`PYTHONPATH`, uses a working directory outside the checkout, imports
`familyos_cli.main` with isolated-mode venv Python, verifies the resolved module
path is inside that venv and outside repository `src/`, and invokes the installed
`familyos --help` entry point. The environment is removed deterministically.

This revision closes only the three Level 16 wheel functional checks:
clean-environment installation, import smoke, and CLI smoke. Functional source-
distribution build/install validation remains open. The option is local
capability evidence, not a new remote CI execution claim; the workflow is
unchanged. No Artifact Identity, Build ID, Artifact Integrity, digest, Build
Evidence, provenance, trust, signing, release, publication, promotion, or
deployment semantics are introduced. Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable
historical publication tag `v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

### Python Source Distribution Rebuildability — 2026-08-14

This incremental technical revision makes the established canonical package-
construction route explicit. Production continues to invoke pypa/build without
distribution flags, causing the frontend to emit the source distribution and
then build the wheel from that exact archive in isolated temporary build state.
`build>=1.5` is now direct development dependency authority because FamilyOS
repository build infrastructure invokes it; canonical dependency compilation
keeps the resolved `build==1.5.0` lock version unchanged.

A behavioral integration negative control copies the project into temporary
authority, uses `MANIFEST.in` to omit `src/familyos_cli/__init__.py`, and adds a
test-only construction guard requiring that file. Direct wheel construction
from checkout succeeds. Canonical construction emits the source distribution
and then fails during the wheel-from-sdist step, proving that checkout source is
not substituted. The real positive path continues to discover and statically
validate one source distribution and its derived wheel; opt-in installed-wheel
functional validation also remains successful.

This revision closes the final Level 16 requirement with source-distribution
rebuildability semantics. It does not establish byte-for-byte reproducibility,
and isolated backend dependency/network determinism remains separate work. No
CI workflow, Artifact Identity, Build ID, Artifact Integrity, digest, Build
Evidence, provenance, trust, signing, release, publication, promotion, or
deployment semantics are introduced. Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable
historical publication tag `v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

### Isolated Build-Backend Dependency Version Determinism — 2026-08-14

This incremental revision constrains the versions of dependencies requested by
pypa/build's isolated PEP 517 environments. `PythonPackageBuilder` resolves the
committed `requirements.txt` under its authoritative project root and forwards
that absolute path with `--dependency-constraints-txt`. The frontend still runs
with isolation enabled, emits the sdist first, and builds the wheel from that
exact archive without an additional build stage or distribution flag.

Behavioral integration evidence records a deliberately constrained backend
dependency version inside both temporary artifacts. The sdist therefore proves
the first isolated environment consumed the constraint, and the derived wheel
proves the second isolated environment consumed it. An unconstrained control
records a different resolver-selected version, preventing the test from
passing if pypa/build ignores the production constraint argument. Existing
checkout-versus-sdist fallback evidence remains successful.

The complete lock is not installed into either environment: pip constraints
affect only dependencies that are requested. The lock is not an allowlist, and
dependencies absent from it may resolve normally. Network/cache dependence,
offline capability, toolchain identity, and byte-for-byte reproducibility
remain outside this revision. Level 11 and Level 40 remain open; Level 16 stays
complete. No CI workflow, Artifact Identity, Build ID, Artifact Integrity,
Build Manifest, Build Evidence, provenance, signing, release, publication,
promotion, or deployment semantics are introduced. Framework version `1.0.0`
and immutable historical publication tag `v4.7.0-build-framework` remain
unchanged.


### Minimal Build Context — Source Revision Capture — 2026-08-15

This incremental revision introduces the first concrete source-state component
of Build Context. An immutable application `SourceState` records the observed
Git revision and relevant working-tree dirty state, while
`SourceStateProviderPort` keeps repository inspection outside application
orchestration. `GitSourceStateProvider` is the infrastructure implementation.

Repository discovery requires the resolved Git top-level directory to equal the
resolved configured project root exactly. `RunPackageBuildUseCase` captures the
observation once before build execution and `CanonicalPackageBuildResult`
retains it through success and failure paths.

A real canonical FamilyOS build captured
`169b0141a28ce997aca1b765014ebf12587ebfbb`, exactly matching independently
queried `HEAD`, correctly reported the already-dirty pre-build checkout, emitted
two candidate artifacts successfully, and left tracked checkout state
unchanged.

Local validation passed Ruff, MyPy across 1183 source files, 123 build-slice
tests, and the controlled full suite of 1561 tests. Plain pytest continues to
expose the unrelated pre-existing top-level `scripts` import-path collection
issue under importlib mode.

This revision closes only the Level 5 source-revision and relevant
working-tree-state capture items. It does not complete the minimum Build Context
model and does not establish canonical repository/source identity, Build ID,
Artifact Identity, Artifact Integrity, Build Manifest, Build Evidence, or
provenance. Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.


### Minimal Build Identity — 2026-08-15

This incremental revision introduces executable Build Identity for canonical
package builds.

`BuildId` is an immutable UUID-backed application value object.
`BuildIdGenerator` produces UUID version 4 identifiers by default and supports
deterministic factories for tests. `RunPackageBuildUseCase` generates exactly
one identifier before source-state observation and package execution and
propagates it through `CanonicalPackageBuildResult` on success and failure
paths.

Canonical local development builds receive Build IDs under the same semantics
as CI and release-candidate executions. The FamilyOS Build ID is
provider-neutral and does not adopt a CI-provider run identifier as its logical
identity. Distinct executions from identical source state therefore remain
independently correlatable.

The canonical CLI exposes the identifier for diagnostics. Local evidence
includes UUID4 format verification, distinct identifiers across separate real
canonical executions, successful functional package validation, Ruff, MyPy
across 1186 source files, the full canonical suite of 1561 tests, and all six
canonical repository validation gates.

This revision closes the implemented Level 6 items for Build ID semantics,
generation, local-build policy, diagnostic exposure, provider-neutral identity,
format documentation, and generation/propagation testing. Association with a
complete Build Context, artifacts, structured validation results, and Build
Evidence remains open.

No Artifact Manifest, Artifact Integrity, provenance, signing, release,
publication, promotion, or deployment semantics are established. Framework
version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.


### Minimal Artifact Identity — 2026-08-16

This incremental revision introduces explicit Artifact Identity for
structurally valid canonical package candidates.

Structural validation now exposes validated `PackageIdentity` metadata only
when candidate package metadata satisfies the authoritative project package
contract. `BuildArtifactIdentitiesUseCase` combines that validated package
identity with the canonical Build ID, pre-build source revision, semantic
artifact type, artifact path, and observed filesystem size.

`ArtifactIdentity` is intentionally distinct from `DiscoveredArtifact`.
Discovery remains responsible only for identifying candidate outputs, while
identity metadata is constructed after successful structural validation.
`ArtifactClass` is shared through a neutral artifact-type module so both
concepts use the same semantic classification without introducing a dependency
cycle.

Real canonical builds produced exactly two identities, covering the wheel and
source distribution. Local evidence includes 90 targeted tests, Ruff, MyPy
across 1191 source files, the full canonical suite of 1561 tests, all six
canonical repository validation gates, real package construction, functional
validation, Build ID/source-revision association, artifact path/size checks,
and explicit discovery-boundary verification.

This revision implements candidate-artifact Build ID association for the
current Level 14 candidate model and the non-cryptographic Artifact Identity
portion of Level 15. Cryptographic digest remains open for subsequent Artifact
Integrity work.

No Artifact Manifest, Build Evidence, provenance, signing, release,
publication, promotion, or deployment semantics are established. Framework
version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.


### Minimal Artifact Integrity — 2026-08-16

This incremental revision introduces the first explicit cryptographic integrity
layer for canonical FamilyOS package artifacts.

After successful structural validation and Artifact Identity construction,
`BuildArtifactIntegritiesUseCase` calculates integrity metadata for the exact
validated candidate artifacts. `ArtifactIntegrityService` uses SHA-256 over the
artifact file stream and supports verification of current artifact bytes
against the recorded digest.

The canonical package-build result now carries Artifact Integrity records on
both successful static-only and functional-validation paths. The integrity
model remains separate from Artifact Identity and Artifact Discovery,
preserving the existing build-stage boundaries.

Real execution evidence produced and verified SHA-256 records for both the
Python wheel and source distribution. Independent digest calculation matched
the recorded value. A same-size one-byte mutation of a copied wheel failed
verification against the original digest, while explicit recalculation
established a different valid digest for the modified bytes.

Local evidence includes 29 targeted Artifact Integrity/build tests, Ruff, MyPy
across 1195 source files, the full canonical suite of 1561 tests, all six
canonical repository validation gates, a real functional canonical build,
independent SHA-256 verification, and controlled mutation detection.

This revision closes the Level 15 cryptographic-digest item and implements the
minimal digest-calculation and verification foundation of Level 17. Build
Evidence recording, automation-stage transfer verification, lifecycle-enforced
recalculation after intentional mutation, and automatic invalidation of
previous validation state after byte modification remain open.

No Artifact Manifest, Build Evidence, provenance, signing, release,
publication, promotion, or deployment semantics are established.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.


### Minimal Artifact Manifest — 2026-08-21

This incremental revision introduces the first explicit structured Artifact
Manifest for canonical FamilyOS package builds.

After successful structural validation, Artifact Identity construction, and
Artifact Integrity calculation, `BuildArtifactManifestUseCase` constructs an
immutable manifest for the exact canonical artifact set.

The manifest records the canonical Build ID and deterministic artifact metadata
including logical name, artifact type, version, size, path, digest algorithm,
digest, and structural validation state. It does not recalculate established
identity or integrity information.

Completeness validation rejects duplicate artifact paths, mismatched artifact
sets between integrity and structural validation, Build ID inconsistencies, and
artifact-type inconsistencies.

Real execution evidence produced a two-entry manifest for the Python wheel and
source distribution. Each entry matched its established Artifact Identity and
Artifact Integrity metadata, carried SHA-256 integrity data, reported structural
state `valid`, and referenced an artifact whose filesystem size matched the
manifest record.

Local evidence includes nine focused manifest-generation tests, 24 related
Artifact Identity/Integrity/build tests, Ruff, MyPy across 1198 source files,
the full canonical suite of 1561 tests, all six canonical repository validation
gates, and a real functional canonical build.

This revision implements Level 18 except for association of the manifest with
Build Evidence, which remains open.

No serialized manifest artifact, Build Evidence bundle, provenance, signing,
trust, release, publication, promotion, or deployment semantics are established.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.


### Build Validation Orchestration — 2026-08-21

This incremental revision introduces the first explicit Build Validation
orchestration layer for canonical FamilyOS package builds.

The new application-owned model defines validation profiles, domains,
requirement classifications, statuses, normalized check results, and aggregate
Build Validation results.

`BuildValidationCheckFactory` maps established canonical package-build results
into execution, artifact discovery, artifact structural validation, artifact
metadata, artifact integrity, and functional-artifact checks.

`BuildValidationOrchestrator` applies explicit decision semantics. Failed or
skipped required checks block validation. Optional failures remain observable
without failing the aggregate decision, while informational failures remain
non-blocking.

The result preserves Build ID, validation profile, ordered checks, diagnostics,
required failures, and optional warnings.

Focused evidence includes 15 Build Validation tests covering required,
optional, informational, and skipped behavior; canonical check ordering;
domain mapping; missing build-stage results; profile and Build ID preservation;
diagnostics; and a real canonical functional package build mapped to six
passing checks.

This revision implements the current Level 19 execution, artifact, metadata,
integrity, functional-artifact, mandatory-versus-optional, overall-decision,
diagnostics, and validation-test-suite responsibilities.

Input, configuration, dependency, toolchain, environment, and Build Evidence
validation remain open.

No Build Evidence ownership, release authority, provenance, signing,
publication, promotion, or deployment semantics are established.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.


### Build Dependency Validation Integration — 2026-08-21

This incremental revision integrates existing canonical dependency validation
results into Build Validation orchestration.

The established `dependency-freshness` and `dependency-consistency` canonical
CI gates remain the authoritative executors of dependency controls.
Build Validation consumes their `GateResult` values through
`BuildValidationCheckFactory.from_dependency_validation()` and does not
re-execute or duplicate their underlying logic.

Both gates map to required `DEPENDENCY` Build Validation checks. Canonical
`PASSED` maps to Build Validation `PASSED`; canonical `FAILED` and `ERROR` map
to blocking Build Validation `FAILED`. Diagnostics are preserved, while
unrelated canonical gates are explicitly rejected.

Focused evidence includes successful dependency mapping, freshness and
consistency failure mapping, canonical gate error mapping, diagnostic
preservation, unrelated-gate rejection, 20 passing targeted Build Validation
tests, and a real canonical CI validation run whose two dependency gates mapped
to an aggregate Build Validation `PASSED` decision.

This revision closes the current Level 19 dependency-validation item.

Input, configuration, toolchain, environment, and Build Evidence validation
remain open.

No dependency-resolution ownership, Build Evidence, release authority,
provenance, signing, publication, promotion, or deployment semantics are
established.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.


### Build Toolchain Validation Integration — 2026-08-21

This incremental revision adds explicit Build Toolchain validation to the
Build Validation orchestration layer.

`BuildValidationCheckFactory.from_toolchain_validation()` converts established
toolchain observations into required checks for the active Python runtime and
availability of the Python `build` module used by canonical package
construction.

Focused evidence covers successful mapping, incompatible Python, unavailable
build tooling, diagnostic preservation, aggregate failure behavior, and a real
probe of the current canonical toolchain.

The real environment reported Python 3.13.7 and `build` 1.5.0. Both required
toolchain checks passed and produced an aggregate Build Validation `PASSED`
decision.

This revision closes the current Level 19 toolchain-validation item.

Input, configuration, environment, and Build Evidence validation remain open.

Ruff, MyPy, and Pytest remain existing canonical validation gates and are not
reclassified as Build Toolchain checks.

No Build Evidence, release authority, provenance, signing, publication,
promotion, or deployment semantics are established.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.


### Build Environment Validation Integration — 2026-08-21

This incremental revision adds explicit Build Environment validation to the
Build Validation orchestration layer.

`BuildValidationCheckFactory.from_environment_validation()` converts
established environment observations into required checks for canonical
project-root availability and build-output environment usability.

Focused evidence covers successful mapping, unavailable project root,
unavailable output environment, diagnostic preservation, aggregate failure
behavior, and a real filesystem probe.

The real environment probe confirmed the repository project root and a writable
temporary build-output directory. A write/read/delete probe succeeded, both
required environment checks passed, and the aggregate Build Validation decision
was `PASSED`.

This revision closes the current Level 19 environment-validation item.

Input, configuration, and Build Evidence validation remain open.

No new build execution, filesystem ownership, Build Evidence, release
authority, provenance, signing, publication, promotion, or deployment semantics
are established.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.


### Build Input Validation Integration — 2026-08-21

This incremental revision adds explicit Build Input validation to the Build
Validation orchestration layer.

`BuildValidationCheckFactory.from_input_validation()` converts established
canonical package-build request observations into required checks for the
requested output path and functional-validation option.

Focused evidence covers successful mapping, invalid output-path input, invalid
functional-validation input, diagnostic preservation, aggregate failure
behavior, and a real canonical input probe.

The real probe confirmed the canonical `dist` output input and both valid
boolean functional-validation modes. Both required input checks passed and the
aggregate Build Validation decision was `PASSED`.

This revision closes the current Level 19 input-validation item.

Configuration and Build Evidence validation remain open.

No filesystem ownership, environment validation, Build Evidence, release
authority, provenance, signing, publication, promotion, or deployment semantics
are established.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.


### Build Configuration Validation Integration — 2026-08-21

This incremental revision adds explicit Build Configuration validation to the
Build Validation orchestration layer.

`BuildValidationCheckFactory.from_configuration_validation()` converts
established canonical configuration observations into required checks for the
authoritative package/build configuration and dependency-constraint
configuration.

Focused evidence covers successful mapping, invalid package configuration,
invalid dependency configuration, diagnostic preservation, aggregate failure
behavior, and a real canonical configuration probe.

The real probe confirmed project name `familyos-cli`, version `0.1.0`, Python
requirement `>=3.13`, build backend `setuptools.build_meta`, and availability of
the canonical `requirements.txt`. Both required configuration checks passed and
the aggregate Build Validation decision was `PASSED`.

This revision closes the current Level 19 configuration-validation item.

Build Evidence validation remains open.

No dependency validation ownership, Build Evidence, release authority,
provenance, signing, publication, promotion, or deployment semantics are
established.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.


### Minimum Build Evidence Integration — 2026-08-21

This incremental revision introduces concrete minimum Build Evidence.

`BuildEvidence` now aggregates the canonical Build ID, source state, Build
Validation result, artifact manifest, and artifact integrity records associated
with one build.

`BuildEvidenceFactory` assembles those authorities directly from
`CanonicalPackageBuildResult` and `BuildValidationResult` without regenerating
identity, source state, digests, or manifest information.

Consistency invariants require common Build IDs and require each artifact
integrity record to correspond to an artifact represented by the manifest.

Focused tests cover evidence authority preservation, source revision,
validation profile, Build ID consistency, manifest consistency, source-revision
requirements, foreign integrity records, manifest/integrity correspondence,
and factory construction.

A real canonical package build produced coherent Build Evidence with a common
Build ID, captured source revision, passing validation result, two artifact
manifest entries, and two SHA-256 integrity records.

This revision closes the initial Level 24 Build ID, source revision, profile,
validation result, artifact manifest, and artifact digest items. It also closes
the Level 17 digest-to-Build-Evidence association and Level 18
manifest-to-Build-Evidence association.

Target, runtime version, critical tool versions, effective configuration
summary, and all mature evidence capabilities remain open.

No provenance, signing, release authority, publication, promotion, deployment,
or reproducibility semantics are established.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.


### Build Evidence Validation Integration — 2026-08-21

This incremental revision integrates concrete Build Evidence into Build
Validation.

`BuildValidationCheckFactory.from_evidence_validation()` now produces a
required `EVIDENCE` check from an established `BuildEvidence` aggregate.

Missing evidence and evidence associated with another Build ID are blocking
failures. Coherent Build Evidence associated with the current validation Build
ID produces a passing required check.

Focused tests cover successful evidence mapping, missing evidence, mismatched
Build IDs, and aggregate failure behavior.

A real canonical package build was validated, converted into `BuildEvidence`,
mapped to a required passing evidence check, and combined with the existing
package-build validation checks. The resulting final Build Validation decision
was `PASSED`.

This revision closes the final open item in Level 19 — Build Validation
Orchestration.

No release authority, publication, promotion, signing, provenance, or
deployment semantics are established.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.


### CI Build Evidence Collection — 2026-08-22

This incremental revision completes the remaining CI Foundation evidence
capabilities.

The canonical package-build CLI now supports `--evidence-output` and writes
deterministic JSON Build Evidence assembled from established build,
validation, manifest, integrity, and source-state authorities.

The GitHub Actions workflow now uploads this evidence separately as
`familyos-build-evidence`.

Remote run `32574446181` completed successfully for commit
`794907e7b3b2fc5b3cdfb04da148a56bf15a0167`.

Downloaded Build Evidence matched the executed source revision, contained a
passing CI validation result, two artifact manifest entries, and two SHA-256
artifact integrity records whose digests matched the manifest.

The captured source state reported `dirty: true`. This observation is preserved
as evidence and does not introduce clean-tree enforcement into the CI
Foundation.

This revision closes `Generate artifact integrity data` and
`Collect Build Evidence`, completing Level 27 — CI Foundation.

No release authority, publication, promotion, signing, provenance, or
deployment semantics are established.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.


### Local Developer Cleanup Completion — 2026-08-22

This incremental revision completes the remaining Local Developer Workflow
cleanup documentation.

The repository root `README.md` now defines the canonical cleanup procedure for
implemented derived local state, including the virtual environment, package
output directories, generated packaging metadata, and known validation/tool
caches.

The procedure explicitly protects authoritative repository source,
configuration, dependency definitions, tracked generated derivatives, and
other controlled state.

No dedicated `familyos clean` command is introduced.

This revision closes `Document cleanup` and completes Level 26 — Local
Developer Workflow at 10/10.

Broader execution failure cleanup, temporary/intermediate artifact lifecycle,
release retention, and downstream artifact handling remain owned by their
respective implementation levels.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.


### Artifact Output Classification Completion — 2026-08-22

This incremental revision completes the remaining Artifact Discovery
classification work.

`ArtifactOutputClassification` now defines `TEMPORARY`, `INTERMEDIATE`, and
`CANDIDATE` lifecycle roles independently from `ArtifactClass`.

The canonical Python package discovery path continues to expose only the final
wheel and source distribution as candidate artifacts. Temporary and
intermediate roles are explicitly representable without being falsely inferred
from outputs not exposed by the current builder.

Focused tests validate all three roles and confirm that canonical package
discovery emits candidate outputs only.

This revision closes `Distinguish temporary output` and `Distinguish
intermediate output`, completing Level 14 — Artifact Discovery at 11/11.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.


### Artifact Integrity Lifecycle Completion — 2026-08-22

This incremental revision completes Level 17 — Artifact Integrity.

The application-owned `MutateArtifactUseCase` now formalizes intentional
artifact byte mutation. The transition preserves logical artifact context,
refreshes material Artifact Identity metadata, and recalculates SHA-256
Artifact Integrity from the mutated bytes.

Previously recorded integrity is invalid after byte modification, while the
fresh integrity verifies the new bytes.

Mutation results intentionally carry no prior validation or trust state.
Mutated artifacts therefore require fresh validation before downstream
validated-artifact semantics can be re-established.

Artifact integrity verification after automation-stage transfer was also
demonstrated against remotely produced CI artifacts and canonical Build
Evidence.

This revision closes the final two Level 17 items and completes Artifact
Integrity at 7/7.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.


### Artifact Manifest Completion Reconciliation — 2026-08-22

This incremental revision reconciles Level 18 — Artifact Manifest with the
subsequently implemented Build Evidence association.

`BuildEvidenceFactory` now requires an established Artifact Manifest and
includes it in immutable `BuildEvidence`.

`BuildEvidence` enforces matching Build IDs between itself and the manifest and
requires each Artifact Integrity record to be represented by an equivalent
manifest entry.

The earlier Minimal Artifact Manifest revision remains historically accurate:
at that point in the implementation sequence, Build Evidence association had
not yet been introduced. The later Minimum Build Evidence integration closed
that remaining gap.

No new Artifact Manifest production capability is introduced by this
documentation reconciliation.

Level 18 — Artifact Manifest is complete at 11/11.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

### Level 13.2 — Current Execution Contract Reconciliation — 2026-08-24

This documentation-only revision reconciles Level 13 — Build Execution with the
canonical package-build behavior implemented after the original Level 13
packaging slice.

The current application-owned orchestration validates canonical inputs,
repository layout, toolchain, environment, and effective configuration before
significant packaging execution.

It resolves immutable Build Context, delegates packaging through the
package-builder port, discovers the exact package candidate set, performs
structural package validation, establishes Artifact Identity, Artifact
Integrity, and Artifact Manifest, and optionally performs wheel functional
validation.

Mandatory dependent failures propagate through the canonical package-build
result rather than being silently converted into successful execution.

The current CLI exposes the canonical package-build entry point and reports
Build ID, effective profile and target, runtime and environment observations,
critical toolchain versions, output and evidence configuration, candidate
outputs, validation outcomes, and diagnostics where available.

This existing result and console visibility does not constitute canonical
execution-stage observability.

The implementation does not yet define structured execution-stage records,
stage-event history, stage timestamps, stage durations, per-stage tool
invocation records, retry history, cancellation state, or a canonical execution
trace.

Accordingly, the open Level 13 execution-stage and execution-stage logging
requirements remain open for subsequent Canonical Execution Observability work.

No production code or runtime behavior changes in this reconciliation.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

---

### Level 13.3 — Canonical Execution Observability — 2026-08-24

This revision implements canonical execution-stage observability for the
application-owned FamilyOS package-build orchestration.

The canonical execution model now defines thirteen explicit stages spanning
validated inputs through optional wheel functional validation.

The implemented stages are:

```text
VALIDATE_INPUTS
VALIDATE_REPOSITORY_LAYOUT
VALIDATE_TOOLCHAIN
VALIDATE_ENVIRONMENT
RESOLVE_BUILD_CONTEXT
VALIDATE_EFFECTIVE_CONFIGURATION
PACKAGE
DISCOVER_ARTIFACTS
VALIDATE_ARTIFACTS
ESTABLISH_ARTIFACT_IDENTITY
ESTABLISH_ARTIFACT_INTEGRITY
BUILD_ARTIFACT_MANIFEST
FUNCTIONALLY_VALIDATE_WHEEL
```

Each reached stage produces an immutable `BuildExecutionObservation` containing
its canonical stage identifier, terminal `SUCCEEDED` or `FAILED` status,
elapsed monotonic duration, and an optional diagnostic.

Execution observations are preserved in orchestration order on
`CanonicalPackageBuildResult`.

Successful package builds without requested functional validation record twelve
stages. When functional validation is requested and reached,
`FUNCTIONALLY_VALIDATE_WHEEL` is recorded as the thirteenth and final stage.

Mandatory failures remain fail-fast. The failing stage is retained with
`FAILED`, and later dependent stages are not reported as executed.

The canonical CLI renders the application-owned execution observations in
order, including stage identifier, status, duration, and diagnostic when
available.

Unit coverage validates the immutable observation model, canonical result
compatibility, ordered successful execution, package-stage failure propagation,
optional functional validation, and CLI rendering.

This revision closes the Level 13 checklist items:

* Define build execution stages.
* Add execution-stage logging.

Workspace initialization, staging, generation-stage definition, execution
finalization, partial-output handling, cleanup, cancellation, and retry policy
remain open.

This revision does not introduce stage start or end timestamps, per-stage tool
invocation records, retry history, cancellation history, Build Evidence
semantics, artifact trust semantics, release behavior, publication behavior, or
a general-purpose distributed execution trace.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

---

### Level 13.4 — Canonical Build Workspace Initialization — 2026-08-24

This revision introduces canonical Build Workspace initialization for the
application-owned package-build orchestration.

After successful environment validation and before Build Context resolution,
FamilyOS now initializes an isolated workspace derived from the validated
temporary-directory capability and canonical Build ID.

The canonical workspace layout is:

```text
<temporary-directory>/
└── familyos-build/
    └── <build-id>/
        ├── staging/
        └── intermediate/
```

The immutable `BuildWorkspace` model represents that layout.

`BuildWorkspaceInitializer` owns filesystem initialization and rejects reuse
of an existing Build-ID workspace.

The canonical execution-stage vocabulary now contains fourteen stages through
optional wheel functional validation, with `INITIALIZE_WORKSPACE` inserted
between `VALIDATE_ENVIRONMENT` and `RESOLVE_BUILD_CONTEXT`.

Successful execution without functional validation therefore records thirteen
ordered stage observations. Requested functional validation adds
`FUNCTIONALLY_VALIDATE_WHEEL` as the fourteenth and final stage when reached.

Workspace initialization failures remain fail-fast. The failed
`INITIALIZE_WORKSPACE` observation retains its diagnostic and prevents Build
Context resolution, effective-configuration validation, packaging, Artifact
Discovery, and later dependent operations.

The workspace initializer receives the Build ID generated for the canonical
execution and reuses the temporary directory already captured and validated in
the canonical `EnvironmentState`.

The Python package builder remains intentionally unchanged: authoritative
`project_root` remains the PyPA build source and candidate distributions remain
written to the canonical output directory.

This revision closes the Level 13 checklist item:

* Define workspace initialization.

Staging behavior, generation stages, package assembly, execution finalization,
partial-output handling, failure cleanup, cancellation semantics, and retry
policy remain open.

The presence of a `staging` directory establishes workspace structure only and
does not claim implementation of staging behavior.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

---

### Level 13.5 — Canonical Build Input Staging — 2026-08-24

This revision introduces canonical build-input staging for the
application-owned FamilyOS package-build orchestration.

After successful effective-configuration validation and before package
execution, FamilyOS now materializes the canonical package-build input set
inside the Build-ID-scoped workspace.

The staged project layout is:

```text
<workspace-root>/
├── staging/
│   └── project/
└── intermediate/
```

`BuildInputStager` owns staging from authoritative project source.

The immutable `StagedBuildInputs` model represents the staged project root.

The current staging contract materializes the root packaging inputs and the
`src/familyos_cli` package tree required by the FamilyOS CLI package build,
while excluding unrelated repository state and Python cache state.

Canonical staging is represented explicitly by the `STAGE_BUILD_INPUTS`
execution stage.

The canonical execution-stage vocabulary now contains fifteen stages through
optional wheel functional validation, with `STAGE_BUILD_INPUTS` inserted
between `VALIDATE_EFFECTIVE_CONFIGURATION` and `PACKAGE`.

Successful execution without requested functional validation therefore
records fourteen ordered stage observations. Requested functional validation
adds `FUNCTIONALLY_VALIDATE_WHEEL` as the fifteenth and final stage when
reached.

Staging failure is fail-fast. A failed `STAGE_BUILD_INPUTS` observation
retains its diagnostic and prevents package execution, Artifact Discovery,
package validation, artifact identity establishment, artifact integrity
establishment, manifest construction, and functional validation.

Staging does not mutate authoritative project source.

The canonical Python package builder intentionally remains unchanged and
continues to consume authoritative `project_root` directly. The staged
project is therefore not yet the effective PyPA package source.

This revision closes the Level 13 checklist item:

* Define staging behavior.

Generation-stage definition, package assembly, execution finalization,
partial-output handling, failure cleanup, cancellation semantics, and retry
policy remain open.

This revision does not introduce Build Evidence, artifact trust, release,
publication, cleanup, cancellation, retry, or distributed tracing semantics.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

---

### Level 13.6 — Canonical Generation Requirement Resolution — 2026-08-24

This revision resolves generation-stage requirements for the current canonical
FamilyOS CLI package-build target.

The current package build does not require a dedicated generation stage before
package assembly.

Its authoritative package inputs are already materialized before canonical
execution. The generated dependency lock `requirements.txt` is governed as a
controlled build input, and its freshness against canonical dependency
declarations in `pyproject.toml` is validated before staging.

The broader FamilyOS repository contains dedicated project, domain,
documentation, and artifact-generation capabilities. Audit confirms that those
generation subsystems are not coupled to the current canonical package-build
orchestration.

No `GENERATE` execution stage is therefore introduced merely to satisfy a
generic lifecycle vocabulary.

The absence of a generation stage for the current package target is an explicit
target-specific execution decision.

Future build targets that require generated source, schemas, manifests,
metadata, documentation, resources, or other derived package inputs must
define explicit generation semantics, including generator identity,
authoritative source inputs, destination, ordering, freshness or regeneration
behavior, validation, and failure propagation.

This revision closes the Level 13 checklist item:

* Define generation stages where needed.

The canonical execution vocabulary remains unchanged at fifteen stages through
optional wheel functional validation.

Package assembly, execution finalization, partial-output handling, failure
cleanup, cancellation semantics, and retry policy remain open.

This revision introduces no production-code behavior and does not introduce
Build Evidence, artifact trust, release, publication, cleanup, cancellation,
retry, or distributed tracing semantics.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

---

### Level 13.7 — Canonical Package Assembly — 2026-08-24

This revision makes the isolated staged project the effective package source for the canonical FamilyOS CLI package build.

After successful canonical input staging, the `PACKAGE` execution stage now passes `StagedBuildInputs.project_root` to `PythonPackageBuilder` rather than authoritative `project_root`.

The resolved canonical output directory remains unchanged and independent from the temporary Build-ID-scoped workspace.

Application tests validate staged-root consumption and output-directory preservation.

Real PyPA validation from the staged snapshot succeeds with exactly one wheel and one source distribution while leaving tracked authoritative project source unchanged.

This revision closes the Level 13 checklist item:

* Define package assembly.

The canonical execution vocabulary remains unchanged at fifteen stages through optional wheel functional validation.

Execution finalization, partial-output handling, failure cleanup, cancellation semantics, and retry policy remain open.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag `v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

---

### Level 13.8 — Canonical Execution Finalization — 2026-08-24

This revision introduces the canonical terminal finalization boundary for
FamilyOS package-build execution.

`BuildExecutionStage` now contains sixteen canonical stages, with
`FINALIZE_EXECUTION` as the terminal stage.

All fourteen current terminal return paths in
`RunPackageBuildUseCase.execute()` are routed through the centralized
`_finalize_result()` boundary.

The terminal execution flow is:

    Last Reached Business Stage
            ↓
    FINALIZE_EXECUTION
            ↓
    CanonicalPackageBuildResult

Finalization records successful establishment of the terminal execution result
without overwriting or reinterpreting the underlying build outcome.

A failed business stage therefore remains failed and retains its diagnostic,
while the subsequent `FINALIZE_EXECUTION` observation is recorded as
`SUCCEEDED`.

Successful execution without requested functional validation records fifteen
ordered observations.

Successful execution with functional validation records sixteen ordered
observations, with `FUNCTIONALLY_VALIDATE_WHEEL` immediately preceding
`FINALIZE_EXECUTION`.

Application validation covers:

* successful terminal finalization;
* functional-validation terminal ordering;
* failed package execution finalization;
* deterministic stage-duration observation;
* workspace-initialization failure preservation;
* build-input-staging failure preservation;
* centralized routing of all fourteen current terminal returns.

This revision closes the Level 13 checklist item:

* Define execution finalization.

The following Level 13 concerns remain open:

* Define partial-output handling.
* Define failure cleanup.
* Define cancellation semantics if required.
* Define retry policy for transient failures only.

Finalization remains explicitly separate from cleanup. The Build-ID-scoped
workspace, staging state, intermediate state, and partial candidate outputs are
not deleted by Level 13.8.

This revision does not introduce Build Evidence, artifact trust, release,
publication, cancellation, retry, or distributed tracing semantics.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

---

### Level 13.9 — Canonical Partial-Output Handling — 2026-08-24

This revision introduces canonical observation and propagation of package
outputs created or modified before unsuccessful package termination.

`PythonPackageBuilder` now computes changed direct outputs for all package
execution outcomes: `SUCCEEDED`, `FAILED`, and `ERROR`.

Failed and errored package results therefore retain filesystem consequences in
`PackageBuildResult.outputs`.

These outputs remain process-level partial outputs.

They are not promoted to canonical artifact candidates because Artifact
Discovery is not executed after unsuccessful package execution.

The application-level contract preserves partial outputs through
`CanonicalPackageBuildResult.execution.outputs` while leaving `discovery`
unset and `candidates` empty.

Unit validation confirms new or changed partial outputs are retained while
unchanged stale outputs are excluded.

Integration validation confirms a real failed Python package build can preserve
its generated source distribution in the failed `PackageBuildResult`.

This revision closes the Level 13 checklist item:

* Define partial-output handling.

Failure cleanup, cancellation semantics, and retry policy remain open.

No partial output is deleted by Level 13.9.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

---

### Level 13.10 — Canonical Failure Cleanup — 2026-08-24

This revision introduces canonical failure cleanup for Build-ID-scoped internal
package-build workspaces.

`BuildWorkspaceCleaner` removes the complete canonical workspace rooted at:

    <temporary-root>/familyos-build/<build-id>/

Cleanup is applied only after successful workspace initialization and only for
terminal non-successful canonical build results.

All current post-workspace terminal paths propagate the active
`BuildWorkspace` to the centralized `_finalize_result()` boundary.

The cleanup contract preserves:

* the original build status;
* the original failure diagnostic;
* execution observations;
* `PackageBuildResult.outputs`;
* the canonical package output directory.

Level 13.9 partial-output semantics therefore remain intact. Process-level
outputs created or modified before unsuccessful package termination are not
deleted by workspace cleanup.

Successful builds do not invoke failure cleanup.

Failures that occur before workspace initialization do not invoke cleanup
because no canonical workspace exists.

Application validation covers:

* failed package execution cleanup;
* errored package execution cleanup;
* successful workspace retention;
* partial-output preservation;
* effective-configuration failure cleanup;
* staging failure cleanup;
* artifact-validation failure cleanup;
* functional-validation failure cleanup.

Dedicated `BuildWorkspaceCleaner` validation confirms complete workspace
removal and idempotence when the workspace is already absent.

This revision closes the Level 13 checklist item:

* Define failure cleanup.

The following Level 13 concerns remain open:

* Define cancellation semantics if required.
* Define retry policy for transient failures only.

This revision does not introduce Build Evidence, artifact trust, release,
publication, cancellation, retry, or distributed tracing semantics.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

---

### Level 13.11 — Canonical Cancellation Semantics — 2026-08-24

This revision defines the cancellation semantics of the current canonical
package-build slice.

The current implementation is synchronous and exposes no runtime cancellation
boundary.

No cancellation token, asynchronous execution model, managed child-process
termination, explicit signal orchestration, or runtime `CANCELLED`
`PackageBuildStatus` is introduced.

`CANCELLED` remains a reserved lifecycle state.

The canonical runtime deliberately does not synthesize a cancellation result
when it cannot reliably observe and control cancellation.

Host-level interruption therefore remains outside the current canonical
package-build result model.

A future runtime cancellation implementation must introduce an explicit
execution boundary capable of observing cancellation, controlling the active
child process, preserving diagnostics and partial-output semantics, applying
deterministic workspace cleanup, and producing a deterministic non-successful
terminal result.

This revision closes the Level 13 checklist item:

* Define cancellation semantics if required.

The following Level 13 concern remains open:

* Define retry policy for transient failures only.

No production runtime code is changed by Level 13.11.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

---

### Level 13.12 — Canonical Retry Policy — 2026-08-24

This revision defines the retry policy of the current canonical package-build
runtime.

The current runtime performs exactly one packaging attempt and does not
automatically retry failed or errored execution.

Automatic retry is reserved for future failures that an explicit execution
boundary can reliably classify as transient.

The current implementation contains no canonical failure-classification model
that can safely make that distinction.

Accordingly:

* deterministic failures are non-retryable;
* unknown or unclassified failures are non-retryable by default;
* `PackageBuildStatus.ERROR` does not imply retryability;
* `PackageBuildStatus.FAILED` does not imply retryability.

Future retry support must introduce explicit transient-failure classification,
finite attempt limits, observable retry activity, preserved diagnostics,
partial-output semantics, consistent workspace cleanup, and deterministic
terminal-result behavior.

This revision closes the final open Level 13 checklist item:

* Define retry policy for transient failures only.

All Level 13 Build Execution checklist items are now closed.

No production runtime code is changed by Level 13.12.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

## Current Validation Evidence Status

The current post-release validation evidence has been fully recorded and validated in this revision history.

The authoritative execution evidence belongs in:

```text
VALIDATION.md
```

Current evidence is complete and supports the validated repository revalidation state recorded by this document.

---

## Final Revision Principle

EPIC-BLD-001 — Build Framework version `1.0.0` establishes the canonical FamilyOS build engineering foundation.

Its canonical documentation structure consists of:

```text
24 numbered documents
7 control documents
31 canonical files
```

Version `1.0.0` was historically published under:

```text
v4.7.0-build-framework
```

That historical publication tag is immutable.

Current post-release normalization and revalidation may improve the accuracy, consistency, and evidence quality of the Build Framework control-document layer without rewriting the historical publication state.

Future revisions SHALL preserve:

* explicit Build Architecture;
* artifact trust semantics;
* validation integrity;
* framework boundaries;
* release handoff separation;
* historical publication integrity.

---

### CI Permissions Security Contract Completion — 2026-08-25

This incremental revision completes Level 28 — CI Permissions without adding
privileged automation capability.

The canonical GitHub Actions workflow continues to operate with explicit
`contents: read` repository permission. It contains no repository-secret
references, no release/publication credential, no privileged package,
deployment, security-event, or OIDC-token permission, and no release,
publication, signing, promotion, or deployment operation.

The existing `pull_request` trigger remains non-privileged and
`pull_request_target` is absent. Ordinary pull-request validation and package
construction therefore receive no release credential authority.

External GitHub Actions remain pinned to immutable commit SHAs. A new structural
regression contract verifies these CI security assumptions and rejects future
introduction of privileged token scopes, repository-secret references,
`pull_request_target`, release/publication operations, or unpinned external
actions in the canonical Build workflow.

Build credentials and release credentials remain separated by explicit
authority boundary: the canonical Build workflow currently requires no release
credentials at all. Any future privileged Release automation remains owned and
governed separately by the Release Framework.

This revision closes the final five Level 28 checklist items and completes
CI Permissions at 9/9. It introduces no Release workflow, publication,
promotion, signing, provenance, deployment, or new secret capability.

---

### CI Caching Completion — 2026-08-25

This incremental revision completes Level 29 — CI Caching without changing
canonical Build semantics.

The ordinary canonical CI path now uses only the pip dependency cache exposed
by the pinned Python setup action. The explicit Python runtime remains part of
the setup state, while `requirements.txt` is the canonical dependency-state
input used for cache invalidation.

Cache restoration remains an optimization rather than an authority.
Dependencies are still installed from the locked requirements on every
canonical CI execution, and FamilyOS installation remains independent of a
cached environment. Package candidates, Build Evidence, validation evidence,
build-output directories, and local virtual environments remain outside
dependency-cache authority.

A separate `cache-free-validation` job performs dependency installation with
`--no-cache-dir`, restores no dependency cache, and executes canonical
validation plus the canonical CI-profile package build.

That cache-free path is exercised periodically through scheduled CI and is also
available through `workflow_dispatch` for explicit recovery from suspected or
corrupted cached state. No automatic cache-clearing retry is introduced.

The structural CI caching regression contract protects safe dependency caching,
runtime and dependency cache identity, correct cache-miss execution,
authoritative-state separation, periodic cache-free validation, and manual
cache-free recovery.

This revision closes all eight Level 29 checklist items and completes
CI Caching at 8/8.

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.

### Level 30 — Artifact Transfer Across CI Jobs

Implemented exact artifact identity preservation across canonical CI
automation stages.

The canonical build job now uploads both the package candidates and
their canonical Build Evidence. A distinct downstream
`artifact-validation` job downloads those authorities without
rebuilding the package.

The downstream stage recalculates SHA-256 digests from the transferred
candidate bytes and compares them with the integrity records contained
in canonical Build Evidence. Missing, unexpected, and changed
artifacts are rejected.

Behavioral contracts additionally execute the downstream verifier
against identical, mutated, missing, and unexpected artifact scenarios
to prove the transfer-integrity semantics independently of workflow
structure.

This completes Level 30 at 8/8 while preserving the security and
caching contracts established by Levels 28 and 29.

### Level 31 — Build-Once-Promote

Implemented the canonical Build-to-Release handoff boundary while
preserving separation of authority between Build and Release.

Canonical Build results now expose explicit Release handoff eligibility
only when execution succeeded, Build Validation passed, required
evidence exists, and the validation and artifact manifest belong to the
same Build ID.

An immutable `ReleaseHandoff` preserves the canonical Build ID,
artifact manifest and digests, Build Validation result, Build Evidence
reference, and artifact paths without recalculation or substitution.
The downstream handoff consumer preserves that established authority
unchanged.

Canonical CI now follows a build-once chain:

`validate -> artifact-validation -> release-handoff`

The artifact-validation stage verifies the transferred package bytes
against canonical Build Evidence before the release-handoff stage can
consume them. The release-handoff stage downloads those existing
validated artifacts and evidence without rebuilding or publishing them.

Build therefore prepares a trusted Release handoff but does not own
release approval, promotion, publication, or deployment.

This completes Level 31 — Build-Once-Promote at 9/9 and completes the
implementation sequence through Level 31.

### Final Build Framework Implementation Validation — 2026-08-26

Completed Level 50 — Final Build Framework Implementation Validation.

The mandatory final implementation contract is complete at 19/19. Historical
checklist and Definition-of-Done state was reconciled against implementation
evidence accumulated through the completed Build Framework Levels.

The final implementation state includes canonical Build execution, explicit
Build Context and profiles, reconstructable dependencies and environment,
artifact identity and integrity, direct artifact validation, Build Evidence,
reproducibility comparison, provenance representation, governed CI execution,
security boundaries, Build Governance, and exact validated-byte Release
Handoff.

Conditional and higher-maturity capabilities remain governed by their existing
adoption gates rather than being claimed without demonstrated need.

The final closure introduces no production-code, test, dependency, CI,
publication, signing, promotion, or deployment behavior.

**EPIC-BLD-001 Build Framework Implementation: Completed and Validated.**

Framework version `1.0.0` and immutable historical publication tag
`v4.7.0-build-framework` remain unchanged.
