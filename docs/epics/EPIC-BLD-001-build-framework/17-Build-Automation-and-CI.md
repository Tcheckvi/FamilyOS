# Build Framework

## 17 Build Automation and CI

### Overview

EPIC-BLD-001 — Build Framework defines how FamilyOS build capabilities are automated and integrated with Continuous Integration environments.

Build automation exists to execute known, governed, and validated build behavior consistently.

It does not replace build architecture.

It does not create build semantics independently.

It does not justify hidden logic.

The central principle is:

> Automation must execute the canonical FamilyOS build model, not become a parallel build system.

This document defines how build automation, CI execution, environment provisioning, validation, artifact collection, evidence generation, and release handoff should work together.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of Build Automation and CI is to establish a consistent automation model for FamilyOS.

The framework defines how automation should support:

* canonical build invocation;
* environment provisioning;
* dependency installation;
* toolchain validation;
* source validation;
* build execution;
* testing integration;
* artifact generation;
* artifact validation;
* evidence collection;
* quality gates;
* compliance checks;
* release-candidate preparation.

The objective is to reduce manual effort while preserving transparency, reproducibility, and governance.

---

## Automation Philosophy

FamilyOS follows the progression:

```text
Define
  ↓
Standardize
  ↓
Validate
  ↓
Automate
```

The opposite progression is rejected:

```text
Automate
  ↓
Discover Behavior Later
```

Automation should only formalize behavior that is already architecturally understood.

---

## Automation As Execution

Automation is an execution mechanism.

The canonical relationship is:

```text
Build Framework
      ↓
Canonical Build Semantics
      ↓
Automation Adapter
      ↓
CI Runtime
```

CI must remain an adapter around the Build Framework.

---

## CI Is Not The Build Architecture

FamilyOS explicitly rejects the model:

```text
CI Workflow
     ↓
Hidden Build Architecture
```

The target model is:

```text
Build Architecture
       ↓
Canonical Build Commands
       ↓
CI Workflow
```

A contributor should be able to understand how FamilyOS builds without reading the complete CI configuration.

---

## Automation Objectives

Build automation should improve:

* consistency;
* repeatability;
* independent validation;
* reproducibility;
* developer feedback;
* artifact traceability;
* quality enforcement;
* release readiness.

It must not reduce:

* transparency;
* local usability;
* debuggability;
* architectural clarity.

---

## Automation Principle 1 — Canonical Entry Points

Automation SHOULD invoke canonical build entry points.

The same conceptual operation should be usable from:

```text
Developer
   │
   ├── Local Build
   │
CI ├── Automated Build
   │
   └── Release Preparation
```

The execution context may differ.

The build semantics should remain aligned.

---

## Automation Principle 2 — CI Must Start From Controlled State

CI should execute from an identifiable repository revision.

A canonical CI flow begins with:

```text
Repository Revision
       ↓
Controlled Checkout
       ↓
Environment Preparation
       ↓
Canonical Validation
       ↓
Canonical Build
```

This creates independent verification of repository state.

---

## Automation Principle 3 — Environment Provisioning Must Be Explicit

CI should not depend on undocumented preinstalled state.

Required environment properties should be intentionally established.

Examples include:

* runtime version;
* dependency environment;
* build tools;
* validation tools;
* environment variables.

---

## Automation Principle 4 — Dependencies Must Be Installed From Canonical Definitions

CI dependency installation must derive from the same authoritative dependency model used by FamilyOS engineering.

The framework rejects:

```text
Local Dependency Definition
        ≠
CI Dependency Definition
```

The target is:

```text
Canonical Dependency Definition
            │
            ├── Local
            └── CI
```

---

## Automation Principle 5 — Validation Must Be Reusable

Validation rules should not be rewritten uniquely inside CI configuration.

The preferred model is:

```text
Canonical Validation
        ↓
Local Execution
        +
CI Execution
```

CI-specific presentation may differ.

Validation semantics should not.

---

## Automation Principle 6 — Build Outputs Must Be Explicit

CI should know exactly which outputs constitute candidate artifacts.

It should not rely on broad filesystem discovery.

The preferred model is:

```text
Canonical Build
      ↓
Known Artifact Set
      ↓
CI Artifact Collection
```

---

## Automation Principle 7 — Evidence Must Be Collected During Automation

CI provides a strong environment for collecting build evidence.

Evidence may include:

* source revision;
* Build ID;
* environment information;
* toolchain versions;
* validation results;
* artifact metadata;
* checksums;
* logs.

Evidence should emerge from canonical build behavior where practical.

---

## Automation Principle 8 — Failure Must Remain Visible

Automation must not hide failure.

Retries, conditional execution, and workflow logic must not make failed mandatory validation appear successful.

The rule is:

```text
Required Failure
       ↓
CI Failure
```

unless an explicitly governed exception applies.

---

## Automation Principle 9 — CI Provider Independence

FamilyOS build architecture should not depend conceptually on a specific CI provider.

Provider-specific workflows should adapt to the canonical Build Framework.

This improves portability and long-term maintainability.

---

## Automation Principle 10 — Automation Permissions Must Be Minimal

Build automation should receive only the permissions required for its role.

Ordinary validation and packaging jobs SHOULD NOT require:

* deployment credentials;
* production credentials;
* release publication authority.

This preserves separation of responsibilities.

---

## Automation Model

The canonical automation model is:

```text
Source Revision
      ↓
Checkout
      ↓
Environment Provisioning
      ↓
Dependency Installation
      ↓
Toolchain Validation
      ↓
Source Validation
      ↓
Testing
      ↓
Build Execution
      ↓
Artifact Validation
      ↓
Evidence Generation
      ↓
Artifact Collection
      ↓
Build Result
```

Release workflows may consume this result separately.

---

## CI Lifecycle

A FamilyOS CI build may follow these conceptual phases.

```text
CI Request
   ↓
Initialize
   ↓
Checkout
   ↓
Provision
   ↓
Validate Environment
   ↓
Install Dependencies
   ↓
Validate Source
   ↓
Execute Tests
   ↓
Execute Build
   ↓
Validate Artifacts
   ↓
Collect Evidence
   ↓
Publish CI Artifacts
   ↓
Finalize
```

The exact workflow structure may vary.

---

## CI Initialization

Initialization establishes the automation context.

This may identify:

* workflow run;
* repository;
* source revision;
* branch or tag;
* Build ID;
* selected profile.

This context supports traceability.

---

## Source Checkout

The CI system must obtain a known source state.

Checkout should preserve enough information to identify the revision that produced the build.

---

## Full Versus Shallow Repository History

Some build or release workflows may require access to:

* tags;
* version history;
* prior commits.

The Build Framework does not require complete history universally.

Checkout depth should match actual build needs.

---

## Working Tree State

CI builds should normally begin from a clean checkout.

This provides a useful reproducibility property:

```text
Known Commit
    ↓
Clean Working Tree
```

---

## Environment Provisioning

CI environment provisioning establishes:

* runtime;
* build tools;
* dependency environment;
* system requirements.

Provisioning should remain deterministic enough for the selected build profile.

---

## Runtime Provisioning

CI should use an explicitly selected supported runtime.

The runtime must not silently follow provider defaults.

---

## Toolchain Provisioning

Required tools should derive from project or framework definitions.

CI should avoid depending on undocumented tools bundled with a runner image.

---

## Dependency Installation

Dependencies should be installed from canonical declarations.

For stronger build profiles, locking may be enforced.

---

## Dependency Caching In CI

CI may cache dependency downloads or prepared environments.

Caching is allowed only as a performance optimization.

The semantic model remains:

```text
Cache Hit
   ↓
Valid Dependency State

Cache Miss
   ↓
Reconstruct Valid Dependency State
```

---

## Cache Validation

Cache keys should include the state that materially determines cached content.

Examples may include:

* runtime version;
* dependency lock state;
* platform;
* architecture.

Incomplete keys can cause invalid reuse.

---

## Source Validation Automation

CI may automate validation such as:

* Ruff;
* MyPy;
* structural validation;
* documentation validation.

These checks should invoke canonical configuration.

---

## Ruff Integration

Ruff may participate in automated source validation.

CI should use the same repository configuration used locally.

---

## MyPy Integration

MyPy may participate in static type validation.

CI must not maintain an independent type-checking configuration.

---

## Testing Integration

CI may invoke the Testing Framework to run:

* unit tests;
* integration tests;
* other applicable test levels.

The Testing Framework owns test semantics.

The Build Framework consumes the resulting evidence.

---

## Pytest Integration

For current Python FamilyOS components, Pytest may execute automated tests.

CI should invoke canonical test configuration and preserve relevant test results.

---

## Test Failure

Required test failure must block build trust for profiles where the test is mandatory.

---

## Parallel Validation

Independent validation stages may run in parallel where this reduces execution time.

For example:

```text
        ┌── Ruff
Source ─┼── MyPy
        └── Tests
```

The final build decision must aggregate all mandatory results.

---

## Build Execution Automation

After prerequisites succeed, CI may invoke canonical Build Execution.

Conceptually:

```text
Validated Source
      ↓
Canonical Build Entry Point
      ↓
Candidate Artifacts
```

CI should not reproduce package-generation commands independently unless those commands are themselves the canonical interface.

---

## Build Profile Selection In CI

CI must explicitly select its build profile.

Possible examples include:

```text
validation
ci
release-candidate
```

Profile selection should not depend on accidental provider context.

---

## CI Build Identity

Each automated build should be traceable through a Build ID or equivalent execution identity.

It may reference:

* CI run identifier;
* source revision;
* FamilyOS build identity.

The exact mapping can evolve.

---

## Artifact Validation Automation

CI provides an ideal environment for independent artifact validation.

Possible automated checks include:

* artifact presence;
* package structure;
* metadata;
* checksum generation;
* clean installation;
* import smoke test.

---

## Clean Installation Job

A stronger CI pipeline may create a fresh environment and install the produced artifact.

```text
Build Artifact
      ↓
Fresh Environment
      ↓
Install
      ↓
Smoke Validate
```

This detects packaging defects that source tests may miss.

---

## Artifact Integrity Automation

CI may calculate integrity digests after final candidate artifacts are produced.

These digests can become Build Evidence.

---

## Artifact Manifest Automation

A future CI build may create an artifact manifest describing all generated trusted outputs.

This improves downstream release handoff.

---

## Build Evidence Automation

CI can collect evidence such as:

```text
Build Evidence
│
├── Source Revision
├── Build ID
├── Runtime Version
├── Toolchain Versions
├── Dependency State
├── Validation Results
├── Artifact Manifest
└── Checksums
```

Evidence should remain tied to the actual artifacts produced.

---

## Log Collection

CI logs provide operational evidence.

Logs should support diagnosis without becoming the only representation of important build metadata.

Structured evidence is preferable for machine consumption.

---

## Test Reports

Automated test reports may be retained as Build Evidence when relevant.

Their format is governed by Testing and CI tooling.

---

## Validation Reports

Build Validation may generate a dedicated report.

CI should retain the report for profiles requiring traceable validation.

---

## Artifact Upload

CI may upload candidate or trusted artifacts to temporary automation storage.

This does not constitute official release publication.

---

## CI Artifact Storage Boundary

The distinction is:

```text
CI Artifact Storage
       ≠
Official Release Registry
```

CI storage is an engineering handoff or diagnostic mechanism.

---

## Build Once, Promote Later

FamilyOS should progressively adopt the principle:

```text
Build Once
    ↓
Validate
    ↓
Store Trusted Artifact
    ↓
Promote Same Bytes
```

This is preferable to rebuilding at each release stage.

---

## Automation And Release Handoff

A release workflow should consume explicit trusted Build outputs.

Conceptually:

```text
CI Build
   ↓
Trusted Artifact Set
   +
Evidence
   ↓
Release Workflow
```

The release workflow should not recreate the Build Framework independently.

---

## Release Trigger

The trigger for release may involve:

* tag;
* explicit workflow;
* approval;
* release branch;
* another governed event.

Trigger policy belongs primarily to the Release Framework.

---

## Automated Release Candidate Builds

A release-candidate automation may apply stricter controls.

Possible requirements include:

* tagged or identifiable source;
* clean checkout;
* canonical runtime;
* locked dependencies;
* complete validation;
* artifact integrity;
* strong evidence.

---

## Release Credentials

Release publication credentials should only be exposed to release-specific stages.

They should not be available to ordinary build and test jobs.

---

## Environment Separation

A strong automation architecture may separate:

```text
Validation Job
Build Job
Release Job
Deployment Job
```

where different permissions apply.

This supports least privilege.

---

## CI Job Architecture

CI workflows may use several jobs.

A conceptual model is:

```text
Source Validation
       ↓
Testing
       ↓
Build
       ↓
Artifact Validation
       ↓
Release Readiness
```

Some stages may run in parallel.

---

## Monolithic Versus Multi-Job CI

A single CI job may be sufficient during early maturity.

Multiple jobs should be introduced only when they provide:

* isolation;
* parallelism;
* clearer evidence;
* stronger permission boundaries.

Infrastructure complexity must remain proportional.

---

## CI Matrix Builds

Matrix execution may validate multiple supported environments.

For example:

```text
Python Version A
Python Version B
Python Version C
```

A matrix should reflect actual compatibility requirements.

---

## Canonical Artifact Build

FamilyOS may test multiple environments while producing official candidate artifacts using one canonical build environment.

This distinction should remain explicit.

---

## Platform Matrix

Future builds may validate across:

* operating systems;
* architectures;
* runtime versions.

Matrix complexity should grow only with actual platform support.

---

## Automated Plugin Builds

Official plugins may use automation for:

* plugin source validation;
* metadata validation;
* compliance checks;
* packaging;
* artifact validation.

---

## Plugin Automation Model

```text
Plugin Source
      ↓
Plugin Validation
      ↓
Compliance
      ↓
Canonical Plugin Build
      ↓
Plugin Artifact Validation
      ↓
Trusted Plugin Artifact
```

---

## Plugin Compliance Automation

The Plugin Compliance Framework may expose automated checks.

Build automation should invoke these checks where required.

It must not redefine compliance policy.

---

## Documentation Automation

CI may automate:

* Markdown validation;
* documentation generation;
* index checks;
* artifact creation.

Documentation output may become part of the build artifact set.

---

## Documentation Drift Detection

Automation can detect when generated documentation or indexes are stale relative to authoritative sources.

This may prevent repository drift.

---

## Build Configuration Automation

CI should consume canonical Build Configuration.

CI-specific variables may provide context but should not become independent configuration architecture.

---

## Environment Variable Governance In CI

CI environments often contain many variables.

Canonical build behavior should only consume explicitly defined values.

---

## Secret Management In CI

Secrets must be managed through the CI provider's secure mechanism or an equivalent governed system.

Secrets MUST NOT be:

* committed;
* printed;
* embedded in artifacts;
* copied into ordinary evidence.

---

## Secret Scope

Secrets should be scoped to the minimum job or stage requiring them.

For example:

```text
Build Job
  → no release token

Release Job
  → publication token
```

---

## CI Permissions

Repository and workflow permissions should be minimized.

Read-only permissions are preferable for ordinary validation where sufficient.

---

## Untrusted Contributions

Automation triggered by untrusted contributions requires careful secret and permission handling.

Build validation must not expose privileged secrets to untrusted code.

---

## Pull Request Builds

Pull request automation may perform:

* validation;
* tests;
* non-privileged builds.

It should normally avoid privileged release operations.

---

## Branch Builds

Branch workflows may provide continuous validation of engineering state.

---

## Main Branch Builds

The primary branch may perform stronger integration validation than feature branches where appropriate.

The exact branch policy belongs to engineering workflow governance.

---

## Tag Builds

Tag-triggered builds may participate in release candidate generation.

Tags must not automatically imply release approval unless Release Framework governance explicitly defines that behavior.

---

## Scheduled Automation

Some build validation may run periodically.

Examples include:

* dependency compatibility;
* reproducibility checks;
* extended validation.

Scheduled automation should only exist when it provides clear value.

---

## Reproducibility Automation

Future CI may periodically execute equivalent builds and compare outputs.

```text
Build A
   ↓
Artifact A

Build B
   ↓
Artifact B

Compare
```

Differences should be analyzed.

---

## Clean Build Automation

CI should regularly prove that FamilyOS can build from clean state.

Fresh runners naturally support this objective.

---

## Cache-Free Validation

Occasional cache-free builds may help detect hidden dependence on cached state.

This need not occur on every build.

---

## Dependency Update Automation

Automated dependency-update tools may propose changes.

They must not bypass:

* review;
* tests;
* build validation;
* security checks.

Automation may propose.

Governance decides.

---

## Toolchain Update Automation

Similarly, tool updates may be proposed automatically.

Adoption must remain controlled.

---

## Failure Handling In CI

CI failure should be explicit and actionable.

A failed build should provide:

* failing job;
* failing stage;
* relevant diagnostics;
* artifact state where useful.

---

## Fail-Fast

Some workflows may stop on the first mandatory failure.

This reduces resource usage.

---

## Continue-On-Failure

Independent validation may continue to provide a fuller defect picture.

This must not turn mandatory failures into successful pipeline status.

---

## CI Retries

Automatic job retries should be restricted to transient infrastructure problems.

Retries must not become a response to deterministic test or build failures.

---

## Flaky Automation

Repeatedly flaky CI reduces engineering confidence.

Flakiness should be treated as quality debt.

---

## CI Determinism

Equivalent source and context should produce stable CI behavior.

Unexplained run-to-run variation should trigger investigation.

---

## Automation Observability

CI should provide visibility into:

* workflow;
* jobs;
* stages;
* durations;
* artifacts;
* validation;
* failure.

The Build Framework should not depend on provider-specific UI as its only source of evidence.

---

## Automation Metrics

Potential automation metrics include:

* CI success rate;
* build duration;
* queue time;
* cache hit rate;
* failure category;
* artifact validation failure rate;
* retry rate.

Metrics should support decisions.

---

## Build Duration Regression

Automation can provide a baseline for detecting build performance regressions.

Performance thresholds should only become blocking when explicitly governed.

---

## CI Queue Time

Queue time is an infrastructure metric rather than Build Framework semantics.

It may still influence developer experience.

---

## Automation Evidence Retention

CI may retain build evidence for a defined period.

Stronger retention may be required for release candidates.

---

## Evidence Identity

Evidence should identify:

* source revision;
* build identity;
* artifact set.

This prevents confusion between outputs from different runs.

---

## Artifact Retention

Routine feature-branch artifacts may require short retention.

Release candidate artifacts may require longer retention.

Exact retention duration is an operational or release policy.

---

## Artifact Promotion Between Jobs

If one CI job builds an artifact and another validates it, the same bytes must be transferred.

The second job must not silently rebuild.

---

## Multi-Stage Artifact Integrity

When artifacts move between automation stages:

```text
Build Job
   ↓
Artifact + Digest
   ↓
Validation Job
   ↓
Verify Digest
```

This strengthens continuity.

---

## Automation Portability

Build automation should make migration between CI providers reasonably possible.

Portability improves when:

* build commands live outside provider YAML;
* configuration is repository-controlled;
* environment requirements are explicit;
* artifacts use standard formats.

---

## Provider-Specific Adapters

Provider-specific concepts may include:

* checkout actions;
* cache actions;
* artifact upload actions;
* job permissions.

These belong to integration adapters.

---

## Automation As Code

CI configuration should be version controlled.

Automation changes should therefore receive review like other engineering changes.

---

## CI Configuration Review

Review should consider:

* semantic build changes;
* permissions;
* secret exposure;
* environment changes;
* dependency behavior;
* artifact handling.

---

## Automation Governance

Significant CI changes may require architectural review if they alter canonical build behavior.

Changing provider-specific syntax does not necessarily require architectural governance.

---

## CI Workflow Ownership

Automation workflows should have identifiable ownership.

Unowned CI configuration tends to accumulate fragile logic.

---

## CI Technical Debt

Automation debt includes:

* duplicated steps;
* obsolete actions;
* hidden build logic;
* overly broad permissions;
* stale runtime versions;
* permanent retry workarounds;
* abandoned jobs.

This debt should be managed.

---

## Automation Security

CI automation is a high-value software supply-chain target.

Security must therefore consider:

* dependency actions;
* third-party automation components;
* workflow permissions;
* secret access;
* artifact integrity;
* untrusted code execution.

---

## Third-Party CI Components

External workflow components should be selected and governed carefully.

Critical automation must not blindly execute untrusted remote code.

---

## Pinned Automation Dependencies

Where supported and justified, CI dependencies may be pinned to stable versions or immutable identifiers.

The exact strategy should align with Security Architecture.

---

## Build Isolation In CI

CI builds should use sufficient isolation to prevent cross-run contamination.

Ephemeral runners provide a strong default.

---

## Self-Hosted Runners

If FamilyOS later uses self-hosted runners, additional controls may be required for:

* workspace cleanup;
* secret isolation;
* toolchain drift;
* cross-build contamination.

---

## Remote Build Services

Future FamilyOS maturity may introduce remote build execution.

Such systems must integrate with canonical Build Context and Evidence models.

They should not create a separate architecture.

---

## Automation Quality Gates

CI may enforce build-related quality gates.

For example:

```text
Source Validation
       ↓
Testing
       ↓
Build Validation
       ↓
Quality Gate
```

The Quality Framework owns gate semantics.

---

## Gate Failure

A blocking quality gate must fail the appropriate automation path.

---

## Compliance Gates

Plugin builds may require compliance gates before artifact trust.

---

## Security Gates

Release candidate builds may eventually require security gates.

These should consume governed security evidence.

---

## Build Automation Profiles

Automation profiles may correspond to build purposes.

---

## Pull Request Profile

Possible focus:

* source validation;
* tests;
* build smoke check.

---

## Main Integration Profile

Possible focus:

* full tests;
* canonical build;
* artifact validation;
* standard evidence.

---

## Release Candidate Profile

Possible focus:

* strict source state;
* locked dependencies;
* canonical environment;
* full validation;
* artifact integrity;
* strong evidence.

---

## Automation And Local Developer Experience

CI should reinforce local workflows.

A developer should ideally be able to reproduce a failing CI validation locally.

The target is:

```text
CI Failure
   ↓
Known Canonical Command
   ↓
Local Reproduction
```

---

## CI-Only Failure

If a failure cannot be reproduced locally because CI uses hidden semantics, automation architecture should be reviewed.

---

## Automation Documentation

Important automation behavior should be documented.

Documentation should explain:

* what CI validates;
* which canonical commands are invoked;
* which artifacts are retained;
* what profiles exist;
* how failures can be reproduced locally.

---

## Automation Change Lifecycle

Automation changes should follow:

```text
Requirement
   ↓
Workflow Change
   ↓
Review
   ↓
Validation
   ↓
Observe
   ↓
Document
```

---

## Automation Anti-Pattern — Build Logic Only In CI YAML

Critical build behavior must live in canonical build implementation or configuration.

---

## Automation Anti-Pattern — Hidden Dependency Installation

CI must not install packages that canonical dependency definitions do not require.

---

## Automation Anti-Pattern — Provider Default Runtime

Canonical builds must not silently depend on whichever runtime version a CI provider currently ships.

---

## Automation Anti-Pattern — Rebuild During Release

A release pipeline should prefer promoting the validated CI artifact rather than rebuilding different bytes.

---

## Automation Anti-Pattern — Excessive Secrets

Ordinary build jobs must not receive release or production credentials.

---

## Automation Anti-Pattern — Always Retry

Deterministic failures should fail.

---

## Automation Anti-Pattern — Permanent Continue-On-Error

Mandatory validation that permanently uses continue-on-error is not truly mandatory.

---

## Automation Anti-Pattern — Cache As Required State

Removing the cache must not make a valid build impossible.

---

## Automation Anti-Pattern — CI And Local Drift

CI must not gradually become a separate engineering environment with incompatible commands and configuration.

---

## Automation Anti-Pattern — Workflow Duplication

Multiple workflows should not independently duplicate the same build procedure.

Shared canonical commands should be reused.

---

## Automation Maturity Model

FamilyOS Build Automation may evolve through:

```text
Level 1
Manual Builds

    ↓

Level 2
Scripted Canonical Builds

    ↓

Level 3
Automated Validation

    ↓

Level 4
CI Build Integration

    ↓

Level 5
Artifact Validation And Evidence

    ↓

Level 6
Build-Once-Promote Workflows

    ↓

Level 7
Reproducibility Automation

    ↓

Level 8
Policy-Driven Supply Chain Automation
```

Each stage should deliver clear engineering value.

---

## Automation Success Criteria

Build Automation and CI are successful when FamilyOS can answer:

1. which canonical command CI invokes;
2. which source revision was built;
3. which runtime was provisioned;
4. how dependencies were installed;
5. which validations executed;
6. which tests executed;
7. which build profile was used;
8. which candidate artifacts were generated;
9. whether the actual artifacts were validated;
10. which evidence was retained;
11. why a CI build failed;
12. whether the same failure can be reproduced locally;
13. whether CI relies on hidden provider state;
14. whether secrets were appropriately isolated;
15. whether the artifact handed downstream is the same validated artifact;
16. whether automation remains subordinate to Build Framework governance.

---

## Automation Invariants

The following invariants should remain true.

### Invariant 1

CI must invoke canonical FamilyOS build semantics.

### Invariant 2

CI must operate from identifiable source state.

### Invariant 3

Required runtime and tooling must be explicitly provisioned or validated.

### Invariant 4

Dependencies must derive from canonical project definitions.

### Invariant 5

Mandatory validation failure must fail the appropriate automation path.

### Invariant 6

Candidate artifacts must be explicitly collected.

### Invariant 7

Release publication authority must remain separated from ordinary build jobs.

### Invariant 8

CI caches must remain optional optimizations.

### Invariant 9

The artifact promoted downstream must match the artifact validated upstream.

### Invariant 10

CI provider-specific implementation must not redefine Build Framework architecture.

---

## Canonical CI Flow

The FamilyOS CI Build Framework flow can be summarized as:

```text
Checkout Known Revision
        ↓
Provision Runtime
        ↓
Install Canonical Dependencies
        ↓
Validate Toolchain
        ↓
Validate Source
        ↓
Run Applicable Tests
        ↓
Execute Canonical Build
        ↓
Collect Candidate Artifacts
        ↓
Validate Artifacts
        ↓
Generate Integrity Data
        ↓
Collect Build Evidence
        ↓
Store Trusted Artifact Set
        ↓
Expose Release Handoff
```

This flow turns CI into an independent execution and assurance environment for the canonical FamilyOS Build Framework.

---

## Final Principle

The FamilyOS Build Automation and CI model is founded on the following rule:

> Automation must make the Build Framework more repeatable, not less understandable.

CI should not be a hidden machine that somehow produces green checks.

It should be a transparent, reproducible execution environment for canonical FamilyOS engineering behavior.

A mature automation system allows developers to understand what is happening, reproduce failures, trust generated artifacts, and hand the exact validated outputs to downstream release processes.

That is the role of automation within EPIC-BLD-001.
