### README

### Overview

This directory contains the official documentation for:

**EPIC-BLD-001 — Build Framework**

The Build Framework defines how FamilyOS transforms controlled engineering state into validated, traceable, and trustworthy software artifacts.

It establishes build engineering as an explicit FamilyOS platform capability covering:

* build inputs;
* Build Context;
* toolchains;
* environments;
* dependencies;
* configuration;
* build execution;
* artifact management;
* artifact validation;
* build evidence;
* automation;
* Continuous Integration;
* governance;
* reproducibility;
* release handoff.

The framework provides the architectural bridge between FamilyOS engineering state and the Release Framework.

## Canonical Directory

```text
docs/epics/EPIC-BLD-001-build-framework/
```

This directory is the authoritative location for the EPIC-BLD-001 documentation baseline.

---

## Framework Mission

The mission of EPIC-BLD-001 is:

> Establish a controlled engineering system that transforms identifiable FamilyOS source state into validated and traceable software artifacts through explicit, reproducible, automatable, and governed build processes.

---

## Core Build Model

The canonical FamilyOS Build Model is:

```text
Build Inputs
     ↓
Build Context Resolution
     ↓
Environment Preparation
     ↓
Dependency Resolution
     ↓
Toolchain Validation
     ↓
Pre-Build Validation
     ↓
Build Execution
     ↓
Candidate Artifacts
     ↓
Artifact Validation
     ↓
Build Evidence
     ↓
Trusted Artifact Set
     ↓
Release Handoff
```

---

## Build Trust Model

EPIC-BLD-001 establishes the following progression:

```text
Raw Output
    ↓
Candidate Artifact
    ↓
Validated Artifact
    ↓
Trusted Artifact
```

The framework therefore preserves two essential distinctions:

```text
Build Success
      ≠
Artifact Trust
```

and:

```text
Artifact Trust
      ≠
Release Authorization
```

---

## Canonical Structure

The Build Framework contains exactly twenty-four numbered chapters.

```text
00-EPIC.md
01-Context.md
02-Vision.md
03-Build-Principles.md
04-Build-Architecture.md
05-Build-Lifecycle.md
06-Build-Input-Requirements.md
07-Build-Inputs-and-Project-Structure.md
08-Build-Toolchain.md
09-Build-Environment-Management.md
10-Dependency-Management.md
11-Build-Configuration.md
12-Build-Philosophy.md
13-Build-Execution.md
14-Artifact-Management.md
15-Build-Validation.md
16-Build-Governance.md
17-Build-Automation-and-CI.md
18-Roadmap.md
19-References.md
20-Validation.md
21-Summary.md
22-Release.md
23-Implementation-Checklist.md
```

The framework also contains seven control documents.

```text
EPIC-BLD-001.md
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

The complete canonical baseline therefore contains:

```text
24 numbered documents
+
7 control documents
=
31 canonical files
```

## Relationship With The Engineering Platform

EPIC-BLD-001 is part of the FamilyOS Engineering Platform framework sequence.

```text
EPIC-ENG-001
Engineering Foundation
        ↓
EPIC-TST-001
Testing Framework
        ↓
EPIC-QLT-001
Quality Framework
        ↓
EPIC-DOC-001
Documentation Framework
        ↓
EPIC-PLUGIN-002
Plugin Compliance Framework
        ↓
EPIC-BLD-001
Build Framework
        ↓
EPIC-REL-001
Release Framework
```

Each framework retains its own domain ownership.

---

## Relationship With EPIC-ENG-001

The Engineering Foundation defines general engineering principles, governance, repository conventions, and lifecycle expectations.

EPIC-BLD-001 specializes these concepts for build engineering.

---

## Relationship With EPIC-TST-001

The Build Framework may invoke tests and consume test evidence.

Testing semantics remain governed by the Testing Framework.

---

## Relationship With EPIC-QLT-001

Build Evidence may contribute to quality assessment and quality gates.

Quality policy remains governed by the Quality Framework.

---

## Relationship With EPIC-DOC-001

The Build Framework documentation follows FamilyOS documentation governance.

EPIC-BLD-001 does not redefine documentation standards.

---

## Relationship With EPIC-PLUGIN-002

Official plugin builds may consume plugin compliance results.

Plugin compliance rules remain governed by EPIC-PLUGIN-002.

---

## Relationship With EPIC-REL-001

The Build Framework produces:

```text
Trusted Artifact Set
        +
Build Evidence
```

The Release Framework owns:

```text
Versioning
Release Evaluation
Approval
Promotion
Publication
Distribution
```

The boundary is therefore:

```text
EPIC-BLD-001
      ↓
Trusted Artifact + Evidence
      ↓
EPIC-REL-001
```

---

## Build Context

The Build Context represents the effective state used by a build.

```text
Build Context =
    Source State
  + Effective Configuration
  + Dependency State
  + Toolchain State
  + Environment State
  + Build Profile
  + Applicable Policies
```

This concept is central to:

* traceability;
* reproducibility;
* diagnostics;
* validation;
* evidence.

---

## Build Profiles

The initial conceptual Build Profiles are:

```text
development
validation
ci
release-candidate
```

Profiles may increase requirements for:

* validation;
* evidence;
* dependency control;
* environment control;
* source-state control.

---

## Artifact Model

The canonical artifact lifecycle is:

```text
Build Execution
      ↓
Raw Output
      ↓
Candidate Artifact
      ↓
Artifact Validation
      ↓
Validated Artifact
      ↓
Build Evidence
      ↓
Trusted Artifact
```

Trusted artifact state must remain explicit.

---

## Build Evidence

Build Evidence may include:

```text
Build ID
Source Revision
Target
Build Profile
Effective Configuration
Dependency State
Runtime Version
Toolchain Versions
Validation Results
Artifact Manifest
Artifact Digests
```

Evidence requirements depend on build purpose.

---

## Automation Model

CI and other automation must execute canonical build behavior.

```text
Build Framework
      ↓
Canonical Build Interface
      ↓
Automation Adapter
      ↓
CI Environment
```

Provider-specific CI configuration must not become the only source of Build Architecture.

---

## Build Once, Promote

The preferred long-term integration with the Release Framework is:

```text
Source
  ↓
Build Once
  ↓
Validate
  ↓
Trusted Artifact
  ↓
Release Evaluation
  ↓
Promote Same Bytes
```

This reduces downstream rebuild drift.

---

## Framework Status

The Build Framework documentation architecture is structurally complete when:

```text
Numbered Documents: 24
Control Documents: 7
Canonical Files: 31
Duplicate Numbers: 0
Empty Files: 0
Legacy Files: 0
```

Final framework closure additionally requires semantic validation and control-document synchronization.

---

## Framework Validation

Framework validation is defined in:

```text
20-Validation.md
```

Final validation must verify:

* canonical structure;
* document completeness;
* architectural consistency;
* terminology;
* Build/Release boundary;
* cross-framework integration;
* governance;
* control documents;
* implementation readiness.

---

## Implementation

The framework is intentionally architecture-first.

Framework completion does not imply that every roadmap capability has already been implemented.

```text
Framework Complete
       ≠
Implementation Complete
```

Implementation progression is defined by:

```text
23-Implementation-Checklist.md
```

---

## Recommended Implementation Direction

The recommended progression is:

```text
Canonical Build Interface
        ↓
Environment Standardization
        ↓
Dependency Standardization
        ↓
Configuration Standardization
        ↓
Canonical Build Execution
        ↓
Artifact Management
        ↓
Artifact Validation
        ↓
CI Integration
        ↓
Build Identity
        ↓
Build Evidence
        ↓
Release Handoff
        ↓
Reproducibility
        ↓
Supply Chain Assurance
```

---

## Current Maturity Position

The EPIC establishes the architectural baseline first.

Implementation should then evolve incrementally through:

```text
Foundation
   ↓
Standardization
   ↓
Validation
   ↓
Automation
   ↓
Artifact Trust
   ↓
Reproducibility
   ↓
Release Integration
   ↓
Supply Chain Assurance
```

Advanced infrastructure should only be introduced when real engineering needs justify it.

---

## Structural Validation

The canonical structure can be verified using the repository tree.

Expected state:

```text
24 numbered documents
7 control documents
31 canonical files
```

There must be:

```text
0 duplicate numbers
0 empty files
0 legacy files
```

---

## Normative Authority

The normative numbered chapters define Build Framework architecture and behavior.

The control documents govern:

* framework identity;
* inventory;
* status;
* history;
* validation;
* navigation.

Control documents must remain aligned with the normative architecture.

---

## Final Principle

EPIC-BLD-001 is founded on the following rule:

> FamilyOS does not trust software because a build command succeeded. FamilyOS trusts an artifact when the process that produced it is controlled, the artifact itself has been validated, and sufficient evidence exists to understand its origin.

The Build Framework therefore establishes the official FamilyOS engineering contract between controlled source state and trusted software artifact state.
