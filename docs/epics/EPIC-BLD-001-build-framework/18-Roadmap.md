# Build Framework

## 18 Roadmap

### Overview

EPIC-BLD-001 — Build Framework defines the roadmap through which FamilyOS build engineering can evolve from its current foundation toward a mature, reproducible, traceable, automated, and supply-chain-aware build capability.

The Build Roadmap is intentionally incremental.

Its purpose is not to introduce the most advanced possible build infrastructure immediately.

Its purpose is to define a controlled progression in which each stage solves demonstrated engineering needs while preserving:

* simplicity;
* correctness;
* maintainability;
* reproducibility;
* traceability;
* security;
* governance.

The central principle is:

> Build maturity must grow in response to engineering needs, not infrastructure ambition.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of the Build Roadmap is to provide a structured evolution path for EPIC-BLD-001.

The roadmap defines:

* maturity stages;
* implementation priorities;
* foundational capabilities;
* automation progression;
* artifact-management evolution;
* reproducibility objectives;
* evidence maturity;
* security progression;
* release integration;
* future supply-chain capabilities.

The roadmap guides implementation without requiring all future-state capabilities at once.

---

## Roadmap Philosophy

FamilyOS follows the progression:

```text
Understand
  ↓
Standardize
  ↓
Validate
  ↓
Automate
  ↓
Reproduce
  ↓
Trace
  ↓
Assure
```

Each stage depends on the stability of the previous one.

Automation before standardization increases inconsistency.

Reproducibility without explicit inputs is unreliable.

Supply-chain assurance without stable artifact identity creates unnecessary complexity.

---

## Roadmap Objectives

The Build Framework roadmap aims to progressively establish:

1. canonical build semantics;
2. explicit build inputs;
3. controlled environments;
4. governed dependencies;
5. stable build configuration;
6. canonical execution;
7. explicit artifact management;
8. automated validation;
9. CI integration;
10. build evidence;
11. reproducibility;
12. traceability;
13. release handoff;
14. stronger supply-chain assurance.

---

## Roadmap Model

The roadmap is organized into eight maturity phases.

```text
Phase 1 — Build Foundation
        ↓
Phase 2 — Build Standardization
        ↓
Phase 3 — Build Validation
        ↓
Phase 4 — Build Automation
        ↓
Phase 5 — Artifact Trust
        ↓
Phase 6 — Reproducibility and Traceability
        ↓
Phase 7 — Release Integration
        ↓
Phase 8 — Supply Chain Assurance
```

These phases describe engineering maturity rather than fixed calendar releases.

---

## Phase 1 — Build Foundation

### Objective

Establish the normative Build Framework and define the canonical concepts required for future implementation.

This phase focuses on architecture and documentation before additional build infrastructure is introduced.

---

### Capabilities

Phase 1 establishes:

* Build Framework scope;
* Build Principles;
* Build Architecture;
* Build Lifecycle;
* Build Input Requirements;
* Build Toolchain model;
* Build Environment model;
* Dependency Management model;
* Build Configuration model;
* Build Execution model;
* Artifact Management model;
* Build Validation model;
* Build Governance model;
* Build Automation model.

---

### Primary Deliverables

The principal deliverable is the complete EPIC-BLD-001 documentation set.

Supporting control documents include:

```text
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

---

### Success Criteria

Phase 1 is complete when FamilyOS has an internally consistent and validated normative Build Framework.

---

## Phase 2 — Build Standardization

### Objective

Translate the Build Framework architecture into consistent everyday engineering workflows.

The objective is to eliminate unnecessary variation between developers and build contexts.

---

### Capabilities

Phase 2 may establish:

* canonical local build command;
* canonical package build procedure;
* explicit output locations;
* documented prerequisites;
* standardized dependency setup;
* standardized environment setup;
* standardized build profiles;
* standard cleanup procedure.

---

### Canonical Build Interface

FamilyOS should progressively expose one primary build interface.

Illustratively:

```text
familyos build
```

or an equivalent project-standard mechanism.

The exact interface must be defined during implementation.

---

### Standard Local Build

The local build workflow should become:

```text
Prepare Environment
      ↓
Install Declared Dependencies
      ↓
Run Canonical Build
      ↓
Inspect Artifact
```

This reduces dependence on developer-specific procedures.

---

### Build Output Standardization

Output locations should become predictable.

For example:

```text
dist/
```

or another governed canonical output location.

---

### Success Criteria

Phase 2 is complete when developers can execute the same documented build workflow from supported environments and obtain equivalent candidate outputs.

---

## Phase 3 — Build Validation

### Objective

Introduce systematic validation around build inputs, execution, and artifacts.

The objective is to move from:

```text
Build Completed
```

to:

```text
Build Validated
```

---

### Capabilities

Phase 3 may introduce:

* source readiness checks;
* configuration validation;
* dependency validation;
* runtime validation;
* toolchain validation;
* artifact presence checks;
* artifact metadata checks;
* package installation checks;
* artifact smoke tests.

---

## Pre-Build Validation

Builds should increasingly validate:

* required files;
* supported runtime;
* required tools;
* dependency state;
* configuration.

---

## Post-Build Validation

Candidate artifacts should increasingly be checked for:

* presence;
* expected naming;
* package structure;
* metadata;
* installability.

---

## Clean Installation Validation

A high-value milestone is:

```text
Build Artifact
      ↓
Fresh Environment
      ↓
Install Artifact
      ↓
Smoke Test
```

This provides assurance beyond source-level testing.

---

### Success Criteria

Phase 3 is complete when a successful canonical build is followed by repeatable automated validation of the actual produced artifacts.

---

## Phase 4 — Build Automation

### Objective

Execute canonical build and validation processes automatically through CI.

The objective is not simply to add CI jobs.

It is to make CI a controlled execution environment for the Build Framework.

---

### Capabilities

Phase 4 may establish:

* automated environment provisioning;
* canonical dependency installation;
* Ruff execution;
* MyPy execution;
* Pytest execution;
* canonical package build;
* artifact collection;
* artifact validation;
* CI evidence retention.

---

## CI Pipeline Foundation

A target pipeline may resemble:

```text
Checkout
   ↓
Environment Setup
   ↓
Dependencies
   ↓
Ruff
   ↓
MyPy
   ↓
Pytest
   ↓
Build
   ↓
Artifact Validation
```

Independent validation stages may later run in parallel.

---

## Local And CI Alignment

A major milestone is:

```text
Local Command
      =
CI Command
```

at the semantic level.

---

## CI Artifact Collection

CI should explicitly collect generated artifact sets rather than discover them indirectly.

---

### Success Criteria

Phase 4 is complete when a fresh CI environment can execute the canonical FamilyOS build and artifact-validation workflow without relying on undocumented runner state.

---

## Phase 5 — Artifact Trust

### Objective

Strengthen the distinction between generated output and trusted artifact.

This phase formalizes artifact identity, integrity, metadata, and evidence.

---

### Capabilities

Phase 5 may introduce:

* Build IDs;
* artifact manifests;
* checksums;
* artifact metadata;
* validation reports;
* evidence bundles;
* explicit artifact trust states.

---

## Build Identity

Each significant automated build should become uniquely identifiable.

Conceptually:

```text
Build ID
  │
  ├── Source Revision
  ├── Configuration
  ├── Artifacts
  └── Evidence
```

---

## Artifact Manifest

A manifest may explicitly enumerate:

* artifacts;
* types;
* sizes;
* paths;
* digests;
* validation status.

---

## Artifact Integrity

Cryptographic digests should increasingly protect artifact identity.

The sequence becomes:

```text
Artifact
   ↓
Digest
   ↓
Validation
   ↓
Trusted Artifact
```

---

## Evidence Bundle

A standard evidence bundle may contain:

```text
Build ID
Source Revision
Toolchain
Dependency State
Validation Results
Artifact Manifest
Checksums
```

---

### Success Criteria

Phase 5 is complete when FamilyOS can identify and verify the origin and integrity of significant build artifacts.

---

## Phase 6 — Reproducibility And Traceability

### Objective

Strengthen the ability to reconstruct and compare FamilyOS builds.

This phase moves the platform from repeatable procedure toward stronger reproducibility guarantees.

---

### Capabilities

Phase 6 may establish:

* stronger dependency locking;
* explicit canonical toolchain versions;
* reproducible environment definitions;
* build-context fingerprints;
* artifact comparison;
* reproducibility testing.

---

## Reproducible Dependency State

Dependency resolution should become increasingly deterministic.

The target is:

```text
Declaration
   +
Lock State
   ↓
Known Dependency Graph
```

---

## Reproducible Toolchain

Critical build tools should increasingly have controlled version identity.

---

## Reproducible Environment

Environment setup may evolve from:

```text
Documented
```

toward:

```text
Declaratively Reconstructable
```

Possible future mechanisms include:

* scripted provisioning;
* containers;
* immutable images.

The technology should be selected only when necessary.

---

## Build Context Fingerprint

A future build context fingerprint may represent:

```text
Source
Configuration
Dependencies
Toolchain
Environment
```

This may support artifact comparison and safe caching.

---

## Reproducibility Testing

CI may periodically execute equivalent builds and compare outputs.

```text
Build A
   ↓
Artifact A

Build B
   ↓
Artifact B

Compare
```

Differences should be categorized and explainable.

---

### Success Criteria

Phase 6 is complete when FamilyOS can reconstruct important build contexts with low uncontrolled variability and explain meaningful artifact differences.

---

## Phase 7 — Release Integration

### Objective

Establish a strong artifact handoff contract between EPIC-BLD-001 and EPIC-REL-001.

The key objective is to ensure that official releases promote validated artifacts rather than rebuilding them under different conditions.

---

### Capabilities

Phase 7 may establish:

* explicit release candidate profile;
* release artifact manifest;
* build evidence handoff;
* integrity verification across stages;
* artifact promotion;
* immutable release candidate handling.

---

## Build Once, Promote

The target release model is:

```text
Source
  ↓
Build Once
  ↓
Validate
  ↓
Trusted Artifact
  ↓
Promote
  ↓
Release
```

---

## Release Candidate Handoff

The Build Framework may provide:

```text
Release Candidate Handoff
│
├── Build ID
├── Artifact Set
├── Artifact Manifest
├── Digests
├── Validation Result
└── Evidence
```

---

## Integrity Across Handoff

The Release Framework should verify that candidate artifact bytes match Build Framework integrity information.

---

## Rebuild Avoidance

The release workflow should avoid:

```text
Build
  ↓
Validate
  ↓
Rebuild
  ↓
Publish
```

unless reproducible rebuild is itself an intentionally governed release model.

---

### Success Criteria

Phase 7 is complete when the Release Framework can consume and promote the exact trusted artifacts produced and validated by the Build Framework.

---

## Phase 8 — Supply Chain Assurance

### Objective

Introduce stronger software supply-chain assurance when FamilyOS maturity and risk justify it.

This is a future maturity phase.

It is not an immediate infrastructure requirement.

---

### Potential Capabilities

Phase 8 may eventually introduce:

* dependency integrity verification;
* toolchain integrity verification;
* stronger isolated build environments;
* artifact signing;
* provenance attestations;
* trusted artifact storage;
* policy-driven build authorization;
* Software Bill of Materials generation;
* supply-chain policy enforcement.

---

## Artifact Provenance

Formal provenance may describe:

```text
Artifact
│
├── Source
├── Builder
├── Dependencies
├── Toolchain
├── Environment
└── Validation
```

This may eventually use industry standards if appropriate.

---

## Artifact Signing

Signing may provide cryptographic assurance that an artifact was approved by an authorized FamilyOS release process.

Signing architecture must preserve separation between:

* build trust;
* release authority.

---

## Software Bill Of Materials

A future SBOM capability may describe artifact dependency composition.

Possible benefits include:

* vulnerability analysis;
* dependency transparency;
* supply-chain visibility.

An SBOM should only be introduced when its operational value is clear.

---

## Provenance Attestations

Future builds may generate machine-verifiable attestations describing how artifacts were produced.

This should extend the existing Build Evidence model.

---

## Trusted Builders

High-trust releases may eventually use controlled build workers with stronger isolation and environment identity.

Such infrastructure should only be adopted when required by platform risk or distribution scale.

---

### Success Criteria

Phase 8 is complete when FamilyOS can cryptographically and operationally demonstrate strong software supply-chain assurance for its official artifacts.

---

## Cross-Phase Capabilities

Some capabilities evolve continuously across all roadmap phases.

These include:

* documentation;
* testing;
* quality;
* security;
* observability;
* governance;
* developer experience.

---

## Documentation Roadmap

Build documentation should evolve together with implementation.

Every introduced capability should update applicable:

* Build Framework chapters;
* engineering documentation;
* CLI reference;
* CI documentation;
* release documentation.

Implementation must not outrun documentation permanently.

---

## Testing Roadmap

Build implementation should gain tests appropriate to its complexity.

Potential areas include:

* configuration resolution;
* build orchestration;
* artifact discovery;
* manifest generation;
* validation;
* failure behavior.

Testing requirements remain aligned with EPIC-TST-001.

---

## Quality Roadmap

The Quality Framework may progressively evaluate:

* build success rate;
* artifact validation;
* reproducibility;
* build duration;
* failure categories;
* evidence completeness.

Metrics should become formal only when useful.

---

## Security Roadmap

Build security should strengthen progressively.

Early stages should focus on:

* explicit dependencies;
* secret separation;
* minimal permissions;
* controlled tooling.

Later stages may add:

* provenance;
* signing;
* isolated builders;
* stronger dependency verification.

---

## Observability Roadmap

Build observability may evolve from simple console output toward structured build results.

The progression may be:

```text
Logs
  ↓
Stage-Aware Logs
  ↓
Structured Build Results
  ↓
Build Metrics
  ↓
Build Evidence
```

---

## Developer Experience Roadmap

Developer experience should improve throughout the roadmap.

The target is:

```text
One Canonical Setup
One Canonical Build
One Canonical Validation Path
Predictable Artifacts
Reproducible CI
```

Advanced build maturity should not make ordinary development unnecessarily complicated.

---

## Governance Roadmap

Governance may evolve from documentation-driven control toward selective automation.

```text
Documented Rules
      ↓
Review
      ↓
Automated Validation
      ↓
Policy Enforcement
```

Automation should only enforce stable and well-understood rules.

---

## Build Framework Implementation Priorities

The implementation sequence SHOULD prioritize high-value capabilities before advanced infrastructure.

A practical priority order is:

```text
1. Canonical Build Command
2. Canonical Environment Setup
3. Canonical Dependency Setup
4. Artifact Output Standardization
5. Artifact Validation
6. CI Automation
7. Build Identity
8. Artifact Integrity
9. Evidence
10. Reproducibility
11. Release Handoff
12. Supply Chain Assurance
```

---

## Priority 1 — Canonical Build Command

The most important implementation capability is a single documented build path.

Without it, downstream automation remains fragmented.

---

## Priority 2 — Environment Reproduction

A fresh supported environment must be able to execute the build.

This removes workstation-specific dependency.

---

## Priority 3 — Dependency Reproducibility

Dependency resolution must become sufficiently controlled to support reliable builds.

---

## Priority 4 — Artifact Validation

FamilyOS should validate the artifact itself, not only the source used to generate it.

---

## Priority 5 — CI Consistency

CI should independently execute the canonical build.

---

## Priority 6 — Evidence

Evidence becomes more valuable after execution and validation have stabilized.

---

## Priority 7 — Strong Reproducibility

Stronger environment and artifact reproducibility should follow only after canonical build semantics are stable.

---

## Priority 8 — Supply Chain Infrastructure

Signing, provenance services, or dedicated artifact infrastructure should come last unless risk changes require earlier adoption.

---

## Roadmap Dependencies

The Build Framework roadmap depends on several existing FamilyOS foundations.

```text
EPIC-ENG-001
      ↓
Engineering Foundation

EPIC-TST-001
      ↓
Testing Capability

EPIC-QLT-001
      ↓
Quality Governance

EPIC-DOC-001
      ↓
Documentation Governance

EPIC-PLUGIN-002
      ↓
Plugin Compliance

EPIC-BLD-001
      ↓
Build Capability

EPIC-REL-001
      ↓
Release Capability
```

---

## Relationship With Release Roadmap

Build and Release roadmaps should evolve together.

Build must establish:

```text
Trusted Artifact
```

before Release can reliably establish:

```text
Trusted Distribution
```

The Release Framework must not compensate indefinitely for weak artifact identity or weak build evidence.

---

## Roadmap Decision Gates

Progress to higher maturity should be driven by evidence.

Before introducing a major capability, FamilyOS should ask:

```text
What problem does this solve?

Is the existing model insufficient?

Is the limitation measurable?

What complexity will be introduced?

Can a simpler mechanism solve it?

How will the capability be maintained?
```

---

## Infrastructure Gate

Advanced infrastructure should only be introduced when:

```text
Observed Engineering Need
        >
Added Complexity And Maintenance Cost
```

This is especially important for:

* remote execution;
* artifact registries;
* signing infrastructure;
* dedicated builders;
* provenance services.

---

## Roadmap Flexibility

The roadmap is directional, not rigid.

FamilyOS may implement capabilities from a later phase earlier if a concrete need requires them.

For example, artifact checksums may be inexpensive and useful before formal Build IDs exist.

The important requirement is architectural consistency.

---

## Roadmap Review

The roadmap should be reviewed when:

* FamilyOS architecture changes;
* new languages are introduced;
* new artifact formats appear;
* release requirements change;
* build failures reveal systemic weaknesses;
* security requirements increase;
* distribution scale increases.

---

## Roadmap Change Governance

Major roadmap changes may require:

* EPIC revision;
* ADR;
* RFC;
* roadmap documentation update.

Routine implementation sequencing changes do not necessarily require formal architecture governance.

---

## Deferred Capabilities

The following capabilities should generally remain deferred until justified:

* custom build language;
* distributed build cluster;
* remote execution service;
* large artifact registry platform;
* mandatory container builds;
* custom dependency mirror;
* custom signing service;
* dedicated provenance platform.

These capabilities are not rejected permanently.

They are deferred until actual platform needs make them valuable.

---

## Non-Goals Of The Roadmap

The roadmap does not attempt to:

* predict exact implementation dates;
* prescribe one CI provider;
* prescribe one future packaging technology;
* require maximal supply-chain infrastructure;
* replace Release Framework planning;
* replace Security Architecture planning;
* make every build bit-for-bit reproducible immediately.

Its purpose is to provide strategic sequencing.

---

## Roadmap Risk — Over-Engineering

The most important roadmap risk is building infrastructure ahead of need.

This can create:

* maintenance burden;
* reduced developer productivity;
* architectural rigidity;
* unnecessary dependencies;
* governance complexity.

The roadmap therefore favors incremental capability.

---

## Roadmap Risk — Under-Engineering

The opposite risk is remaining with informal builds too long.

This can create:

* local/CI divergence;
* non-reproducible artifacts;
* release uncertainty;
* dependency drift;
* artifact ambiguity.

The roadmap balances both risks.

---

## Roadmap Risk — Automation Before Architecture

Automating inconsistent build behavior can make inconsistency harder to remove.

Therefore architecture and standardization precede automation.

---

## Roadmap Risk — CI Lock-In

Build semantics must remain independent from CI provider-specific implementation.

---

## Roadmap Risk — Rebuilding During Release

Rebuilding artifacts downstream weakens traceability.

Phase 7 explicitly addresses this risk.

---

## Roadmap Risk — Evidence Without Action

Collecting extensive build data without using it creates maintenance cost.

Evidence should support:

* validation;
* debugging;
* release;
* security;
* governance.

---

## Roadmap Risk — Permanent Transitional State

Temporary migration paths should not become permanent architecture.

Each transition should have an intended stable destination.

---

## Maturity Assessment

FamilyOS may periodically evaluate Build Framework maturity using questions such as:

```text
Is there one canonical build path?

Can a fresh environment execute it?

Are dependencies controlled?

Are artifacts explicitly identified?

Are artifacts validated?

Does CI reproduce the same build?

Can important builds be traced to source?

Are artifact bytes integrity-protected?

Does Release consume the validated artifact?

Can the build context be reconstructed?
```

---

## Maturity Levels

A simplified maturity model is:

```text
Maturity 1 — Documented
Maturity 2 — Standardized
Maturity 3 — Validated
Maturity 4 — Automated
Maturity 5 — Traceable
Maturity 6 — Reproducible
Maturity 7 — Release-Integrated
Maturity 8 — Supply-Chain Assured
```

---

## Roadmap Exit State

The long-term target state is:

```text
Controlled Source Revision
        ↓
Reproducible Build Context
        ↓
Canonical Automated Build
        ↓
Validated Artifact Set
        ↓
Artifact Identity And Integrity
        ↓
Build Evidence And Provenance
        ↓
Release Handoff
        ↓
Promotion Of Same Trusted Bytes
```

This represents mature Build Framework operation.

---

## Roadmap Success Criteria

The Build Roadmap is successful when it enables FamilyOS to evolve without losing architectural discipline and when each new level of build maturity produces measurable engineering value.

In the mature target state:

1. canonical build behavior is stable;
2. supported environments are reproducible;
3. dependencies are governed;
4. build configuration is explicit;
5. CI implements canonical semantics;
6. artifacts are explicitly identified;
7. artifacts are validated;
8. integrity can be verified;
9. important builds have traceable evidence;
10. release processes consume trusted build outputs;
11. advanced supply-chain controls can be added without architectural redesign;
12. build complexity remains proportional to FamilyOS needs.

---

## Roadmap Summary

The FamilyOS Build Framework roadmap can be summarized as:

```text
Foundation
   ↓
Standardization
   ↓
Validation
   ↓
Automation
   ↓
Artifact Trust
   ↓
Reproducibility
   ↓
Release Integration
   ↓
Supply Chain Assurance
```

Each phase converts another source of build uncertainty into explicit engineering control.

---

## Final Principle

The FamilyOS Build Roadmap is founded on the following rule:

> FamilyOS should build the next level of build maturity only when the current level is stable enough to justify it.

The objective is not to create the most sophisticated build system.

The objective is to create the simplest build system capable of producing trustworthy FamilyOS artifacts at each stage of platform evolution.

EPIC-BLD-001 therefore provides both the architecture for today's build needs and a controlled path toward tomorrow's stronger reproducibility, traceability, release integration, and software supply-chain assurance.
