## Overview

EPIC-BLD-001 establishes the authoritative **FamilyOS Build Framework**.

The framework defines how controlled engineering state is transformed into validated, traceable, reproducible, and trustworthy software artifacts.

It establishes the common architectural model governing:

* build inputs;
* build context;
* project structure;
* build environments;
* toolchains;
* dependencies;
* build configuration;
* build execution;
* artifact production;
* artifact identity;
* artifact validation;
* build evidence;
* reproducibility;
* automation;
* continuous integration;
* governance;
* downstream release handoff.

The Build Framework treats a build as a controlled engineering transformation rather than merely the execution of a build command.

---

## Problem Statement

A software build may appear successful while still producing an artifact that cannot be trusted.

For example:

* the exact source state may be unknown;
* dependencies may be uncontrolled;
* configuration may be implicit;
* tool versions may vary;
* the execution environment may be inconsistent;
* generated output may not be validated;
* artifact integrity may be unknown;
* build provenance may be incomplete;
* CI behavior may differ from local behavior;
* release workflows may rebuild artifacts instead of promoting validated bytes.

Without a coherent Build Framework, FamilyOS cannot reliably answer questions such as:

* What exactly was built?
* From which source revision?
* Which dependencies were resolved?
* Which configuration was effective?
* Which toolchain produced the artifact?
* In which environment was the build executed?
* What artifact was generated?
* Was the artifact validated?
* Is the artifact identical to the one handed to Release?
* What evidence supports the artifact's trust state?

EPIC-BLD-001 establishes the architecture required to answer these questions consistently.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of EPIC-BLD-001 is to establish the canonical FamilyOS build engineering model.

The framework defines a progression from controlled engineering inputs to trusted artifacts:

```text
Controlled Engineering State
        ↓
Build Inputs
        ↓
Build Context Resolution
        ↓
Environment Preparation
        ↓
Dependency Resolution
        ↓
Toolchain Validation
        ↓
Pre-Build Validation
        ↓
Build Execution
        ↓
Candidate Artifact Collection
        ↓
Artifact Validation
        ↓
Build Evidence Generation
        ↓
Trusted Artifact Finalization
        ↓
Release Handoff
```

---

---

## Scope

The Build Framework includes:

* build principles;
* build architecture;
* build lifecycle;
* build inputs;
* input validation;
* project structure as it relates to build behavior;
* build toolchains;
* build environments;
* dependency resolution;
* dependency state;
* build configuration;
* configuration resolution;
* build execution;
* execution stages;
* workspaces;
* artifact production;
* artifact identity;
* artifact integrity;
* artifact validation;
* build evidence;
* artifact provenance;
* build reproducibility;
* CI build execution;
* build automation;
* build governance;
* release handoff;
* future supply-chain assurance.

---

## Non-Goals

EPIC-BLD-001 does not own:

* release authorization;
* release version selection;
* release publication;
* software distribution;
* deployment;
* runtime orchestration;
* testing methodology;
* quality policy;
* documentation governance;
* plugin compliance policy;
* security architecture;
* operations architecture.

Those responsibilities remain with their respective FamilyOS frameworks.

The Build Framework may integrate with specialized capabilities but SHALL NOT silently absorb their architectural ownership.

---

## Build Principles

The Build Framework follows several foundational principles.

### Builds Must Start From Identifiable State

A trustworthy build begins from known engineering state.

Relevant inputs should be identifiable and traceable.

---

### Build Inputs Must Be Explicit

Build-relevant inputs SHALL NOT depend unnecessarily on hidden local state.

Inputs may include:

* source revision;
* configuration;
* dependencies;
* toolchain;
* environment;
* build profile;
* applicable policies;
* generated prerequisites.

---

### Build Configuration Must Be Deterministic

The effective build configuration should be explainable.

Configuration precedence and overrides should be explicit.

---

### Build Environments Must Be Controlled

Build environments should be:

* identifiable;
* reproducible where required;
* isolated where appropriate;
* intentionally versioned;
* validated according to risk.

---

### Build Toolchains Must Be Governed

Critical tools should be identifiable and version-controlled where practical.

Toolchain drift SHALL NOT silently change build semantics.

---

### Dependencies Must Be Controlled

Dependency state is part of the build context.

Dependency resolution should be reproducible and traceable where required.

---

### Build Execution Must Be Observable

Build execution should provide sufficient information to understand:

* which stages ran;
* which stages succeeded;
* which stages failed;
* which outputs were generated;
* what evidence was produced.

---

### Build Success Is Not Artifact Trust

A successful build command only demonstrates that execution completed according to process-level expectations.

It does not automatically establish artifact trust.

---

### Artifacts Must Be Validated

Generated output becomes trustworthy only after the relevant artifact validation succeeds.

---

### Trusted Bytes Should Be Promoted

Downstream workflows should prefer promotion of the exact validated artifact rather than rebuilding it differently.

---

## Canonical Build Model

The canonical Build Framework model is:

```text
Source State
    +
Configuration
    +
Dependencies
    +
Toolchain
    +
Environment
    +
Build Profile
    +
Applicable Policies
        ↓
Resolved Build Context
        ↓
Build Execution
        ↓
Candidate Artifacts
        ↓
Artifact Validation
        ↓
Build Evidence
        ↓
Trusted Artifact Set
        ↓
Release Framework
```

---

## Build Context

The Build Context represents the resolved engineering state required to execute a build.

It may include:

```text
source_state
effective_configuration
dependency_state
toolchain_state
environment_state
build_profile
applicable_policies
```

The Build Context should be sufficiently explicit to support:

* traceability;
* reproducibility;
* validation;
* diagnostics;
* governance.

---

## Build Profiles

Initial Build Profiles may include:

```text
development
validation
ci
release-candidate
```

Profiles may define context-specific build expectations while preserving the canonical architecture.

A profile SHALL NOT create a fundamentally separate build architecture.

---

## Build Lifecycle

The canonical Build Lifecycle is:

```text
Build Inputs
      ↓
Build Context Resolution
      ↓
Environment Preparation
      ↓
Dependency Resolution
      ↓
Toolchain Validation
      ↓
Pre-Build Validation
      ↓
Build Execution
      ↓
Candidate Artifact Collection
      ↓
Artifact Validation
      ↓
Build Evidence Generation
      ↓
Trusted Artifact Finalization
      ↓
Release Handoff
```

Lifecycle stages may be automated progressively.

Their semantic responsibilities should remain stable even when implementation mechanisms evolve.

---

## Build Inputs

Build inputs may include:

* source files;
* source revision;
* manifests;
* dependency declarations;
* lock files;
* build scripts;
* configuration;
* environment definitions;
* toolchain declarations;
* policy information;
* generated prerequisites.

Inputs should be:

* identifiable;
* controlled;
* validated where appropriate;
* traceable.

---

## Project Structure

The Build Framework defines project-structure expectations only where those expectations materially affect build behavior.

Project structure should make important build inputs and outputs understandable.

The framework SHALL NOT define arbitrary repository organization unrelated to build semantics.

---

## Build Toolchain

The Build Toolchain contains tools required to execute or validate a build.

Examples may include:

* compilers;
* interpreters;
* package managers;
* build systems;
* generators;
* packaging tools;
* artifact tools;
* validation tools.

Critical tool versions should be identifiable where tool variation may affect build behavior or artifact identity.

---

## Build Environment

A Build Environment is the execution context in which build operations occur.

Environment state may include:

* operating system;
* runtime;
* environment variables;
* toolchain;
* filesystem assumptions;
* container identity;
* external services;
* credentials;
* resource constraints.

Environment differences that affect artifact output or trust should be controlled.

---

## Dependency Management

Dependencies are part of the effective build context.

The Build Framework expects dependency management to support:

* explicit declarations;
* controlled resolution;
* reproducibility where required;
* integrity verification where available;
* version traceability;
* governance of dependency changes.

Dependency architecture may also interact with security and supply-chain requirements.

---

## Build Configuration

Build Configuration determines how a build executes.

Configuration sources may include:

* repository configuration;
* Build Profiles;
* environment configuration;
* controlled overrides;
* CLI parameters;
* CI parameters.

The effective configuration should be derivable and explainable.

---

## Build Philosophy

FamilyOS treats builds as controlled transformations.

The central trust progression is:

```text
Successful Execution
        ↓
Generated Output
        ↓
Candidate Artifact
        ↓
Validated Artifact
        ↓
Trusted Artifact
```

These states SHALL NOT be collapsed into a single notion of "build success."

---

## Build Execution

Build Execution performs the controlled transformation represented by the Build Context.

Build execution should define:

* entry conditions;
* stages;
* workspaces;
* sequencing;
* failure semantics;
* output collection;
* cleanup expectations;
* observability;
* evidence capture.

Execution SHOULD behave consistently between developer environments and CI where practical.

---

## Artifact Model

The canonical artifact states are:

```text
raw_output
candidate_artifact
validated_artifact
trusted_artifact
```

An artifact may progress through these states only when corresponding requirements are satisfied.

---

## Artifact Identity

A build artifact should be identifiable.

Artifact identity may include:

* artifact name;
* artifact type;
* version where applicable;
* Build ID;
* source revision;
* artifact digest;
* platform;
* architecture;
* build profile;
* provenance metadata.

---

## Artifact Integrity

Artifact integrity should correspond to the actual final bytes.

After an artifact is validated and treated as trusted, modifying its bytes invalidates the previous integrity relationship.

Downstream release workflows SHOULD use the same validated bytes.

---

## Artifact Management

Artifact Management governs:

* artifact collection;
* classification;
* naming;
* identity;
* metadata;
* integrity;
* storage;
* validation state;
* retention;
* provenance;
* promotion;
* release handoff.

Artifacts SHALL NOT be trusted merely because they exist.

---

## Build Validation

Build Validation establishes whether relevant build requirements have been satisfied.

Validation may cover:

* build inputs;
* resolved configuration;
* toolchain;
* environment;
* dependency state;
* execution;
* candidate artifacts;
* artifact identity;
* artifact integrity;
* required evidence.

`15-Build-Validation.md` owns detailed validation of individual builds and artifacts.

---

## Framework Validation

Framework validation is distinct from Build Validation.

`20-Validation.md` defines validation of EPIC-BLD-001 itself.

The distinction is:

```text
15-Build-Validation.md
        ↓
Individual Build / Artifact Validation

20-Validation.md
        ↓
Build Framework Validation

VALIDATION.md
        ↓
Actual Framework Validation Evidence
```

---

## Build Evidence

Build Evidence records how an artifact was produced.

Evidence may include:

* source revision;
* Build ID;
* effective configuration;
* dependency state;
* environment identity;
* toolchain identity;
* execution results;
* validation results;
* artifact inventory;
* artifact digests;
* provenance;
* timestamps.

Evidence should support explanation and traceability.

---

## Build ID

A future executable Build Framework may define a canonical Build ID.

A Build ID should identify a specific controlled build execution or build result.

It may support:

* traceability;
* artifact correlation;
* evidence correlation;
* diagnostics;
* release handoff;
* auditability.

---

## Build Reproducibility

Reproducibility is the ability to reproduce expected build behavior or artifact output under controlled conditions.

Different levels of reproducibility may be required for different artifact classes.

The Build Framework should support progressive reproducibility maturity.

---

## Build Automation

Automation should execute canonical Build Framework semantics.

Automation SHALL NOT become the architecture itself.

The governing principle is:

> CI executes the Build Framework; CI does not define the Build Framework.

---

## Continuous Integration

CI should align with local and canonical build semantics.

CI may automate:

* environment preparation;
* dependency resolution;
* toolchain validation;
* build execution;
* artifact collection;
* validation;
* evidence production;
* artifact publication to internal storage;
* downstream release handoff.

CI-specific optimizations SHALL NOT silently alter artifact trust semantics.

---

## Cache Policy

Caches may improve performance.

Caches SHALL be treated as optional optimizations rather than authoritative build state.

Cache corruption or absence should not silently produce untraceable or inconsistent build semantics.

---

## Build Security Boundary

The Build Framework may consume security requirements and evidence.

Security architecture remains owned by the Security Framework.

Build jobs should follow security principles such as:

* least privilege;
* controlled credentials;
* separation of build and release authority;
* protected secret handling;
* dependency integrity;
* artifact integrity.

Release credentials SHOULD remain separated from ordinary build jobs.

---

## Build Governance

Build Governance defines how Build Framework changes are managed.

Change classes may include:

```text
routine
significant
architectural
strategic
```

Governance mechanisms may include:

* code review;
* documentation review;
* technical review;
* ADR;
* RFC;
* EPIC revision;
* quality review;
* security review.

---

## Build and Testing Boundary

The Build Framework may invoke tests as part of build readiness.

The Testing Framework owns testing architecture, levels, semantics, test design, and test evidence.

The Build Framework consumes testing evidence where required.

---

## Build and Quality Boundary

The Build Framework may invoke quality gates or consume quality evidence.

The Quality Framework owns quality policy, Quality Rules, Quality Profiles, assessments, and Quality Gate semantics.

Build does not redefine quality governance.

---

## Build and Documentation Boundary

The Documentation Framework owns documentation architecture and documentation standards.

The Build Framework may validate build-relevant documentation requirements without becoming the documentation-governance authority.

---

## Build and Plugin Compliance Boundary

The Plugin Compliance Framework owns plugin-specific compliance requirements.

The Build Framework may consume plugin compliance evidence where required by a build profile or release handoff.

---

## Build and Release Boundary

The Build Framework produces trusted artifacts.

The Release Framework evaluates, promotes, publishes, distributes, and governs releases.

The separation is:

```text
Build Framework
      ↓
Trusted Artifact Set
      ↓
Build Evidence
      ↓
Release Handoff
      ↓
Release Framework
      ↓
Release Candidate
      ↓
Release Approval
      ↓
Publication
```

Build SHALL NOT silently become Release.

---

## Release Handoff

The Build Framework may provide downstream Release with:

```text
trusted artifact set
Build ID
artifact manifest
artifact digests
validation result
Build Evidence
provenance information
```

The Release Framework may then determine whether those artifacts are eligible for release progression.

---

## Trusted Artifact Promotion

FamilyOS should prefer:

```text
Build
   ↓
Validate
   ↓
Trust
   ↓
Promote Same Bytes
   ↓
Release
```

rather than:

```text
Build
   ↓
Validate
   ↓
Rebuild Differently
   ↓
Publish Unvalidated Replacement
```

This distinction is fundamental to artifact trust.

---

## Supply-Chain Direction

The Build Framework establishes foundations for future software supply-chain assurance.

Future capabilities may include:

* stronger provenance;
* signed evidence;
* signed artifacts;
* dependency attestations;
* SBOM integration;
* hermetic builds;
* reproducible builds;
* artifact verification;
* protected builders;
* policy-driven supply-chain gates.

These capabilities belong to future maturity phases unless explicitly implemented.

---

## Canonical Documentation

EPIC-BLD-001 contains exactly **24 numbered documents**:

```text
00-EPIC.md
01-Context.md
02-Vision.md
03-Build-Principles.md
04-Build-Architecture.md
05-Build-Lifecycle.md
06-Build-Input-Requirements.md
07-Build-Inputs-and-Project-Structure.md
08-Build-Toolchain.md
09-Build-Environment-Management.md
10-Dependency-Management.md
11-Build-Configuration.md
12-Build-Philosophy.md

18-Roadmap.md
19-References.md
20-Validation.md
21-Summary.md
22-Release.md
23-Implementation-Checklist.md
```

The framework also contains seven control documents:

```text
EPIC-BLD-001.md
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

Canonical total:

```text
24 numbered documents
+
7 control documents
=
31 canonical files
```

---

## Canonical Structure

The machine-readable canonical structure is:

```yaml
structure:
  numbered_documents: 24
  canonical_document_range: "00-23"
  control_documents: 7
  canonical_files: 31
```

This structure SHALL remain synchronized with `MANIFEST.md` and the physical repository.

---

## Framework Relationships

EPIC-BLD-001 depends on foundational engineering frameworks including:

* `EPIC-ENG-001` — Engineering Foundation;
* `EPIC-DOC-001` — Documentation Foundation;
* `EPIC-TST-001` — Testing Framework;
* `EPIC-QLT-001` — Quality Framework.

It integrates with:

* `EPIC-REL-001` — Release Framework;
* `EPIC-OBS-001` — Observability Framework;
* `EPIC-SEC-001` — Security Framework;
* `EPIC-OPS-001` — Operations Framework.

The Build Framework SHALL preserve explicit ownership boundaries with each of these frameworks.

---

## Roadmap

The Build Framework roadmap progresses through:

```text
Build Foundation
        ↓
Build Standardization
        ↓
Build Validation
        ↓
Build Automation
        ↓
Artifact Trust
        ↓
Reproducibility and Traceability
        ↓
Release Integration
        ↓
Supply-Chain Assurance
```

Future roadmap capabilities do not imply current implementation.

---

## Implementation Direction

Expected implementation directions include:

* canonical build interface;
* environment standardization;
* dependency standardization;
* configuration standardization;
* canonical execution;
* artifact management;
* artifact validation;
* CI integration;
* Build ID;
* Build Evidence;
* release handoff;
* reproducibility;
* supply-chain assurance.

Detailed implementation progression belongs in:

```text
23-Implementation-Checklist.md
```

---

## Completion Criteria

EPIC-BLD-001 is structurally complete when:

* exactly 24 numbered documents exist;
* numbering is continuous from `00` through `23`;
* all seven control documents exist;
* all 31 canonical files are present;
* no required canonical document is empty;
* `EPIC.yaml` and `MANIFEST.md` agree with the filesystem.

The framework is validation-complete when:

* YAML parsing succeeds;
* canonical inventory validation succeeds;
* references are valid;
* terminology is coherent;
* Build Architecture is coherent;
* Build Lifecycle is coherent;
* artifact terminology is coherent;
* framework boundaries are explicit;
* governance semantics are coherent;
* repository quality gates pass;
* actual validation evidence is recorded.

---

## Historical Publication

EPIC-BLD-001 version `1.0.0` was historically completed and published under:

```text
v4.7.0-build-framework
```

Historical publication commit:

```text
1b457dd86ae4c94033fa29b96b4e6db135202171
```

The historical publication tag is immutable.

It SHALL NOT be moved to a later post-release normalization commit.

---

## Historical Tag Policy

The historical tag:

```text
v4.7.0-build-framework
```

represents the original published Build Framework repository state.

Later corrections SHALL be represented by later commits.

This preserves:

* historical traceability;
* release integrity;
* repository chronology;
* reproducibility of historical release state.

---

## Post-Release Revalidation

The canonical Build Framework is currently undergoing post-release revalidation.

The purpose is to:

* normalize machine-readable metadata;
* synchronize control documents;
* verify the 31-file canonical inventory;
* execute current repository quality gates;
* validate active state consistency;
* verify framework boundaries;
* record current validation evidence;
* preserve historical publication integrity.

Historical publication remains valid, and current repository revalidation has completed successfully.

---

## Revalidation Evidence Policy

Only actual execution evidence may convert a revalidation requirement from `PENDING` to `PASS`.

For example:

```text
ruff check .
mypy src
pytest -q
git diff --check
```

must actually be executed against the repository state being validated.

Historical results SHALL NOT automatically be treated as current evidence.

---

## Current Framework State

```text
EPIC:                  EPIC-BLD-001
Framework:             Build Framework
Version:               1.0.0
Status:                Completed
Owner:                 FamilyOS Engineering

Numbered Documents:    24
Control Documents:     7
Canonical Files:       31
Canonical Range:       00 → 23

Historical Publication: Published
Historical Tag:         v4.7.0-build-framework
Historical Tag Policy:  Immutable

Current Activity:       Final Implementation Validation Completed
Repository Revalidation: Validated
Final Revalidation:      Validated
```

---

## Current Validation

The canonical structure has been established.

The current post-release revalidation must still record current evidence for:

* YAML contract validation;
* filesystem inventory;
* numbering integrity;
* control document integrity;
* active state consistency;
* reference integrity;
* semantic consistency;
* framework-boundary validation;
* governance consistency;
* Ruff;
* MyPy;
* Pytest;
* repository diff validation;
* historical tag verification.

The authoritative current evidence record is:

```text
VALIDATION.md
```

Until that evidence is complete, the machine-readable revalidation state remains:

```yaml
repository_validation_status: pending_revalidation
final_validation_status: pending_revalidation
```

---

## Release State

Framework version `1.0.0` is historically **Completed** and **Published**.

Historical publication:

```text
v4.7.0-build-framework
```

Current post-release normalization does not create a new Build Framework release.

It does not move or rewrite the historical publication tag.

A future Build Framework release SHALL use the applicable FamilyOS Release Framework governance.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

EPIC-BLD-001 satisfies its canonical documentation baseline when:

* [x] 24 numbered documents are defined.
* [x] Seven control documents are defined.
* [x] The canonical total is 31 files.
* [x] The canonical range is `00 → 23`.

---

## Risks

The Build Framework must continue to mitigate several architectural risks.

### Implicit Build Inputs

Hidden build inputs can undermine reproducibility and trust.

Mitigation:

Make build-relevant inputs identifiable and governed.

---

### Toolchain Drift

Uncontrolled tool variation may change outputs.

Mitigation:

Identify and govern critical tool versions.

---

### Environment Drift

Different environments may produce inconsistent behavior or artifacts.

Mitigation:

Control build environment assumptions.

---

### Dependency Drift

Uncontrolled dependency resolution may make builds non-reproducible.

Mitigation:

Use controlled dependency declarations and resolution.

---

### Artifact Mutation

Changing validated artifact bytes invalidates prior trust.

Mitigation:

Treat validated artifacts as immutable and promote exact validated bytes.

---

### Build / Release Coupling

Build automation may accidentally absorb release authority.

Mitigation:

Maintain explicit Build and Release ownership boundaries.

---

### CI as Architecture

CI configuration may become the de facto build model.

Mitigation:

Keep canonical build semantics independent of a particular automation platform.

---

## Success Criteria

The Build Framework succeeds when FamilyOS can consistently answer:

```text
What source state was built?

What configuration was effective?

Which dependencies were used?

Which toolchain executed?

Which environment executed the build?

Which stages ran?

Which artifacts were produced?

Which artifacts were validated?

What evidence supports their trust?

Which exact bytes were handed to Release?
```

---

## Final Principle

The defining Build Framework principle is:

> FamilyOS does not trust software because a build command succeeded. FamilyOS trusts an artifact when the process that produced it is controlled, the artifact itself has been validated, and sufficient evidence exists to understand its origin.

---

## Final State

```text
EPIC:                   EPIC-BLD-001
Title:                  Build Framework
Framework Version:      1.0.0
Framework Status:       Completed

Canonical Range:        00 → 23
Numbered Documents:     24
Control Documents:      7
Canonical Files:        31

Historical Publication: Published
Historical Tag:         v4.7.0-build-framework
Historical Tag Commit:  1b457dd86ae4c94033fa29b96b4e6db135202171
Historical Tag Policy:  Immutable

Current Activity:       Final Implementation Validation Completed
Repository Validation:  Validated
Final Revalidation:      Validated
```

EPIC-BLD-001 establishes the canonical FamilyOS Build Framework and the architectural foundation required for reproducible builds, trustworthy artifacts, deterministic automation, release integration, and future software supply-chain assurance.
