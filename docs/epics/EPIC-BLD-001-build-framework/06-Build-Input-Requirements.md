# Build Framework

## 06 Build Input Requirements

### Overview

EPIC-BLD-001 — Build Framework defines the requirements governing all engineering inputs capable of influencing a FamilyOS build.

Build inputs are not limited to source code.

Any data, configuration, dependency, generated content, environment property, toolchain element, or policy capable of materially changing build behavior must be treated as part of the effective build input model.

The purpose of this document is to define how build inputs are identified, classified, validated, controlled, traced, and maintained.

The central principle is:

> A trusted build requires trusted and explainable inputs.

---

## Purpose

The Build Input Requirements establish the minimum engineering expectations that must be satisfied before FamilyOS build execution can be considered reliable.

These requirements apply to:

* source inputs;
* configuration inputs;
* dependency inputs;
* generated inputs;
* metadata inputs;
* toolchain inputs;
* environment inputs;
* policy inputs;
* build-profile inputs.

The objective is to prevent significant build behavior from depending on hidden or uncontrolled state.

---

## Build Input Definition

A build input is any element capable of materially affecting the result of a build.

Conceptually:

```text id="6vlr0h"
Build Input
    ↓
Influences
    ↓
Build Behavior
    ↓
Artifact
```

An input may be:

* directly consumed;
* indirectly resolved;
* generated before execution;
* provided through configuration;
* inherited from the environment;
* introduced through tooling.

If changing an element may change the resulting artifact or validation result, that element should be considered part of the effective build context.

---

## Build Input Model

The canonical FamilyOS build input model is:

```text id="v03g5z"
Build Inputs
│
├── Source Inputs
├── Configuration Inputs
├── Dependency Inputs
├── Generated Inputs
├── Metadata Inputs
├── Toolchain Inputs
├── Environment Inputs
├── Policy Inputs
└── Profile Inputs
```

Each category has different governance and validation requirements.

---

## Requirement 1 — Inputs Must Be Identifiable

Significant build inputs MUST be identifiable.

The build system should be able to determine what inputs participated in a build.

The preferred model is:

```text id="fcs9vy"
Known Inputs
    ↓
Known Build
```

The undesirable model is:

```text id="pjq20b"
Unknown Inputs
      ↓
Unknown Influence
      ↓
Build
```

---

## Requirement 2 — Inputs Must Be Explicit Where Practical

FamilyOS SHOULD make build inputs explicit wherever technically feasible.

Explicit inputs are easier to:

* review;
* validate;
* reproduce;
* document;
* automate;
* govern.

Hidden state should be progressively eliminated.

---

## Requirement 3 — Authoritative Inputs Must Be Controlled

Authoritative build inputs SHOULD originate from controlled engineering sources.

The repository is the primary source of controlled FamilyOS engineering state.

Examples include:

* source code;
* project configuration;
* dependency declarations;
* schemas;
* templates;
* build scripts;
* manifests;
* packaging metadata.

Where possible, authoritative definitions should therefore be version controlled.

---

## Requirement 4 — Build Inputs Must Be Traceable

Significant inputs SHOULD be traceable to their origin.

Traceability may include:

* repository path;
* source revision;
* dependency source;
* generator source;
* tool version;
* configuration source.

This creates the relationship:

```text id="kp3q1o"
Artifact
   ↓
Build
   ↓
Input
   ↓
Origin
```

---

## Requirement 5 — Inputs Must Be Validated Before Use

Invalid build inputs SHOULD be rejected before expensive execution begins.

Validation may include:

* presence checks;
* syntax validation;
* schema validation;
* metadata validation;
* compatibility checks;
* version checks;
* policy checks.

Invalid inputs must not silently propagate into artifact generation.

---

## Source Inputs

Source inputs represent implementation or content directly controlled by the FamilyOS repository.

Examples include:

* Python source;
* package source;
* plugin source;
* documentation source;
* templates;
* schemas;
* static resources;
* configuration definitions.

Source inputs are typically the most visible build inputs.

---

## Source Input Requirements

Source inputs SHOULD:

* reside in predictable locations;
* follow FamilyOS project structure;
* comply with applicable coding or documentation standards;
* be identifiable through version control;
* avoid hidden generated dependencies;
* remain compatible with canonical tooling.

---

## Source State

The state of the repository may itself influence build trust.

Relevant state may include:

* current revision;
* branch;
* dirty working tree;
* untracked files;
* staged changes.

Not every build profile requires the same source-state restrictions.

---

## Development Source State

Development builds may allow:

```text id="6nyqwd"
Tracked Changes
Uncommitted Changes
Untracked Development Files
```

provided these inputs remain understandable.

---

## Release Candidate Source State

A release-candidate build SHOULD normally require stricter source state.

Possible requirements include:

* identifiable commit;
* clean working tree;
* no uncontrolled local modifications;
* no required untracked inputs.

This strengthens reproducibility and traceability.

---

## Configuration Inputs

Configuration controls build behavior.

Examples include:

* `pyproject.toml`;
* build profiles;
* tool configuration;
* package metadata;
* generation configuration;
* plugin configuration.

Configuration is a first-class build input.

---

## Configuration Input Requirements

Build configuration SHOULD be:

* explicit;
* version-controlled where practical;
* reviewable;
* documented;
* validated;
* consistent with supported profiles.

Configuration must not silently depend on undocumented machine state.

---

## Configuration Source Priority

When multiple configuration sources exist, precedence must be explicit.

A conceptual model may be:

```text id="pr4m2x"
Framework Defaults
      ↓
Repository Configuration
      ↓
Profile Configuration
      ↓
Explicit Invocation Overrides
```

Environment overrides should be used cautiously.

---

## Dependency Inputs

Dependencies are external build inputs that materially influence output.

Examples include:

* runtime dependencies;
* build dependencies;
* development dependencies;
* plugin dependencies;
* validation dependencies.

Dependency declarations form part of the effective build state.

---

## Dependency Input Requirements

Dependencies MUST be:

* explicitly declared;
* version-governed;
* resolvable;
* compatible;
* traceable where practical;
* subject to applicable security controls.

Mutable, undeclared dependencies should not become hidden build requirements.

---

## Dependency Lock State

Where dependency locking is supported and appropriate, lock state SHOULD participate in reproducible builds.

The relationship is:

```text id="l5bw4j"
Dependency Declaration
        +
Lock State
        ↓
Resolved Dependency Set
```

Release-oriented builds may require stricter dependency reproducibility than development builds.

---

## Generated Inputs

Generated inputs are build inputs produced by another controlled process.

Examples may include:

* generated source;
* generated schemas;
* generated manifests;
* generated metadata;
* generated documentation fragments.

Generated inputs require explicit governance because they introduce another transformation step.

---

## Generated Input Requirements

A generated input SHOULD have:

* known source;
* known generator;
* known generation rules;
* predictable destination;
* validation;
* reproducibility expectations.

The framework should avoid:

```text id="57w1ks"
Generated Input
      ↓
Unknown Origin
```

---

## Generated Input Freshness

Generated inputs may become stale when their authoritative source changes.

Where this risk exists, the build process SHOULD detect stale generated state.

Possible mechanisms include:

* regeneration;
* checksum comparison;
* source-to-output validation;
* generated-state validation.

The exact mechanism depends on implementation maturity.

---

## Metadata Inputs

Build metadata influences artifact identity and packaging.

Examples include:

* project name;
* version context;
* package description;
* plugin metadata;
* manifests;
* classifiers;
* artifact type declarations.

Metadata must be treated as controlled engineering input.

---

## Metadata Requirements

Metadata SHOULD be:

* syntactically valid;
* semantically valid;
* internally consistent;
* compatible with packaging rules;
* compatible with release expectations.

Invalid metadata should fail before artifact publication.

---

## Toolchain Inputs

The build toolchain also acts as an input.

Examples include:

* Python runtime;
* package builder;
* dependency manager;
* code generator;
* documentation generator;
* validation tool.

Different tool versions may produce different results.

---

## Toolchain Input Requirements

Significant toolchain elements SHOULD have:

* known identity;
* supported version range;
* compatibility expectations;
* documented purpose.

Release-candidate builds may require stricter version identification.

---

## Environment Inputs

Environment state can influence build behavior.

Examples include:

* operating system;
* architecture;
* environment variables;
* shell state;
* filesystem paths;
* locale;
* network availability;
* permissions.

Environment influence must be minimized and controlled.

---

## Environment Input Requirements

Environment inputs SHOULD be:

* minimized;
* explicitly documented when required;
* validated;
* excluded from artifact content unless intentional.

The build must avoid accidental dependency on developer-specific state.

---

## Environment Variables

Environment variables may be used for:

* explicit build parameters;
* CI context;
* secrets;
* platform-specific behavior.

Their use must remain disciplined.

Critical build semantics should not rely on undocumented variables.

---

## Secret Inputs

Secrets require special treatment.

Examples include:

* tokens;
* registry credentials;
* signing credentials;
* private keys.

Secrets MUST NOT be treated as ordinary artifact inputs.

They should:

* be minimally exposed;
* remain outside version control;
* not appear in build logs;
* not be embedded unintentionally in artifacts.

---

## Policy Inputs

Policies may influence whether a build is valid.

Policy sources may include:

* Quality Framework;
* Security Architecture;
* Plugin Compliance Framework;
* repository governance;
* Release Framework.

Policies are build inputs when they influence validation decisions.

---

## Policy Input Requirements

Policy state SHOULD be:

* identifiable;
* applicable to the build profile;
* versioned or traceable where practical;
* applied consistently.

A build should not silently apply an unknown policy set.

---

## Profile Inputs

Build profiles specialize build behavior.

Examples include:

* development;
* validation;
* CI;
* documentation;
* plugin;
* release candidate.

The selected profile is itself a significant input.

---

## Profile Requirements

A build profile SHOULD define:

* purpose;
* required inputs;
* validation strictness;
* artifact expectations;
* evidence requirements;
* environment restrictions.

Profile selection must be explicit.

---

## Input Classification

Inputs should be classified according to their role.

A canonical classification is:

```text id="uu4sfv"
Authoritative
Derived
Environmental
External
Sensitive
```

Classification supports different handling requirements.

---

## Authoritative Inputs

Authoritative inputs represent engineering truth.

Examples include:

* source files;
* configuration;
* dependency declarations;
* schemas.

These are typically version controlled.

---

## Derived Inputs

Derived inputs are generated from authoritative inputs.

Examples include:

* generated source;
* generated metadata;
* compiled intermediates.

Derived inputs must not silently become new authoritative truth.

---

## Environmental Inputs

Environmental inputs originate from execution context.

Examples include:

* runtime version;
* OS;
* environment variables.

These should be controlled.

---

## External Inputs

External inputs originate outside the repository.

Examples include:

* downloaded dependencies;
* external schemas;
* remote package metadata.

Their origin and integrity may require validation.

---

## Sensitive Inputs

Sensitive inputs include secrets or protected information.

These require special handling and should not become ordinary build evidence.

---

## Input Ownership

Every significant build input category SHOULD have clear ownership.

Ownership may belong to:

* application engineering;
* framework maintainers;
* plugin maintainers;
* build maintainers;
* security governance;
* release governance.

Unowned inputs tend to become unmanaged dependencies.

---

## Input Lifecycle

Build inputs have their own lifecycle.

```text id="k7ojhi"
Define
  ↓
Store
  ↓
Validate
  ↓
Consume
  ↓
Change
  ↓
Review
  ↓
Retire
```

This lifecycle should remain compatible with build governance.

---

## Input Change Management

Changes to build inputs may affect artifact behavior.

Examples include:

* dependency update;
* configuration change;
* toolchain version change;
* schema change;
* packaging metadata change.

Significant changes should be reviewed according to impact.

---

## Input Compatibility

Inputs may interact in incompatible combinations.

Examples include:

```text id="v2b86h"
Runtime Version
      +
Dependency Version
      ↓
Compatibility
```

or:

```text id="vp7o0b"
Build Profile
      +
Configuration
      ↓
Compatibility
```

The build process should detect invalid combinations.

---

## Input Validation Layers

Input validation may operate at multiple levels.

```text id="0q0u9w"
Presence
   ↓
Syntax
   ↓
Structure
   ↓
Semantic Validity
   ↓
Compatibility
   ↓
Policy Compliance
```

The required depth depends on input type.

---

## Presence Validation

Presence validation confirms required input exists.

Examples include:

* project metadata;
* required configuration;
* dependency declaration;
* source directory.

---

## Syntax Validation

Syntax validation confirms parsability.

Examples include:

* TOML;
* YAML;
* JSON;
* Python syntax;
* manifest syntax.

---

## Structural Validation

Structural validation confirms expected organization.

Examples include:

* required metadata fields;
* project directories;
* package layout;
* plugin structure.

---

## Semantic Validation

Semantic validation confirms that valid syntax also represents meaningful state.

For example:

```text id="9yv79h"
version = "not-a-valid-version"
```

may be syntactically valid TOML but semantically invalid for packaging.

---

## Compatibility Validation

Compatibility validation checks whether inputs can operate together.

Examples include:

* runtime and dependency compatibility;
* profile and target compatibility;
* plugin metadata and platform version compatibility.

---

## Policy Validation

Policy validation ensures inputs comply with applicable governance requirements.

Examples may include:

* prohibited dependency;
* required metadata;
* plugin compliance rule;
* release profile requirement.

---

## Input Fingerprinting

FamilyOS may eventually use fingerprints or hashes to identify build inputs.

A conceptual fingerprint could cover:

```text id="f76efa"
Source
Configuration
Dependencies
Toolchain
```

This may strengthen cache safety, reproducibility, and provenance.

It is a future capability rather than an immediate universal requirement.

---

## Input Immutability

Inputs should remain stable during a build.

Changing significant input state while execution is in progress creates ambiguity.

The preferred model is:

```text id="qn3n9l"
Resolve Inputs
      ↓
Freeze Effective Context
      ↓
Execute
```

Where immutable infrastructure is not available, the build should at least avoid intentional concurrent mutation.

---

## Input Snapshot Concept

A build may conceptually operate on an input snapshot.

```text id="9o9ztq"
Repository State
Configuration
Dependency State
Toolchain
Environment
      ↓
Build Snapshot
```

This snapshot may be logical rather than physical.

---

## Network Inputs

Network access introduces mutable external state.

Examples include:

* dependency downloads;
* remote schemas;
* API-driven generation;
* package indexes.

Network dependency should be explicit.

---

## Network Input Requirements

Where network access influences build output:

* the dependency must be documented;
* failure behavior should be explicit;
* mutable remote content should be minimized;
* release builds should prefer controlled resolution where practical.

---

## External Artifact Inputs

A build may consume artifacts produced by another build.

Examples include:

* shared libraries;
* plugin bundles;
* generated schemas.

Such artifacts should be identifiable and validated before consumption.

---

## Cross-Build Input Model

```text id="e4qu3c"
Build A
   ↓
Validated Artifact
   ↓
Input To Build B
```

Build B must not assume upstream artifacts are trustworthy without evidence.

---

## Input Path Requirements

Build input paths should be predictable.

Absolute developer-specific paths should be avoided.

The preferred model is:

```text id="o0f7fa"
Repository-Relative Path
```

rather than:

```text id="l5wp40"
/Users/specific-user/local/path
```

This improves portability.

---

## Input Naming

Significant build inputs should follow clear naming conventions.

Names should communicate:

* purpose;
* scope;
* format;
* ownership.

Ambiguous names reduce maintainability.

---

## Input Documentation

Build input requirements must be documented where they are not self-evident.

Documentation should explain:

* what the input is;
* why it is required;
* where it comes from;
* how it is validated;
* which profiles consume it.

---

## Input Discoverability

Engineers should be able to determine the build inputs without reading every implementation detail.

Discoverability may be provided through:

* documented project structure;
* configuration files;
* build manifests;
* CLI inspection commands;
* generated context reports.

---

## Input Minimalism

Builds should avoid unnecessary inputs.

Every additional input increases:

* complexity;
* reproducibility risk;
* security surface;
* maintenance effort.

The principle is:

```text id="i7vdd2"
Required Input
      ↓
Keep

Unnecessary Input
      ↓
Remove
```

---

## Hidden Input Anti-Pattern

A hidden input influences behavior without being explicitly represented.

Examples include:

* developer shell aliases;
* undeclared local packages;
* invisible environment variables;
* manually generated files;
* machine-specific paths.

Hidden inputs are incompatible with strong build reproducibility.

---

## Mutable External Input Anti-Pattern

A build should avoid depending on remote content that can change without version identification.

For example:

```text id="4qob4i"
latest-config.json
```

retrieved dynamically without integrity or version control introduces uncontrolled state.

---

## Unvalidated Generated Input Anti-Pattern

Generated content must not be consumed simply because a file exists.

The build should know:

* who generated it;
* from which source;
* whether it is current;
* whether it is valid.

---

## Local-Only Input Anti-Pattern

A required input must not exist only on one contributor's machine.

If the canonical build depends on it, it must be represented through controlled project or environment requirements.

---

## Duplicate Source Of Truth Anti-Pattern

The same build configuration should not be independently defined in multiple locations.

For example:

```text id="u3mqly"
pyproject.toml
CI YAML
shell script
developer documentation
```

must not contain conflicting versions of the same rule.

---

## Build Input Contract

A build target SHOULD conceptually define an input contract.

A possible model is:

```text id="8p6shz"
BuildInputContract
│
├── Required Sources
├── Required Configuration
├── Required Dependencies
├── Required Tools
├── Required Environment
├── Optional Inputs
└── Validation Rules
```

The exact representation may remain documentation-based initially.

---

## Input Contract Benefits

An explicit contract improves:

* reproducibility;
* onboarding;
* diagnostics;
* automation;
* validation;
* build profile design.

---

## Development Input Profile

A development build may permit flexible state.

Possible characteristics include:

* uncommitted source;
* locally resolved dependencies;
* minimal metadata;
* faster validation.

However, core input requirements still apply.

---

## CI Input Profile

CI builds should typically operate from more controlled input state.

Examples include:

* known revision;
* explicit dependency installation;
* canonical configuration;
* validated runtime;
* controlled environment.

---

## Release Candidate Input Profile

Release-candidate inputs should generally be the strictest.

Possible requirements include:

```text id="9fv6i3"
Known Commit
Clean Working Tree
Locked Dependencies
Validated Configuration
Validated Toolchain
Controlled Build Profile
```

This provides stronger artifact trust.

---

## Plugin Input Requirements

Official plugin builds may require additional inputs such as:

* plugin metadata;
* capability definitions;
* plugin manifest;
* compliance configuration;
* templates;
* rules;
* policies.

These inputs must remain compatible with the Plugin Compliance Framework.

---

## Documentation Build Inputs

Documentation builds may consume:

* Markdown sources;
* manifests;
* schemas;
* API metadata;
* architecture references.

Documentation generation should not rely on uncontrolled local state.

---

## Input Security

Build inputs form part of the software supply chain.

Security considerations include:

* malicious dependencies;
* compromised generators;
* tampered metadata;
* untrusted external files;
* secret exposure.

Input validation should therefore cooperate with security architecture.

---

## Input Integrity

Where required, external or generated inputs may need integrity verification.

Possible mechanisms include:

* checksums;
* signatures;
* lock files;
* trusted package indexes;
* provenance metadata.

These controls can be introduced progressively.

---

## Input Observability

Build diagnostics should make relevant inputs visible.

A build report may eventually expose:

```text id="ckqkg0"
Source Revision
Build Profile
Dependency Set
Runtime Version
Toolchain Versions
Configuration Summary
```

Sensitive values must remain protected.

---

## Input Failure Classification

Input-related failures may be classified as:

```text id="krrdg3"
MISSING_INPUT
INVALID_INPUT
INCOMPATIBLE_INPUT
UNSUPPORTED_INPUT
UNTRUSTED_INPUT
STALE_GENERATED_INPUT
```

A formal implementation is optional, but the conceptual distinction improves diagnostics.

---

## Input Quality

High-quality build inputs are:

* explicit;
* valid;
* minimal;
* traceable;
* controlled;
* documented;
* compatible;
* reproducible.

Poor input quality inevitably reduces build quality.

---

## Input Governance

Significant changes to input requirements may require governance.

Examples include:

* new mandatory repository files;
* new dependency model;
* new toolchain requirement;
* new release-candidate requirement;
* new external input source;
* new secret requirement.

Architectural impact should determine governance level.

---

## Input Evolution

Build inputs will evolve as FamilyOS grows.

The framework must support:

* additional languages;
* new artifact formats;
* more plugins;
* generated components;
* stronger supply-chain controls.

New input categories should only be introduced when existing categories are insufficient.

---

## Input Requirements Summary

The canonical Build Input Requirements can be summarized as:

```text id="1dkszi"
Identify
   ↓
Declare
   ↓
Control
   ↓
Validate
   ↓
Resolve
   ↓
Trace
   ↓
Consume
```

Every significant input should move through this model.

---

## Mandatory Requirements

For a trusted build:

1. required inputs MUST exist;
2. significant inputs MUST be identifiable;
3. authoritative inputs SHOULD be version controlled;
4. dependency inputs MUST be declared;
5. required configuration MUST be explicit;
6. required toolchain state MUST be supported;
7. significant environment assumptions MUST be documented;
8. invalid inputs MUST prevent trusted artifact creation;
9. secrets MUST NOT be embedded unintentionally into artifacts;
10. generated inputs SHOULD have known origin;
11. release-candidate inputs SHOULD use stronger reproducibility controls;
12. significant input changes MUST remain governable.

---

## Build Input Success Criteria

The Build Input model is successful when FamilyOS can answer:

```text id="af13we"
Which inputs affected this build?

Where did they come from?

Were they valid?

Which dependencies were resolved?

Which configuration was active?

Which toolchain was used?

Which environment assumptions applied?

Were generated inputs current?

Were sensitive inputs protected?
```

If these questions cannot be answered for an important build, input control remains incomplete.

---

## Final Principle

The FamilyOS Build Input Requirements are founded on the following rule:

> Nothing that materially influences a trusted build should remain accidentally invisible.

Build reliability begins before execution.

It begins with identifying, controlling, validating, and understanding the engineering state that enters the build system.

A build can only be as trustworthy as the inputs from which it is produced.
