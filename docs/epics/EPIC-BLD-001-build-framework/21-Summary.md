# Build Framework

## 21 Summary

### Overview

EPIC-BLD-001 — Build Framework establishes the official FamilyOS engineering foundation for transforming controlled source state into validated, traceable, and trustworthy software artifacts.

The framework defines build engineering as more than the execution of a packaging command.

A FamilyOS build is a governed engineering process involving:

* controlled inputs;
* explicit configuration;
* managed dependencies;
* known toolchains;
* controlled environments;
* deterministic orchestration;
* predictable execution;
* explicit artifacts;
* artifact validation;
* build evidence;
* automation;
* governance;
* release handoff.

The central principle of the complete framework is:

> A successful command produces output. A trustworthy build produces validated artifacts whose origin, context, and integrity can be understood.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of EPIC-BLD-001 is to establish a coherent Build Framework for the FamilyOS Engineering Platform.

The framework provides the architecture required to answer:

* what constitutes a FamilyOS build;
* which inputs influence the build;
* how the build environment is controlled;
* how dependencies participate in the build;
* how build configuration is resolved;
* how build execution occurs;
* which outputs become artifacts;
* how artifacts are validated;
* how build evidence is produced;
* how CI executes canonical build semantics;
* how build decisions are governed;
* how trusted artifacts are handed to the Release Framework.

---

## Build Framework Position

The Build Framework occupies a specific position in the FamilyOS engineering lifecycle.

```text id="87w8lq"
Engineering State
      ↓
Testing / Quality / Compliance
      ↓
Build Framework
      ↓
Trusted Artifact + Evidence
      ↓
Release Framework
      ↓
Distribution
      ↓
Deployment
```

The Build Framework converts engineering state into trustworthy artifact state.

---

## Framework Boundary

EPIC-BLD-001 begins with controlled engineering inputs.

It ends when trusted artifacts and associated evidence are ready for downstream release processing.

The canonical boundary is:

```text id="qjld42"
Source + Configuration + Dependencies
              +
Toolchain + Environment + Policies
              ↓
        BUILD FRAMEWORK
              ↓
Trusted Artifact Set + Build Evidence
              ↓
        RELEASE FRAMEWORK
```

The Build Framework does not own official release approval or publication.

---

## Core Build Model

The complete Build Framework can be represented as:

```text id="x7ofeu"
Build Inputs
     ↓
Build Context
     ↓
Environment Preparation
     ↓
Dependency Resolution
     ↓
Toolchain Validation
     ↓
Pre-Build Validation
     ↓
Build Execution
     ↓
Candidate Artifacts
     ↓
Artifact Validation
     ↓
Build Evidence
     ↓
Trusted Artifact Set
     ↓
Release Handoff
```

This model is the architectural center of EPIC-BLD-001.

---

## Build Inputs

A build is influenced by more than source code.

The framework recognizes inputs such as:

```text id="vvtf3h"
Build Inputs
│
├── Source
├── Project Structure
├── Configuration
├── Dependencies
├── Toolchain
├── Environment
├── Build Profile
├── Policies
└── Relevant Metadata
```

Trustworthy builds require these influences to be sufficiently explicit and controlled.

---

## Build Context

The Build Context represents the effective state under which a particular build executes.

Conceptually:

```text id="vpg0gv"
Build Context =
    Source State
  + Effective Configuration
  + Dependency State
  + Toolchain State
  + Environment State
  + Build Profile
  + Applicable Policies
```

The Build Context provides the basis for reproducibility and traceability.

---

## Build Identity

Significant builds should progressively receive a Build ID or equivalent identity.

A Build ID allows FamilyOS to associate:

```text id="vwt5d6"
Build ID
│
├── Source Revision
├── Build Context
├── Execution
├── Artifact Set
├── Validation
└── Evidence
```

Build identity becomes increasingly important as automation and release maturity increase.

---

## Build Principles

The Build Framework establishes durable principles.

---

### Principle 1 — Explicit Inputs

Build behavior should depend on explicit and governed inputs.

---

### Principle 2 — Reproducibility

Equivalent build contexts should produce equivalent meaningful results.

---

### Principle 3 — Deterministic Configuration

Configuration precedence and profile resolution must be understandable.

---

### Principle 4 — Environment Control

Environment state must not silently determine important build behavior.

---

### Principle 5 — Dependency Control

Dependencies must be declared, governed, and sufficiently reproducible for the build profile.

---

### Principle 6 — Toolchain Control

Critical build tools must be identifiable and validated.

---

### Principle 7 — Predictable Execution

Build execution should follow a canonical, understandable sequence.

---

### Principle 8 — Explicit Artifacts

Trusted artifacts must be deliberately identified.

---

### Principle 9 — Validation Before Trust

Generated output does not become trusted merely because the build command completed successfully.

---

### Principle 10 — Evidence

Important builds should produce enough evidence to explain what happened.

---

### Principle 11 — Automation Reuses Architecture

CI must execute canonical Build Framework semantics rather than invent separate behavior.

---

### Principle 12 — Build And Release Separation

Build success must not automatically imply release authorization.

---

## Build Architecture

The Build Architecture separates responsibilities into understandable layers.

A conceptual architecture is:

```text id="hd07mp"
Build Interface
      ↓
Context Resolution
      ↓
Validation
      ↓
Orchestration
      ↓
Build Backend / Toolchain
      ↓
Artifact Collection
      ↓
Artifact Validation
      ↓
Evidence
      ↓
Release Handoff
```

This separation allows implementation tools to evolve without redefining Build Framework semantics.

---

## Build Lifecycle

The Build Lifecycle extends beyond command execution.

The framework defines a lifecycle such as:

```text id="bcop2d"
Design
  ↓
Prepare
  ↓
Resolve
  ↓
Validate
  ↓
Execute
  ↓
Identify Artifacts
  ↓
Validate Artifacts
  ↓
Generate Evidence
  ↓
Finalize
  ↓
Handoff
  ↓
Maintain
  ↓
Improve
```

This makes build engineering a continuous platform capability.

---

## Build Input Requirements

Build inputs must be:

* identifiable;
* relevant;
* sufficiently explicit;
* validated where appropriate;
* governed according to their impact.

Hidden build inputs reduce reproducibility.

---

## Project Structure

Repository structure forms part of the build contract.

The framework therefore connects project structure with:

* source discovery;
* package discovery;
* metadata;
* generated resources;
* documentation;
* tests;
* artifact creation.

Build behavior should not depend on accidental filesystem layout.

---

## Build Toolchain

The Build Toolchain provides the tools required to execute and validate builds.

Current or potential toolchain components may include:

* Python;
* packaging frontends;
* packaging backends;
* Ruff;
* MyPy;
* Pytest;
* Git;
* CI tooling.

The framework deliberately separates tool identity from architectural responsibility.

---

## Toolchain Principle

The rule is:

```text id="yyn2sh"
Architecture
    ↓
Tool Responsibility
    ↓
Selected Tool
```

not:

```text id="rwm46u"
Selected Tool
    ↓
Architecture
```

This protects FamilyOS from unnecessary tool lock-in.

---

## Build Environment

The Build Environment includes runtime and system conditions that can influence execution.

Relevant properties may include:

* operating system;
* runtime version;
* architecture;
* environment variables;
* installed tools;
* filesystem state;
* locale;
* timezone.

Not every property requires immediate normalization.

Properties that materially affect build results should be controlled.

---

## Environment Reproducibility

The target is not necessarily identical physical machines.

The target is equivalent controlled build semantics.

```text id="uxusot"
Environment A
      ↓
Controlled Requirements
      ↓
Equivalent Build Semantics
      ↑
Environment B
```

---

## Dependency Management

Dependencies are first-class build inputs.

The framework governs:

* declaration;
* constraints;
* resolution;
* locking;
* compatibility;
* updates;
* security;
* traceability.

---

## Dependency Reproducibility

Higher-trust build profiles require stronger dependency determinism.

The framework therefore allows dependency controls to increase with build purpose.

---

## Build Configuration

Build Configuration determines how canonical build behavior is parameterized.

The framework requires:

* explicit configuration sources;
* deterministic precedence;
* validated values;
* clear profile selection;
* secret separation;
* effective configuration visibility where appropriate.

---

## Build Profiles

Different build purposes may use different profiles.

Examples include:

```text id="rvzn8f"
development
validation
ci
documentation
plugin
release-candidate
```

Profiles may change strictness.

They must not silently create incompatible build architectures.

---

## Build Philosophy

The Build Framework distinguishes execution success from build trust.

The fundamental progression is:

```text id="66jv4e"
Execution
   ↓
Output
   ↓
Validation
   ↓
Evidence
   ↓
Trust
```

This distinction is essential to the entire framework.

---

## Build Execution

Build Execution performs the controlled transformation of validated Build Context into candidate artifacts.

Execution should be:

* predictable;
* observable;
* fail-fast where appropriate;
* isolated from release authority;
* consistent across local and automated environments.

---

## Execution Result

The result of Build Execution is not automatically a trusted release artifact.

It is initially:

```text id="5fjik5"
Candidate Artifact
```

Trust requires validation.

---

## Artifact Management

Artifacts are explicit engineering objects.

The framework distinguishes:

```text id="2e5qkn"
Raw Output
    ↓
Candidate Artifact
    ↓
Validated Artifact
    ↓
Trusted Artifact
```

This prevents accidental promotion of unverified output.

---

## Artifact Identity

An artifact should progressively be associated with:

* name;
* type;
* version context;
* source revision;
* Build ID;
* integrity information;
* validation state.

---

## Artifact Integrity

Cryptographic digests may be used to establish artifact content identity.

Once a trusted artifact changes, previous validation no longer applies.

```text id="c70z0l"
Trusted Artifact
      +
Byte Modification
      ↓
New Artifact Identity
      ↓
Validation Required
```

---

## Artifact Manifest

A mature build may produce an artifact manifest containing:

```text id="zhve31"
Artifact Manifest
│
├── Artifact Name
├── Artifact Type
├── Path
├── Size
├── Digest
└── Validation Status
```

This supports downstream automation and release handoff.

---

## Build Validation

Build Validation determines whether a candidate artifact satisfies applicable requirements.

Validation may include:

* input validation;
* environment validation;
* toolchain validation;
* source validation;
* testing;
* artifact structure;
* metadata;
* clean installation;
* smoke validation;
* integrity verification.

---

## Artifact-Level Validation

One of the most important framework rules is:

> FamilyOS must validate the artifact that will actually be consumed, not only the source from which it was generated.

This reduces packaging-specific defects.

---

## Clean Installation

A strong validation pattern is:

```text id="i54j3i"
Candidate Artifact
      ↓
Fresh Environment
      ↓
Install
      ↓
Smoke Validate
      ↓
Trusted Artifact
```

---

## Build Evidence

Build Evidence explains why a build result can be trusted.

Evidence may include:

```text id="f6c6df"
Source Revision
Build ID
Effective Configuration
Runtime Version
Toolchain Versions
Dependency State
Validation Results
Artifact Manifest
Checksums
```

Evidence requirements should remain proportional to build purpose.

---

## Build Automation

Automation exists to execute the Build Framework consistently.

The architecture is:

```text id="ykb0lv"
Build Framework
      ↓
Canonical Build Interface
      ↓
Automation Adapter
      ↓
CI Environment
```

CI does not own Build Architecture.

---

## Continuous Integration

CI provides independent execution from a controlled repository revision.

A canonical CI progression is:

```text id="ycb9ql"
Checkout
   ↓
Provision Environment
   ↓
Install Dependencies
   ↓
Validate
   ↓
Test
   ↓
Build
   ↓
Validate Artifacts
   ↓
Collect Evidence
```

---

## Local And CI Consistency

FamilyOS should progressively ensure that local and CI environments invoke the same canonical build semantics.

A developer should be able to reproduce most CI failures through known local commands.

---

## Build Automation Security

Automation must apply:

* least privilege;
* secret isolation;
* controlled dependencies;
* explicit permissions;
* artifact integrity;
* separation of build and release authority.

---

## Build Governance

Build Governance ensures that Build Framework evolution remains controlled.

Governance defines:

* ownership;
* decision authority;
* review expectations;
* architecture decisions;
* RFC relationships;
* exceptions;
* technical debt;
* risk management;
* lifecycle changes.

---

## Governance Proportionality

Not every build change requires formal architectural governance.

The framework distinguishes between:

```text id="kcd8qg"
Routine Change
Significant Build Change
Architectural Change
```

Governance should match impact.

---

## Build Technical Debt

Build infrastructure is production engineering infrastructure.

Build debt therefore includes:

* duplicated build paths;
* hidden configuration;
* undocumented dependencies;
* CI-only semantics;
* obsolete tooling;
* unstable automation;
* excessive permissions;
* non-reproducible behavior.

Such debt must be managed deliberately.

---

## Build And Testing

EPIC-BLD-001 integrates with EPIC-TST-001.

The boundary is:

```text id="h2dggk"
Build Framework
      ↓
Request Applicable Tests
      ↓
Testing Framework
      ↓
Test Evidence
      ↓
Build Validation
```

Testing semantics remain owned by the Testing Framework.

---

## Build And Quality

EPIC-BLD-001 integrates with EPIC-QLT-001.

```text id="5hn4qi"
Build Evidence
      ↓
Quality Framework
      ↓
Quality Evaluation / Gate
```

The Build Framework provides evidence.

The Quality Framework defines quality policy.

---

## Build And Documentation

EPIC-BLD-001 integrates with EPIC-DOC-001.

Documentation may be:

* an input;
* generated during build;
* validated;
* packaged as an artifact.

Documentation governance remains owned by the Documentation Framework.

---

## Build And Plugin Compliance

Official plugin builds may integrate EPIC-PLUGIN-002.

```text id="uxrt07"
Plugin Source
      ↓
Compliance Validation
      ↓
Build
      ↓
Artifact Validation
      ↓
Trusted Plugin Artifact
```

Compliance semantics remain owned by the Plugin Compliance Framework.

---

## Build And Release

The Build/Release boundary is one of the most important FamilyOS engineering boundaries.

The Build Framework produces:

```text id="glsg8n"
Trusted Artifact Set
        +
Build Evidence
```

The Release Framework decides:

```text id="ifus8f"
Version
Approval
Promotion
Publication
Distribution
```

---

## Build Once, Promote

The long-term preferred model is:

```text id="k3vbg8"
Source
  ↓
Build Once
  ↓
Validate
  ↓
Trusted Artifact
  ↓
Release Approval
  ↓
Promote Same Bytes
```

This provides stronger traceability than rebuilding during release.

---

## Release Candidate Profile

A release-candidate build may apply stronger controls such as:

* clean source state;
* controlled runtime;
* locked dependencies;
* full validation;
* artifact integrity;
* stronger evidence.

It still does not authorize release by itself.

---

## Build Roadmap

EPIC-BLD-001 defines an incremental maturity path.

```text id="gcyw61"
Phase 1
Build Foundation

    ↓

Phase 2
Build Standardization

    ↓

Phase 3
Build Validation

    ↓

Phase 4
Build Automation

    ↓

Phase 5
Artifact Trust

    ↓

Phase 6
Reproducibility and Traceability

    ↓

Phase 7
Release Integration

    ↓

Phase 8
Supply Chain Assurance
```

This roadmap prevents premature infrastructure complexity.

---

## Immediate Priorities

The highest-value implementation sequence is:

```text id="8fh1yi"
Canonical Build Interface
        ↓
Environment Standardization
        ↓
Dependency Standardization
        ↓
Artifact Standardization
        ↓
Artifact Validation
        ↓
CI Automation
        ↓
Build Identity
        ↓
Evidence
        ↓
Reproducibility
        ↓
Release Integration
```

---

## Future Build Maturity

Future FamilyOS maturity may introduce:

* stronger dependency locking;
* declarative build environments;
* artifact manifests;
* Build Context fingerprints;
* reproducibility comparison;
* SBOM generation;
* provenance attestations;
* artifact signing;
* trusted builders.

These capabilities should only be introduced when engineering or security needs justify them.

---

## Supply Chain Direction

The long-term build model may evolve toward:

```text id="rc10as"
Controlled Source
      ↓
Controlled Builder
      ↓
Reproducible Build Context
      ↓
Validated Artifact
      ↓
Integrity
      ↓
Provenance
      ↓
Authorized Release
```

EPIC-BLD-001 provides the architectural foundation required for that evolution.

---

## Build Framework Validation

The framework itself must be validated before closure.

Framework validation covers:

* structure;
* content;
* architecture;
* terminology;
* boundaries;
* cross-framework integration;
* control documents;
* implementation readiness.

The existence of all files alone is insufficient.

---

## Canonical Document Set

The final normative EPIC-BLD-001 structure is:

```text id="85ddqa"
00-EPIC.md
01-Context.md
02-Vision.md
03-Build-Principles.md
04-Build-Architecture.md
05-Build-Lifecycle.md
06-Build-Input-Requirements.md
07-Build-Inputs-and-Project-Structure.md
08-Build-Toolchain.md
09-Build-Environment-Management.md
10-Dependency-Management.md
11-Build-Configuration.md
12-Build-Philosophy.md
13-Build-Execution.md
14-Artifact-Management.md
15-Build-Validation.md
16-Build-Governance.md
17-Build-Automation-and-CI.md
18-Roadmap.md
19-References.md
20-Validation.md
21-Summary.md
22-Release.md
23-Implementation-Checklist.md
```

---

## Control Documents

The framework is supported by:

```text id="fj1np3"
EPIC-BLD-001.md
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

These documents provide framework identity, navigation, history, manifest control, validation state, and lifecycle governance.

---

## Framework Completion Model

EPIC-BLD-001 should be considered complete when:

```text id="ufb9ej"
Architecture Complete
        +
Documentation Complete
        +
Structural Validation
        +
Cross-Framework Validation
        +
Control Documents Synchronized
        +
Implementation Checklist Complete
        ↓
Framework Validated
```

---

## Build Framework Invariants

The complete framework establishes several invariants.

### Invariant 1

Build inputs must be sufficiently explicit to understand meaningful build behavior.

### Invariant 2

Configuration resolution must be deterministic.

### Invariant 3

Dependencies must be governed.

### Invariant 4

Toolchain requirements must be identifiable.

### Invariant 5

Environment requirements must be controlled according to build purpose.

### Invariant 6

Build execution must produce explicitly identifiable candidate artifacts.

### Invariant 7

Candidate artifacts must be validated before becoming trusted artifacts.

### Invariant 8

Trusted artifacts must have traceable origin.

### Invariant 9

Automation must execute canonical Build Framework semantics.

### Invariant 10

CI-specific infrastructure must not become hidden Build Architecture.

### Invariant 11

Build success must remain distinct from release approval.

### Invariant 12

Downstream release should prefer promotion of the exact validated artifact.

### Invariant 13

Build governance must remain proportional to engineering impact.

### Invariant 14

Future supply-chain controls must extend the architecture rather than replace it.

---

## What EPIC-BLD-001 Establishes

The framework establishes that FamilyOS build engineering is:

```text id="3k5x5a"
Explicit
Controlled
Repeatable
Validatable
Traceable
Automatable
Governed
Release-Aware
Security-Aware
Evolvable
```

---

## What EPIC-BLD-001 Does Not Establish

The framework does not require FamilyOS to immediately implement:

* custom build infrastructure;
* distributed builds;
* remote execution;
* mandatory containerization;
* dedicated artifact registries;
* artifact signing;
* SBOM infrastructure;
* provenance services.

These remain possible maturity extensions.

---

## Implementation Direction

The next stage after framework completion is controlled implementation.

Implementation should begin with the simplest capabilities that realize the architecture.

The preferred progression is:

```text id="ojgzsv"
Framework
   ↓
Canonical Build Interface
   ↓
Build Validation
   ↓
Artifact Validation
   ↓
CI Integration
   ↓
Evidence
   ↓
Release Integration
```

---

## Engineering Outcome

When implemented, the Build Framework should allow a FamilyOS engineer to answer:

1. what source state is being built;
2. what configuration applies;
3. which dependencies are involved;
4. which toolchain is used;
5. which environment requirements apply;
6. which build profile is active;
7. what command or interface executes the build;
8. what artifacts were generated;
9. whether those artifacts were validated;
10. what evidence supports the build;
11. whether CI used the same semantics;
12. whether the artifact is suitable for release handoff.

---

## Strategic Outcome

The strategic result of EPIC-BLD-001 is a reliable boundary between engineering development and software release.

Before the Build Framework:

```text id="dmj7zf"
Source
  ↓
Commands
  ↓
Files
```

With the Build Framework:

```text id="ej1c3q"
Controlled Engineering State
          ↓
Canonical Build Process
          ↓
Validated Artifact Set
          ↓
Build Evidence
          ↓
Trusted Release Handoff
```

This is a fundamental maturity step for the FamilyOS Engineering Platform.

---

## Framework Relationship Summary

The complete relationship is:

```text id="c60e62"
EPIC-ENG-001
Engineering Foundation
        ↓
EPIC-TST-001
Testing Framework
        ↓
EPIC-QLT-001
Quality Framework
        ↓
EPIC-DOC-001
Documentation Framework
        ↓
EPIC-PLUGIN-002
Plugin Compliance Framework
        ↓
EPIC-BLD-001
Build Framework
        ↓
EPIC-REL-001
Release Framework
```

Each framework retains its own responsibility while contributing to a coherent engineering lifecycle.

---

## Final Build Model

The complete FamilyOS Build Framework can ultimately be summarized as:

```text id="4y3p4v"
Controlled Inputs
      ↓
Controlled Build Context
      ↓
Canonical Execution
      ↓
Candidate Artifacts
      ↓
Validation
      ↓
Integrity
      ↓
Evidence
      ↓
Trusted Artifacts
      ↓
Release Handoff
```

---

## Final Principle

EPIC-BLD-001 is founded on one final rule:

> FamilyOS does not trust software because a build command succeeded. FamilyOS trusts an artifact when the process that produced it is controlled, the artifact itself has been validated, and sufficient evidence exists to understand its origin.

The Build Framework transforms build engineering from an implicit collection of commands into an explicit FamilyOS platform capability.

It establishes the architectural foundation required for repeatable development builds, reliable CI execution, validated packaging, artifact traceability, release integration, and future software supply-chain assurance.

EPIC-BLD-001 therefore defines the bridge between **FamilyOS engineering state** and **FamilyOS releasable software artifacts**.
