# Build Framework

## 00 EPIC

### EPIC-BLD-001 — Build Framework

### Overview

EPIC-BLD-001 — Build Framework establishes the official build engineering foundation for the FamilyOS ecosystem.

The purpose of this framework is to define how FamilyOS source code, configuration, dependencies, generated resources, and other controlled inputs are transformed into trusted, reproducible, traceable, and verifiable build artifacts.

The Build Framework treats build engineering as a first-class platform capability rather than as a collection of isolated commands or packaging scripts.

A FamilyOS build must provide more than successful execution.

It must establish confidence that the produced artifact:

* originates from known and controlled inputs;
* was produced using an explicitly defined build environment;
* uses governed dependencies and tooling;
* follows deterministic and repeatable build processes;
* can be independently validated;
* contains sufficient metadata for traceability;
* can be associated with evidence describing how it was produced;
* satisfies applicable engineering and quality requirements;
* is suitable for subsequent release processing.

The Build Framework therefore forms the controlled transformation boundary between FamilyOS engineering activities and FamilyOS release activities.

---

## Mission

The mission of EPIC-BLD-001 is to establish a unified, reliable, reproducible, secure, observable, and governable build model for the complete FamilyOS engineering ecosystem.

The framework defines the principles, architecture, lifecycle, processes, validation mechanisms, artifact model, automation model, and governance responsibilities required to transform FamilyOS engineering inputs into trusted technical outputs.

Its central objective is to guarantee that build artifacts are not merely generated, but are generated under controlled and explainable conditions.

The framework establishes the following fundamental transformation:

```text
Controlled Engineering Inputs
            ↓
    Defined Build Context
            ↓
      Build Execution
            ↓
      Build Validation
            ↓
     Trusted Artifacts
            ↓
      Release Framework
```

Build engineering therefore becomes an explicit assurance capability within FamilyOS.

---

## Context

FamilyOS is evolving from a conventional software project into a modular engineering platform composed of multiple architectural layers, frameworks, plugins, specifications, automation systems, domain capabilities, and governance mechanisms.

As this ecosystem grows, build operations become increasingly significant.

Without a formal Build Framework, different parts of the platform could gradually introduce:

* inconsistent build commands;
* uncontrolled environment assumptions;
* divergent dependency resolution;
* undocumented build configuration;
* non-reproducible artifacts;
* inconsistent packaging behavior;
* insufficient artifact metadata;
* weak traceability between source and artifacts;
* undocumented generated resources;
* manual build procedures;
* inconsistent validation;
* hidden toolchain dependencies;
* release processes dependent on locally produced artifacts.

These conditions would progressively reduce confidence in the FamilyOS engineering platform.

A build process must therefore be governed with the same architectural discipline applied to source code, testing, quality, documentation, plugins, releases, and other platform foundations.

---

## Strategic Position

The Build Framework occupies a precise position within the FamilyOS Engineering Platform.

```text
Engineering Foundation
        ↓
Testing Framework
        ↓
Quality Framework
        ↓
Build Framework
        ↓
Release Framework
```

Each framework addresses a different engineering responsibility.

The Engineering Foundation defines how FamilyOS engineering work is structured and governed.

The Testing Framework defines how implementation behavior is verified.

The Quality Framework defines how engineering quality is measured, controlled, evidenced, and improved.

The Build Framework defines how approved engineering inputs are transformed into controlled artifacts.

The Release Framework defines how validated artifacts are versioned, promoted, published, distributed, and communicated.

These responsibilities are complementary but intentionally separated.

---

## Build Framework Responsibility

The Build Framework owns the transformation from build inputs to build outputs.

This includes:

* build principles;
* build architecture;
* build lifecycle;
* build input requirements;
* build environment management;
* dependency management;
* build configuration;
* build toolchain governance;
* build execution;
* artifact creation;
* artifact identification;
* artifact metadata;
* artifact traceability;
* build validation;
* build automation;
* CI integration;
* build governance;
* build evidence;
* build reproducibility;
* build observability;
* readiness for release.

The framework does not replace testing, quality management, release management, deployment management, or runtime operations.

Instead, it consumes requirements and evidence from those engineering capabilities and exposes trusted outputs to downstream systems.

---

## Build Philosophy

FamilyOS adopts the following fundamental principle:

> A successful build is not sufficient evidence of a trustworthy artifact.

An artifact is trustworthy only when the process that produced it is controlled, repeatable, traceable, validated, and explainable.

The Build Framework therefore distinguishes between:

```text
Build Success
```

and:

```text
Build Trust
```

Build success means that an execution completed without fatal failure.

Build trust means that sufficient evidence exists to demonstrate that the resulting artifact was produced according to FamilyOS build requirements.

This distinction is foundational.

---

## Build Trust Model

The FamilyOS build trust model is based on several complementary assurance dimensions.

```text
                         Build Trust
                              │
        ┌─────────────────────┼─────────────────────┐
        │                     │                     │
 Reproducibility         Traceability          Validation
        │                     │                     │
        ├───────────────┬─────┴─────┬───────────────┤
        │               │           │               │
 Environment        Dependencies   Metadata      Evidence
        │               │           │               │
        └───────────────┴─────┬─────┴───────────────┘
                              │
                         Governance
```

No single dimension is sufficient on its own.

Trust emerges from the combination of controlled inputs, controlled execution, validation, evidence, and governance.

---

## Objectives

EPIC-BLD-001 establishes the following primary objectives.

### Reproducibility

Build processes SHOULD produce equivalent outputs when executed from equivalent controlled inputs under equivalent build conditions.

Environmental variability must be minimized, controlled, or explicitly documented.

Reproducibility enables:

* reliable debugging;
* artifact verification;
* operational confidence;
* consistent CI behavior;
* release confidence;
* long-term maintainability.

---

### Determinism

Build behavior SHOULD be deterministic wherever technically feasible.

Hidden variables such as:

* uncontrolled timestamps;
* host-specific state;
* implicit environment variables;
* network-dependent resolution;
* mutable dependencies;
* undeclared tools;
* local machine configuration;

must not silently determine build output.

When strict determinism cannot be achieved, the source of variability MUST be explicit and governed.

---

### Traceability

Every trusted build artifact SHOULD be traceable to the inputs and process that produced it.

Traceability may include:

* source revision;
* repository state;
* dependency versions;
* toolchain versions;
* build configuration;
* build profile;
* build identifier;
* execution environment;
* validation results;
* associated evidence.

The objective is to make the origin of an artifact technically explainable.

---

### Reliability

Build processes must behave consistently across supported execution environments.

Reliability includes:

* predictable build commands;
* explicit failure conditions;
* stable dependency resolution;
* validated configuration;
* controlled tooling;
* repeatable execution;
* actionable failure information.

---

### Automation

Build processes SHOULD be automation-friendly and MUST avoid unnecessary dependence on manual intervention.

Automation must preserve engineering controls rather than bypass them.

FamilyOS build automation may operate in:

* local engineering workflows;
* validation pipelines;
* continuous integration;
* artifact generation pipelines;
* release preparation pipelines.

---

### Validation

Build output must be validated before it is considered trusted.

Validation may include:

* configuration validation;
* source readiness validation;
* dependency validation;
* toolchain validation;
* artifact integrity validation;
* metadata validation;
* packaging validation;
* structural validation;
* policy validation;
* integration with quality gates.

---

### Security

Build engineering must minimize the risk of uncontrolled or malicious influence over build outputs.

The framework must support controls related to:

* dependency integrity;
* toolchain integrity;
* build isolation;
* controlled configuration;
* artifact integrity;
* provenance;
* secret handling;
* unauthorized modification;
* execution boundaries.

Security requirements remain aligned with the broader FamilyOS Security Architecture and related governance mechanisms.

---

### Observability

Build operations must produce sufficient information to understand:

* what was executed;
* which inputs were used;
* what configuration was active;
* which stages succeeded or failed;
* what artifacts were produced;
* which validations were performed;
* why a build failed;
* whether the resulting artifacts are trustworthy.

Observability is essential for both engineering efficiency and governance.

---

### Governance

Build rules must evolve under controlled engineering governance.

Significant changes to:

* build architecture;
* build lifecycle;
* build artifact contracts;
* supported build systems;
* dependency resolution;
* automation strategy;
* provenance requirements;
* validation requirements;

may require formal review through the appropriate FamilyOS governance mechanisms.

---

## Scope

EPIC-BLD-001 governs the official FamilyOS build model.

Its scope includes the following domains.

---

### Build Principles

The framework defines the engineering principles governing FamilyOS builds.

These principles include:

* reproducibility;
* determinism;
* explicitness;
* traceability;
* automation;
* validation;
* isolation;
* transparency;
* maintainability;
* controlled evolution.

---

### Build Architecture

The framework defines the conceptual architecture through which build inputs are transformed into artifacts.

The build architecture defines responsibilities between:

* source inputs;
* generated inputs;
* configuration;
* dependencies;
* build environment;
* build engine;
* validation systems;
* metadata generation;
* artifact production;
* automation systems;
* downstream release processes.

---

### Build Lifecycle

The framework defines the lifecycle of a build capability from design through execution, validation, maintenance, and improvement.

The lifecycle provides a common model for understanding build engineering work across the repository.

---

### Build Inputs

Build inputs include all controlled information capable of influencing a build.

Examples include:

* source code;
* project metadata;
* configuration;
* dependency declarations;
* lock files;
* generated sources;
* templates;
* schemas;
* resources;
* packaging definitions;
* toolchain configuration.

Build inputs must be explicit whenever technically feasible.

---

### Build Environments

The framework defines expectations for build environments.

This includes:

* environment consistency;
* environment isolation;
* supported runtime versions;
* build dependencies;
* environment configuration;
* reproducibility;
* environment validation;
* CI execution compatibility.

---

### Dependency Management

The Build Framework defines build-specific dependency expectations.

This includes:

* dependency declaration;
* version constraints;
* lock mechanisms;
* resolution behavior;
* dependency provenance;
* dependency validation;
* dependency updates;
* dependency reproducibility.

Dependency policy may also interact with Security and Quality requirements.

---

### Build Configuration

Build configuration must be explicit, inspectable, controlled, and version-aware.

The framework defines requirements for:

* configuration structure;
* build profiles;
* default behavior;
* environment overrides;
* validation;
* configuration ownership;
* configuration evolution.

---

### Build Toolchain

The framework defines how build tools are selected, versioned, integrated, maintained, and governed.

The toolchain may include:

* language tooling;
* package builders;
* dependency managers;
* code generators;
* validation tools;
* packaging tools;
* automation tools;
* CI execution tools.

Tool choice must remain subordinate to architectural requirements.

---

### Build Execution

The framework defines the execution model by which a build progresses from validated inputs to candidate artifacts.

Execution requirements include:

* explicit entry points;
* defined stages;
* deterministic ordering;
* failure propagation;
* evidence production;
* automation compatibility.

---

### Artifact Management

The Build Framework defines the technical model for artifacts produced by FamilyOS builds.

Artifact management includes:

* artifact creation;
* artifact identity;
* artifact naming;
* artifact metadata;
* artifact integrity;
* artifact traceability;
* artifact validation;
* artifact storage expectations;
* artifact handoff.

---

### Build Validation

The framework defines how a build and its outputs are validated.

Validation may operate before, during, and after build execution.

Validation results form part of the evidence required to establish build trust.

---

### Build Automation and CI

The framework defines how build capabilities integrate with automated engineering workflows.

Automation must provide consistency between:

```text
Developer Build
      ↓
CI Build
      ↓
Validated Build
      ↓
Release Candidate Artifact
```

The same conceptual build rules must apply regardless of execution context.

---

### Build Governance

The framework establishes responsibilities for maintaining and evolving the build model.

Governance addresses:

* ownership;
* architectural decisions;
* standards;
* change review;
* framework compliance;
* exceptions;
* technical debt;
* lifecycle management.

---

## Out of Scope

EPIC-BLD-001 intentionally does not define the complete behavior of adjacent engineering frameworks.

The following areas remain outside its primary ownership.

### Software Testing

The Build Framework may execute or require tests, but testing strategy, testing levels, fixtures, coverage, test architecture, and broader testing policy belong to EPIC-TST-001.

---

### Quality Governance

The Build Framework consumes applicable quality requirements and may participate in quality gates.

The definition of the global FamilyOS quality model belongs to EPIC-QLT-001.

---

### Release Management

The Build Framework produces artifacts suitable for release.

Version promotion, publication, release approval, distribution, release notes, and release lifecycle governance belong to EPIC-REL-001.

---

### Deployment

Deployment transforms released software into operational runtime environments.

Deployment architecture is governed separately from build engineering.

---

### Runtime Operations

Application runtime behavior, runtime orchestration, runtime observability, operational resilience, and production incident management are not defined by this framework.

---

## Build Boundary

A clear boundary must exist between build and release responsibilities.

The Build Framework answers:

```text
Can FamilyOS produce a trusted artifact from these inputs?
```

The Release Framework answers:

```text
Should this trusted artifact become an official FamilyOS release?
```

This distinction prevents build completion from automatically implying release authorization.

---

## Canonical Build Flow

The canonical FamilyOS build flow is:

```text
Source Revision
      ↓
Input Discovery
      ↓
Input Validation
      ↓
Configuration Resolution
      ↓
Dependency Resolution
      ↓
Environment Validation
      ↓
Build Preparation
      ↓
Build Execution
      ↓
Artifact Generation
      ↓
Artifact Metadata Generation
      ↓
Build Validation
      ↓
Evidence Generation
      ↓
Trusted Build Artifact
      ↓
Release Framework
```

Individual implementations may optimize or combine internal steps, but the conceptual responsibilities must remain identifiable.

---

## Build Inputs Model

The build system must treat every significant input as part of the effective build context.

A conceptual build context may be represented as:

```text
Build Context
│
├── Source Revision
├── Repository State
├── Build Configuration
├── Dependency Graph
├── Toolchain
├── Runtime Version
├── Build Environment
├── Generated Inputs
├── Build Profile
└── Applicable Policies
```

Changes to any significant member of this context may influence the resulting artifact.

Therefore, sufficient contextual information must be captured for trusted builds.

---

## Build Artifact Model

A FamilyOS artifact is not merely a file.

An artifact is a technical output associated with sufficient identity and evidence to describe its origin.

Conceptually:

```text
Artifact
│
├── Identity
├── Type
├── Version Context
├── Source Revision
├── Build Identifier
├── Build Profile
├── Toolchain Context
├── Dependency Context
├── Integrity Information
├── Validation Status
└── Evidence References
```

The exact metadata representation may vary according to artifact type.

---

## Artifact Classes

FamilyOS builds may generate multiple artifact classes.

Examples include:

* Python packages;
* distributions;
* wheels;
* source distributions;
* generated documentation;
* generated schemas;
* generated configuration;
* templates;
* plugin packages;
* metadata bundles;
* manifests;
* validation reports;
* provenance records;
* release candidate bundles.

The Build Framework defines common expectations without requiring every artifact type to use an identical physical representation.

---

## Build Evidence

Build evidence provides information demonstrating how an artifact was produced and validated.

Evidence may include:

* build identifier;
* source commit;
* dependency state;
* environment information;
* tool versions;
* execution logs;
* validation results;
* checksums;
* artifact manifests;
* provenance metadata;
* policy results.

Evidence must be sufficient for the level of trust required by the artifact.

---

## Reproducibility Model

FamilyOS distinguishes several levels of reproducibility.

### Process Reproducibility

The same build process can be executed again using the same documented procedure.

### Environment Reproducibility

The required build environment can be reconstructed from controlled definitions.

### Dependency Reproducibility

Equivalent dependency resolution can be obtained from controlled dependency declarations and locking mechanisms.

### Artifact Reproducibility

Equivalent controlled inputs produce equivalent artifacts, subject to explicitly documented non-deterministic elements.

The framework SHOULD progressively increase reproducibility across these levels.

---

## Build Profiles

FamilyOS may support multiple build profiles.

Examples include:

```text
development
validation
ci
release-candidate
documentation
plugin
```

Profiles must not introduce hidden engineering behavior.

Each profile should define:

* purpose;
* expected inputs;
* active configuration;
* validations;
* artifact expectations;
* permitted environment assumptions.

---

## Local and CI Consistency

A critical objective of the framework is to reduce divergence between developer and automated builds.

The following anti-pattern must be avoided:

```text
Local Build ≠ CI Build
```

The target model is:

```text
Shared Build Definition
        │
        ├── Local Execution
        ├── CI Execution
        └── Release Preparation
```

Execution environments may differ, but the underlying build semantics must remain consistent.

---

## Validation Model

Build validation follows the principle:

```text
Validate Inputs
      ↓
Validate Execution
      ↓
Validate Outputs
      ↓
Establish Evidence
      ↓
Trust Artifact
```

A build artifact must not become trusted solely because the build command returned a successful exit code.

---

## Failure Model

Build failures must be explicit and actionable.

Failures may include:

* invalid configuration;
* missing input;
* unresolved dependency;
* unsupported environment;
* toolchain mismatch;
* generation failure;
* packaging failure;
* validation failure;
* artifact integrity failure;
* policy violation.

Where possible, failures should identify:

* failing stage;
* relevant input;
* failure reason;
* diagnostic evidence;
* recommended corrective direction.

---

## Build Quality Gates

The Build Framework integrates with FamilyOS quality gates without duplicating the Quality Framework.

Possible build-related gates include:

```text
Input Gate
    ↓
Configuration Gate
    ↓
Dependency Gate
    ↓
Execution Gate
    ↓
Artifact Gate
    ↓
Validation Gate
    ↓
Release Readiness Gate
```

The exact implementation of gates may evolve as FamilyOS automation matures.

---

## Build Security Principles

The build process is part of the software supply chain and must therefore be treated as a security-sensitive engineering capability.

The framework promotes:

* explicit dependencies;
* controlled tooling;
* integrity validation;
* minimal privilege;
* isolation where appropriate;
* controlled secret exposure;
* artifact integrity;
* provenance;
* auditable automation.

Security controls must remain proportional to FamilyOS architecture and risk.

---

## Supply Chain Awareness

The FamilyOS build process exists within a broader software supply chain.

Conceptually:

```text
Source
  ↓
Dependencies
  ↓
Toolchain
  ↓
Build Environment
  ↓
Build Process
  ↓
Artifacts
  ↓
Release
  ↓
Distribution
```

Weakness at any stage may reduce confidence in downstream outputs.

The Build Framework therefore establishes the foundation required for future strengthening of FamilyOS software supply-chain controls.

---

## Build Observability

Build observability must support both human and automated interpretation.

Observable information may include:

* build start and completion;
* stage progression;
* execution duration;
* validation status;
* failure classification;
* dependency information;
* artifact list;
* artifact sizes;
* checksums;
* toolchain context;
* environment context.

Observability must improve understanding without leaking protected information.

---

## Performance and Efficiency

Build reliability has priority over premature optimization.

However, build systems must remain sufficiently efficient to support productive engineering workflows.

Optimization areas may include:

* dependency caching;
* reusable environments;
* incremental work;
* parallel validation;
* artifact reuse;
* selective generation;
* CI optimization.

Optimizations must not compromise correctness, reproducibility, traceability, or validation.

---

## Build Governance Model

Build governance establishes how build decisions are made and maintained.

Significant architectural changes may require:

```text
Engineering Requirement
        ↓
Technical Analysis
        ↓
Architecture Decision
        ↓
Implementation
        ↓
Validation
        ↓
Documentation
        ↓
Framework Integration
```

Depending on scope, changes may require:

* direct documentation update;
* ADR;
* RFC;
* EPIC update;
* quality review;
* release coordination.

---

## Relationship With Engineering Foundation

EPIC-ENG-001 provides the engineering principles, repository conventions, workflows, tooling philosophy, environment expectations, and governance foundation upon which the Build Framework operates.

The Build Framework does not redefine those foundations.

Instead, it specializes them for build engineering.

---

## Relationship With Testing Framework

EPIC-TST-001 defines how FamilyOS verifies behavior through testing.

The Build Framework may invoke testing as part of validation workflows, but it does not own the testing model.

The relationship is:

```text
Build Process
     ↓
Applicable Test Execution
     ↓
Test Evidence
     ↓
Build Validation
```

---

## Relationship With Quality Framework

EPIC-QLT-001 defines the broader FamilyOS quality model.

The Build Framework implements build-specific quality controls and provides build evidence that can participate in quality gates.

```text
Quality Requirements
        ↓
Build Controls
        ↓
Build Evidence
        ↓
Quality Assessment
```

---

## Relationship With Documentation Framework

Build documentation must comply with FamilyOS documentation standards.

The Build Framework may also generate documentation artifacts, manifests, metadata, validation reports, and other machine-generated documentation outputs.

---

## Relationship With Plugin Architecture

FamilyOS official plugins may participate in build operations through:

* plugin packaging;
* metadata validation;
* capability manifests;
* generated resources;
* plugin compliance validation;
* artifact generation.

The Build Framework must therefore remain compatible with official plugin architecture and compliance requirements.

---

## Relationship With Release Framework

EPIC-REL-001 is the primary downstream framework.

The handoff occurs when a build artifact has satisfied its applicable build requirements.

```text
Build Framework
      │
      │ trusted artifact
      │ build evidence
      │ metadata
      ▼
Release Framework
```

The Release Framework may impose additional requirements before promotion or publication.

---

## Framework Architecture

EPIC-BLD-001 is organized around the following conceptual domains:

```text
Build Framework
│
├── Build Principles
├── Build Architecture
├── Build Lifecycle
├── Build Input Requirements
├── Build Inputs and Project Structure
├── Build Toolchain
├── Build Environment Management

├── Build Configuration
├── Build Philosophy
├── Build Execution
├── Artifact Management
├── Build Validation
├── Build Governance
├── Build Automation and CI
├── Roadmap
├── Framework Validation
└── Release Readiness
```

These domains form the normative foundation for future build implementation and automation.

---

```

Framework control documents include:

```text
EPIC-BLD-001.md
EPIC.yaml
README.md
MANIFEST.md
CHANGELOG.md
VALIDATION.md
Revision-History.md
```

Temporary migration documents are not part of the normative framework structure.

---

2. build principles are defined;
3. the build lifecycle is documented;
4. build inputs are explicitly modeled;

17. framework validation is complete;
18. no unresolved structural documentation inconsistencies remain;
19. implementation requirements are represented in the implementation checklist;
20. the framework is ready to serve as the normative basis for FamilyOS build engineering.

---

## Non-Goals

EPIC-BLD-001 does not attempt to:

* define every concrete build command;
* prescribe a single universal build tool for all future FamilyOS technologies;
* replace the Testing Framework;
* replace the Quality Framework;
* define complete release procedures;
* define deployment architecture;
* define production runtime behavior;
* optimize build performance before correctness;
* prematurely introduce complex build infrastructure;
* require advanced supply-chain technology before the platform needs it.

The framework establishes durable engineering foundations while allowing implementation maturity to evolve incrementally.

---

## Evolution Strategy

The Build Framework is expected to evolve progressively.

A likely maturity progression is:

```text
Level 1
Documented Build Process

        ↓

Level 2
Standardized Build Execution

        ↓

Level 3
Automated Validation

        ↓

Level 4
Reproducible Build Environments

        ↓

Level 5
Artifact Metadata and Provenance

        ↓

Level 6
Policy-Driven Build Governance

        ↓

Level 7
Advanced Supply-Chain Assurance
```

FamilyOS should advance through these levels according to actual engineering needs rather than infrastructure ambition alone.

---

## Foundational Rules

The following rules govern the Build Framework.

### Rule 1

Build inputs MUST be explicit wherever technically feasible.

### Rule 2

Build configuration MUST be controlled and inspectable.

### Rule 3

### Rule 10

Local and CI build semantics SHOULD remain aligned.

### Rule 11

Significant build architecture changes MUST follow FamilyOS governance.

---

## Expected Outcomes

When EPIC-BLD-001 is fully implemented, FamilyOS will have:

* a consistent build engineering model;
* reproducible and explainable build processes;
* clearer developer build workflows;

## Strategic Value

The Build Framework provides a critical transition in the maturity of FamilyOS.

Without it:

```text
Source Code
    ↓
Build Command
    ↓
Unknown Artifact
```

With it:

```text
Controlled Inputs
      ↓
Governed Build Process
      ↓
Validated Execution
      ↓
Identified Artifact
      ↓
Traceable Evidence
      ↓
Trusted Build Output
```

This difference is fundamental for a platform intended to evolve over many years.

## Final Principle

The Build Framework is founded on one final principle:

> FamilyOS must be able to explain not only what it builds, but how, from what, under which conditions, with which evidence, and why the resulting artifact can be trusted.

EPIC-BLD-001 establishes the engineering foundation required to make that principle systematic across the FamilyOS ecosystem.
